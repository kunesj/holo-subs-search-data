so okay what I did for this is because

5636
02:37:24,030 --> 02:37:24,040
so okay what I did for this is because
 

5637
02:37:24,040 --> 02:37:25,550
so okay what I did for this is because
we had a handful of people that

5638
02:37:25,550 --> 02:37:25,560
we had a handful of people that
 

5639
02:37:25,560 --> 02:37:29,630
we had a handful of people that
literally spelled it perfectly yeah is

5640
02:37:29,630 --> 02:37:29,640
literally spelled it perfectly yeah is
 

5641
02:37:29,640 --> 02:37:30,750
literally spelled it perfectly yeah is
it

5642
02:37:30,750 --> 02:37:30,760
it
 

5643
02:37:30,760 --> 02:37:33,830
it
just we get they're like what do we do

5644
02:37:33,830 --> 02:37:33,840
just we get they're like what do we do
 

5645
02:37:33,840 --> 02:37:37,389
just we get they're like what do we do
with that we have cuz oh sudden death

5646
02:37:37,389 --> 02:37:37,399
with that we have cuz oh sudden death
 

5647
02:37:37,399 --> 02:37:39,349
with that we have cuz oh sudden death
okay my my idea was that we take their

5648
02:37:39,349 --> 02:37:39,359
okay my my idea was that we take their
 

5649
02:37:39,359 --> 02:37:41,550
okay my my idea was that we take their
stars and we use it as like a multiplier

5650
02:37:41,550 --> 02:37:41,560
stars and we use it as like a multiplier
 

5651
02:37:41,560 --> 02:37:44,910
stars and we use it as like a multiplier
and then uh we multiply with how many

5652
02:37:44,910 --> 02:37:44,920
and then uh we multiply with how many
 

5653
02:37:44,920 --> 02:37:47,309
and then uh we multiply with how many
stars they had left for

5654
02:37:47,309 --> 02:37:47,319
stars they had left for
 

5655
02:37:47,319 --> 02:37:51,150
stars they had left for
example ah yeah if we take look here fua
