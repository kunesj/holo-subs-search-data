4337
01:48:25,679 --> 01:48:28,870
Break um the pr within is a puzzle
game the pr within is a puzzle game in

4338
01:48:28,870 --> 01:48:28,880
game the pr within is a puzzle game in
 

4339
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:32,310
game the pr within is a puzzle game in
which uh it's a co-op uh I've played it

4340
01:48:32,310 --> 01:48:32,320
which uh it's a co-op uh I've played it
 

4341
01:48:32,320 --> 01:48:34,390
which uh it's a co-op uh I've played it
with paa before basically one person is

4342
01:48:34,390 --> 01:48:34,400
with paa before basically one person is
 

4343
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:36,990
with paa before basically one person is
past and one person is future so because

4344
01:48:36,990 --> 01:48:37,000
past and one person is future so because
 

4345
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:38,669
past and one person is future so because
I played the future last time I want to

4346
01:48:38,669 --> 01:48:38,679
I played the future last time I want to
 

4347
01:48:38,679 --> 01:48:41,470
I played the future last time I want to
play past and you guys can play Future

4348
01:48:41,470 --> 01:48:41,480
play past and you guys can play Future
 

4349
01:48:41,480 --> 01:48:43,950
play past and you guys can play Future
so the game isn't actually connected so

4350
01:48:43,950 --> 01:48:43,960
so the game isn't actually connected so
 

4351
01:48:43,960 --> 01:48:46,270
so the game isn't actually connected so
it relies on like

4352
01:48:46,270 --> 01:48:46,280
it relies on like
 

4353
01:48:46,280 --> 01:48:48,870
it relies on like
confirmations and so that's why a lot of

4354
01:48:48,870 --> 01:48:48,880
confirmations and so that's why a lot of
 

4355
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:50,270
confirmations and so that's why a lot of
people can play together at the same

4356
01:48:50,270 --> 01:48:50,280
people can play together at the same
 

4357
01:48:50,280 --> 01:48:52,870
people can play together at the same
same time so I'm just going to like pick

4358
01:48:52,870 --> 01:48:52,880
same time so I'm just going to like pick
 

4359
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:54,950
same time so I'm just going to like pick
comments randomly and see how chaotic

4360
01:48:54,950 --> 01:48:54,960
