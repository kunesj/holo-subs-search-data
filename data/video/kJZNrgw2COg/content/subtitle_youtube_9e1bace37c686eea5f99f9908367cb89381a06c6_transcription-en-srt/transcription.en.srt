703
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,710
game gotcha that was the answer all
along the answer all along was just be

704
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:33,720
along the answer all along was just be
 

705
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,990
along the answer all along was just be
good at the game Kelly you silly dummy

706
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:36,000
good at the game Kelly you silly dummy

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,810
good at the game Kelly you silly dummy
here we go all right

708
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:38,820
here we go all right
 

709
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,490
here we go all right
my brain just it's very it's not very

710
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:40,500
my brain just it's very it's not very
 

711

big you guys but we're all cool with
that at this point I think if you're

714
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:43,320
that at this point I think if you're
 

715
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,810
that at this point I think if you're
still here by now you're pretty much

716
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:44,820
still here by now you're pretty much
 

717
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,570
still here by now you're pretty much
cool with that um here we go

718
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:47,580
cool with that um here we go
 

719
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,610
cool with that um here we go
all right now all the way

720
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:49,620
all right now all the way
 

721
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,130
all right now all the way
there we go there we go

00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,470
there we go there we go
the thick snow prohibits calculated

724
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:54,480
the thick snow prohibits calculated
 

725
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,110
the thick snow prohibits calculated
leaps no it doesn't only if you're an

726
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:57,120
leaps no it doesn't only if you're an
 

727
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,730
leaps no it doesn't only if you're an
idiot it's like if you have a math

728
00:20:58,730 --> 00:20:58,740
idiot it's like if you have a math
 

729
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,010
idiot it's like if you have a math
equation and you have to do like your

730
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:01,020
equation and you have to do like your
 

731
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,510
equation and you have to do like your
multiplication like times tables and

732
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:02,520
multiplication like times tables and
 

733
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,310
multiplication like times tables and
[\h__\h] but then at the end of it you have

734
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:04,320
[\h__\h] but then at the end of it you have
 

735
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,049
[\h__\h] but then at the end of it you have
like plus six you just gotta do PEMDAS

736
00:21:06,049 --> 00:21:06,059
like plus six you just gotta do PEMDAS
 

737
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:07,970
like plus six you just gotta do PEMDAS
man

738
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:07,980
man
 

739
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,590
man
yeah that really kind of had nothing to

740
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:09,600
yeah that really kind of had nothing to
 

741
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,510
yeah that really kind of had nothing to
do with anything at all that I was just

742
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:11,520
do with anything at all that I was just
 

743
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,270
do with anything at all that I was just
doing excuse me that was weird

744
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:14,280
doing excuse me that was weird
 

745
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:19,490
doing excuse me that was weird
all right

746
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:19,500

 

747
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,470

here we go now this is where stuff gets

748
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:21,480
here we go now this is where stuff gets
 

749
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,310
here we go now this is where stuff gets
wet

750
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:22,320
wet
 

751
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:22,909
wet
um

752
00:21:22,909 --> 00:21:22,919
um
 

753
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:26,390
um
real confusing

754
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:26,400

 

755
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,770

but bodmas did you learn something else

756
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:30,780

 

757
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:33,950

yeah PEMDAS it's math

758
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:33,960
yeah PEMDAS it's math
 

759
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,570
yeah PEMDAS it's math
yeah

760
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:35,580
yeah
 

761
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,029
yeah
gotta remember PEMDAS

762
00:21:38,029 --> 00:21:38,039
gotta remember PEMDAS
 

763
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:40,190
gotta remember PEMDAS
um all right so let me see how we did

764
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:40,200
um all right so let me see how we did
 

765
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,930
um all right so let me see how we did
this before we had to use the wind to

766
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:41,940
this before we had to use the wind to
 

767
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,850
this before we had to use the wind to
get up to the second stage

768
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:43,860
get up to the second stage
 

769
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,770
get up to the second stage
your call correctly we have to be super

770
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:45,780
your call correctly we have to be super
 

771
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,210
your call correctly we have to be super
careful though about jumping the same

772
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:47,220
careful though about jumping the same
 

773
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,710
careful though about jumping the same
direction the wind is going always have

774
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:48,720
direction the wind is going always have
 

775
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:55,610
direction the wind is going always have
to pay attention to that [\h__\h]

776
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:55,620

 

777
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,730

here not right now it's one of these

778
00:21:58,730 --> 00:21:58,740
here not right now it's one of these
 

779
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,750
here not right now it's one of these
ways

780
00:21:59,750 --> 00:21:59,760
ways
 

781
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,789
ways
one of these weighs up

782
00:22:01,789 --> 00:22:01,799
one of these weighs up
 

783
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:03,110
one of these weighs up
I wonder if I could Bounce Off the Wall

784
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:03,120
I wonder if I could Bounce Off the Wall
 

785
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,210
I wonder if I could Bounce Off the Wall
let's do a simple jump upward and what's

786
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:05,220
let's do a simple jump upward and what's
 

787
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,590
let's do a simple jump upward and what's
up here

788
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:06,600
up here
 

789
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,970
up here
we go

790
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:07,980
we go
 

791
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,289
we go
okay

792
00:22:09,289 --> 00:22:09,299
okay
 

793
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:13,190
okay
nice little gargoyle friend

794
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:13,200

 

795
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,529

no

796
00:22:15,529 --> 00:22:15,539
no
 

797
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:17,570
no
all right there is a little moment where

798
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:17,580
all right there is a little moment where
 

799
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,010
all right there is a little moment where
there's like no influence from the wind

800
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:19,020
there's like no influence from the wind
 

801
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,460
there's like no influence from the wind
which is pretty nice

802
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:21,470
which is pretty nice
 

803
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:26,570
which is pretty nice
[Music]

804
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:26,580

 

805
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,250

let's see what we get if we just jump

806
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:28,260
let's see what we get if we just jump
 

807
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,169
let's see what we get if we just jump
we'll power oh wow that was pretty close

808
00:22:30,169 --> 00:22:30,179
we'll power oh wow that was pretty close
 

809
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:32,450
we'll power oh wow that was pretty close
oh that was a close one

810
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:32,460
oh that was a close one
 

811
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,789
oh that was a close one
wait wait

812
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:34,799
wait wait
 

813
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:35,930
wait wait
all right

814
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:35,940
all right
 

815
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,850
all right
um

816
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:37,860
um
 

817
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,830
um
I try to jump yeah it'll just make the

818
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:39,840
I try to jump yeah it'll just make the
 

819
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,830
I try to jump yeah it'll just make the
jump like really short I think

820
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:42,840
jump like really short I think
 

821
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,990
jump like really short I think
all right there's a lot of calculation

822
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:45,000
all right there's a lot of calculation
 

823
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,850
all right there's a lot of calculation
you have to do here what I meant to say

824
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:46,860
you have to do here what I meant to say
 

825
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,169
you have to do here what I meant to say
when I was talking about the PEMDAS

826
00:22:48,169 --> 00:22:48,179
when I was talking about the PEMDAS
 

827
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:50,930
when I was talking about the PEMDAS
thing is that like you can calculate if

828
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:50,940
thing is that like you can calculate if
 

829
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:54,230
thing is that like you can calculate if
you add in the factors

830
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:54,240
you add in the factors
 

831
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,990
you add in the factors
like um how fast the wind is going the

832
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:57,000
like um how fast the wind is going the
 

833
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,890
like um how fast the wind is going the
other direction

834
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:03,900

 

835
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,390

so just how you would normally do things

836
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:05,400
so just how you would normally do things
 

837
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,430
so just how you would normally do things
but then you add like an extra plus

838
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:07,440
but then you add like an extra plus
 

839
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,750
but then you add like an extra plus
something something at the end like

840
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:08,760
something something at the end like
 

841
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,570
something something at the end like
you're doing math okay well that's fine

842
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:11,580
you're doing math okay well that's fine
 

843
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,810
you're doing math okay well that's fine
I can live with that

844
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:14,820

 

845
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:18,950

uh I can live with that

846
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:18,960

 

847
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,830

all right don't don't forget about the

848
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:21,840
all right don't don't forget about the
 

849
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:27,890
all right don't don't forget about the
wind is the thing

850
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:27,900

 

851
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:31,970

you can't forget about the wind

852
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:31,980

 

853
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,909

all right

854
00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:33,919
all right
 

855
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,409
all right
wait no no

856
00:23:36,409 --> 00:23:36,419
wait no no
 

857
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:42,710
wait no no
there we go that's what I wanted

858
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:42,720

 

859
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:48,470

okey dokey

860
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:48,480

 

861
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:56,149

I wonder how far we'll get today

862
00:23:56,149 --> 00:23:56,159

 

863
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,590

hmm

864
00:23:59,590 --> 00:23:59,600

 

865
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,029

I'm really really cautious about jumping

866
00:24:02,029 --> 00:24:02,039
I'm really really cautious about jumping
 

867
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:07,850
I'm really really cautious about jumping
like with the Wind

868
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:07,860

 

869
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,310

so this could take us a bit you guys

870
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:10,320
so this could take us a bit you guys
 

871
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,529
so this could take us a bit you guys

um oh no I'm real tilted right now it's
because if you if you go to the wind

9496
04:18:50,210 --> 04:18:50,220
because if you if you go to the wind
 

9497
04:18:50,220 --> 04:18:51,530
because if you if you go to the wind
level and then you get knocked out of

9498
04:18:51,530 --> 04:18:51,540
level and then you get knocked out of
 

9499
04:18:51,540 --> 04:18:53,269
level and then you get knocked out of
the wind level it completely changes how

9500
04:18:53,269 --> 04:18:53,279
the wind level it completely changes how
 

9501
04:18:53,279 --> 04:18:54,729
the wind level it completely changes how
the game feels

9502
04:18:54,729 --> 04:18:54,739
the game feels
 

9503
04:18:54,739 --> 04:18:58,969
the game feels
ah yeah it's bad I understand if it's a

9504
04:18:58,969 --> 04:18:58,979
ah yeah it's bad I understand if it's a
 

9505
04:18:58,979 --> 04:19:00,290
ah yeah it's bad I understand if it's a
game that I like I kind of want to

9506
04:19:00,290 --> 04:19:00,300
game that I like I kind of want to
 

9507
04:19:00,300 --> 04:19:03,649
game that I like I kind of want to
endure but otherwise yeah and Minecraft

9508
04:19:03,649 --> 04:19:03,659
endure but otherwise yeah and Minecraft
 

9509
04:19:03,659 --> 04:19:05,269
endure but otherwise yeah and Minecraft
is just kind of fun because like there's

9510
04:19:05,269 --> 04:19:05,279
is just kind of fun because like there's
 

9511
04:19:05,279 --> 04:19:06,769
is just kind of fun because like there's
so much you can do and like the time can

9512
04:19:06,769 --> 04:19:06,779
so much you can do and like the time can
 

9513
04:19:06,779 --> 04:19:09,950
so much you can do and like the time can
really just kind of fly away you know

9514
04:19:09,950 --> 04:19:09,960
really just kind of fly away you know
 

9515
04:19:09,960 --> 04:19:11,990
really just kind of fly away you know
yeah with Minecraft that would

9516
04:19:11,990 --> 04:19:12,000
yeah with Minecraft that would
 

9517
04:19:12,000 --> 04:19:13,969
yeah with Minecraft that would
understand

9518
04:19:13,969 --> 04:19:13,979
understand
 

9519
04:19:13,979 --> 04:19:15,590
understand
yeah I mean with this game you kind of

9520
04:19:15,590 --> 04:19:15,600
yeah I mean with this game you kind of
 

9521
04:19:15,600 --> 04:19:17,510
yeah I mean with this game you kind of
need to try and do it in Long spurts

9522
04:19:17,510 --> 04:19:17,520
need to try and do it in Long spurts
 

9523
04:19:17,520 --> 04:19:19,610
need to try and do it in Long spurts
because you can very easily forget how

9524
04:19:19,610 --> 04:19:19,620
because you can very easily forget how
 

9525
04:19:19,620 --> 04:19:21,170
because you can very easily forget how
to play the game and forget how to jump

9526
04:19:21,170 --> 04:19:21,180
to play the game and forget how to jump
 

9527
04:19:21,180 --> 04:19:23,870
to play the game and forget how to jump
in certain areas so it's recommended to

9528
04:19:23,870 --> 04:19:23,880
in certain areas so it's recommended to
 

9529
04:19:23,880 --> 04:19:27,010
in certain areas so it's recommended to
play for longer times yeah

9530
04:19:27,010 --> 04:19:27,020
play for longer times yeah
 

9531
04:19:27,020 --> 04:19:30,889
play for longer times yeah
that makes sense

9532
04:19:30,889 --> 04:19:30,899

 

9533
04:19:30,899 --> 04:19:33,349

it do be like that

9534
04:19:33,349 --> 04:19:33,359
it do be like that
 

9535
04:19:33,359 --> 04:19:35,450
it do be like that
but I don't know I'm having fun and it's

9536
04:19:35,450 --> 04:19:35,460
but I don't know I'm having fun and it's
 

9537
04:19:35,460 --> 04:19:37,250
but I don't know I'm having fun and it's
gonna feel great when I when I beat it

9538
04:19:37,250 --> 04:19:37,260
gonna feel great when I when I beat it
 

9539
04:19:37,260 --> 04:19:38,630
gonna feel great when I when I beat it
someday

9540
04:19:38,630 --> 04:19:38,640
someday
 

9541
04:19:38,640 --> 04:19:40,510
someday
Maybe

9542
04:19:40,510 --> 04:19:40,520
Maybe
 

9543
04:19:40,520 --> 04:19:43,389
Maybe
one day

9544
04:19:43,389 --> 04:19:43,399
one day
 

9545
04:19:43,399 --> 04:19:46,309
one day
today is the day I don't know about all

9546
04:19:46,309 --> 04:19:46,319
today is the day I don't know about all
 

9547
04:19:46,319 --> 04:19:49,370

that felt good yes and like you can feel
 

9551
04:19:51,359 --> 04:19:53,149
that felt good yes and like you can feel
you can feel when the jumps were correct

9552
04:19:53,149 --> 04:19:53,159
you can feel when the jumps were correct
 

9553
04:19:53,159 --> 04:19:56,210
you can feel when the jumps were correct

so it's like a good feeling when you get
 

9557
04:19:58,319 --> 04:20:01,610
so it's like a good feeling when you get
like a jump right but yeah

07:00:42,830 --> 07:00:42,840
I will I'll do it I'll do it this Chapel
 

16933
07:00:42,840 --> 07:00:44,570
I will I'll do it I'll do it this Chapel
is just it's way more terrifying than I

16934
07:00:44,570 --> 07:00:44,580
is just it's way more terrifying than I
 

16935
07:00:44,580 --> 07:00:58,010
is just it's way more terrifying than I
thought it was going to be foreign

16936
07:00:58,010 --> 07:00:58,020

 

16937
07:00:58,020 --> 07:00:59,570

because I keep thinking I can like step

16938
07:00:59,570 --> 07:00:59,580
because I keep thinking I can like step
 

16939
07:00:59,580 --> 07:01:01,368
because I keep thinking I can like step
on the candles or the fire but no that's

16940
07:01:01,368 --> 07:01:01,378
on the candles or the fire but no that's
 

16941
07:01:01,378 --> 07:01:02,868
on the candles or the fire but no that's
pretty dumb because then you burn and

16942
07:01:02,868 --> 07:01:02,878
pretty dumb because then you burn and
 

16943
07:01:02,878 --> 07:01:04,910
pretty dumb because then you burn and
hurt yourself oh you know what

16944
07:01:04,910 --> 07:01:04,920
hurt yourself oh you know what
 

16945
07:01:04,920 --> 07:01:06,650
hurt yourself oh you know what
makes sense I guess

16946
07:01:06,650 --> 07:01:06,660
makes sense I guess
 

16947
07:01:06,660 --> 07:01:08,270
makes sense I guess
this area is much easier than I thought

16948
07:01:08,270 --> 07:01:08,280
this area is much easier than I thought
 

16949
07:01:08,280 --> 07:01:09,948
this area is much easier than I thought
it would be

16950
07:01:09,948 --> 07:01:09,958
it would be
 

16951
07:01:09,958 --> 07:01:11,750
it would be
okay and now

16952
07:01:11,750 --> 07:01:11,760
okay and now
 

16953
07:01:11,760 --> 07:01:18,230
okay and now
we're in space no okay

16954
07:01:18,230 --> 07:01:18,240

 

16955
07:01:18,240 --> 07:01:20,810

okay

16956
07:01:20,810 --> 07:01:20,820
okay
 

16957
07:01:20,820 --> 07:01:22,628
okay
okay

16958
07:01:22,628 --> 07:01:22,638
okay
 

16959
07:01:22,638 --> 07:01:26,930
okay
all right all the way over now this part

16960
07:01:26,930 --> 07:01:26,940
all right all the way over now this part
 

16961
07:01:26,940 --> 07:01:29,390
all right all the way over now this part
here is rough because I'm like all right

16962
07:01:29,390 --> 07:01:29,400
here is rough because I'm like all right
 

16963
07:01:29,400 --> 07:01:31,128
here is rough because I'm like all right
I need to maybe jump

16964
07:01:31,128 --> 07:01:31,138
I need to maybe jump
 

16965
07:01:31,138 --> 07:01:34,030
I need to maybe jump
again no what stop stop

16966
07:01:34,030 --> 07:01:34,040
again no what stop stop
 

16967
07:01:34,040 --> 07:01:36,890
again no what stop stop
why I should do a full jump from the

16968
07:01:36,890 --> 07:01:36,900
why I should do a full jump from the
 

16969
07:01:36,900 --> 07:01:42,048
why I should do a full jump from the
corner okay I'm gonna try and do that

16970
07:01:42,048 --> 07:01:42,058

 

16971
07:01:42,058 --> 07:01:44,390

okay about so much memory stuff but I

16972
07:01:44,390 --> 07:01:44,400
okay about so much memory stuff but I
 

16973
07:01:44,400 --> 07:01:46,628
okay about so much memory stuff but I
have no memory ability

16974
07:01:46,628 --> 07:01:46,638
have no memory ability
 

16975
07:01:46,638 --> 07:01:51,048
have no memory ability
at this point it must be muscle memory

16976
07:01:51,048 --> 07:01:51,058
at this point it must be muscle memory
 

16977
07:01:51,058 --> 07:01:54,890
at this point it must be muscle memory
hour eight yes you are correct actually

16978
07:01:54,890 --> 07:01:54,900
hour eight yes you are correct actually
 

16979
07:01:54,900 --> 07:01:56,990
hour eight yes you are correct actually
it is a lot of muscle memory

16980
07:01:56,990 --> 07:01:57,000
it is a lot of muscle memory
 

16981
07:01:57,000 --> 07:01:59,510
it is a lot of muscle memory
interestingly enough

16982
07:01:59,510 --> 07:01:59,520
interestingly enough
 

16983
07:01:59,520 --> 07:02:01,490
interestingly enough
which is better than my regular memory

16984
07:02:01,490 --> 07:02:01,500
which is better than my regular memory
 

16985
07:02:01,500 --> 07:02:04,570
which is better than my regular memory
so I guess I should be thankful

16986
07:02:04,570 --> 07:02:04,580
so I guess I should be thankful
 

16987
07:02:04,580 --> 07:02:10,128
so I guess I should be thankful

07:49:57,600 --> 07:49:59,570
something I'm not sure I was thinking
well let's see it's almost been about

19174
07:49:59,570 --> 07:49:59,580
well let's see it's almost been about
 

19175
07:49:59,580 --> 07:50:02,448
well let's see it's almost been about
eight hours by now gura estimated that I

19176
07:50:02,448 --> 07:50:02,458
eight hours by now gura estimated that I
 

19177
07:50:02,458 --> 07:50:03,830
eight hours by now gura estimated that I
could meet the Babe in like two and a

19178
07:50:03,830 --> 07:50:03,840
could meet the Babe in like two and a
 

19179
07:50:03,840 --> 07:50:05,570
could meet the Babe in like two and a
half maybe about half an hour ago maybe

19180
07:50:05,570 --> 07:50:05,580
half maybe about half an hour ago maybe
 

19181
07:50:05,580 --> 07:50:07,190
half maybe about half an hour ago maybe
she's a no she said two and a half I

19182
07:50:07,190 --> 07:50:07,200
she's a no she said two and a half I
 

19183
07:50:07,200 --> 07:50:09,708
she's a no she said two and a half I
think so yeah maybe two more hours I'll

19184
07:50:09,708 --> 07:50:09,718
think so yeah maybe two more hours I'll
 

19185
