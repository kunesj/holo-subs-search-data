we all knew that this was coming

768
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:12,640
we all knew that this was coming
 

769
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,029
we all knew that this was coming
um let's see if if we can be lucky

770
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:15,039
um let's see if if we can be lucky
 

771
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,029
um let's see if if we can be lucky
because i'm not sure

772
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:17,039
because i'm not sure
 

773
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,430
because i'm not sure
a lot of free pulls a lot of free pulls

774
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:19,440
a lot of free pulls a lot of free pulls
 

775
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,750
a lot of free pulls a lot of free pulls
right so we're gonna do all of them

776
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:21,760
right so we're gonna do all of them
 

777
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,669
right so we're gonna do all of them
uh yeah i mean i'd like to but mainly

778
00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:23,679
uh yeah i mean i'd like to but mainly
 

779
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,190
uh yeah i mean i'd like to but mainly
what we're trying to do here is

780
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:25,200
what we're trying to do here is
 

781
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,789
what we're trying to do here is
we're doing the uh the guaranteed

782
00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:26,799
we're doing the uh the guaranteed
 

783
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,190
we're doing the uh the guaranteed
selectable six

784
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:29,200
selectable six
 

785
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,789
selectable six
is the main gotcha we're doing so go to

786
00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:30,799
is the main gotcha we're doing so go to
 

787
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,390
is the main gotcha we're doing so go to
the shop summons characters

788
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:34,400
the shop summons characters
 

789
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,750
the shop summons characters
choose a six star summons so basically

790
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:37,760
choose a six star summons so basically
 

791
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,270
choose a six star summons so basically
you get one of five characters

792
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:39,280
you get one of five characters
 

793
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,230
you get one of five characters
chosen by you and um and now let's try

794
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:42,240
chosen by you and um and now let's try
 

795
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:42,470
chosen by you and um and now let's try
to

796
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:42,480
to
 

797
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,710
to
use that in the co-op exactly we'll use

798
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:44,720
use that in the co-op exactly we'll use
 

799
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,149
use that in the co-op exactly we'll use
the character that we get

800
00:20:46,149 --> 00:20:46,159
the character that we get
 

801
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,029
the character that we get
uh in the co-op so yeah do you want to

802
00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:49,039
uh in the co-op so yeah do you want to
 

803
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:49,830
uh in the co-op so yeah do you want to
go play

804
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:49,840
go play
 

805
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,470
go play
sure let's do select for free let's

806
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:52,480
sure let's do select for free let's
 

807
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,230
sure let's do select for free let's
enter the gotcha hell let's

808
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:54,240
enter the gotcha hell let's
 

809
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,510
enter the gotcha hell let's
go into the catcher here we go

810
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:57,520
go into the catcher here we go
 

811
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,470
go into the catcher here we go
all right so we go and we get only one

812
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:00,480
all right so we go and we get only one
 

813
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,430
all right so we go and we get only one
right

814
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:01,440
right
 

815
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,149
right
uh yes so basically you choose five

816
00:21:04,149 --> 00:21:04,159
uh yes so basically you choose five
 

817
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,310
uh yes so basically you choose five

821
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,350
you can see details use character by
