00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:52,909
good balance of members yeah I was about
to say this is probably the era that I

1330
00:32:52,909 --> 00:32:52,919
to say this is probably the era that I
 

1331
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:55,610
to say this is probably the era that I
am most familiar with when it comes to

1332
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:55,620
am most familiar with when it comes to
 

1333
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,409
am most familiar with when it comes to
yeah

1334
00:32:57,409 --> 00:32:57,419
yeah
 

1335
00:32:57,419 --> 00:32:59,330
yeah
there are a lot of people yeah

1336
00:32:59,330 --> 00:32:59,340
there are a lot of people yeah
 

1337
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:02,630
there are a lot of people yeah
I feel like it's probably really biased

1338
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:02,640
I feel like it's probably really biased
 

1339
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,250
I feel like it's probably really biased
like everyone who says this is my best

1340
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:04,260
like everyone who says this is my best
 

1341
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,570
like everyone who says this is my best
error and this is my best error because

1342
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:05,580
error and this is my best error because
 

1343
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,610
error and this is my best error because
it's probably just like where you were

1344
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:07,620
it's probably just like where you were
 

1345
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:11,389
it's probably just like where you were
like kind of like where you got into it

1346
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:11,399
like kind of like where you got into it
 

1347
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:14,389
like kind of like where you got into it
for most people yeah like because that's

1348
00:33:14,389 --> 00:33:14,399
for most people yeah like because that's
 

1349
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,730
for most people yeah like because that's
the era when I got into it too so that's

1350
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:16,740
the era when I got into it too so that's
 

1351
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:19,370
the era when I got into it too so that's
why I think that's the best ERA like I

1352
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:19,380
why I think that's the best ERA like I
 

1353
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,649
why I think that's the best ERA like I
couldn't really a little bit before yeah

1354
00:33:21,649 --> 00:33:21,659
couldn't really a little bit before yeah
 

1355
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:22,909
couldn't really a little bit before yeah
I think you're maybe a little bit of an

1356
00:33:22,909 --> 00:33:22,919
I think you're maybe a little bit of an
 

1357
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:25,970
I think you're maybe a little bit of an
exception but this is

1358
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:25,980
exception but this is
 

1359
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:29,750
exception but this is
the best ERA yeah yeah so this

1360
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:29,760
the best ERA yeah yeah so this
 

1361
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,850
the best ERA yeah yeah so this
is an interesting error because they

1362
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:31,860
is an interesting error because they
 

1363
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:34,669
is an interesting error because they
didn't change usually they held an uh

1364
00:33:34,669 --> 00:33:34,679
didn't change usually they held an uh
 

1365
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:37,909
didn't change usually they held an uh
graduation or added members every single

1366
00:33:37,909 --> 00:33:37,919
graduation or added members every single
 

1367
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:39,710

year but
 

1369
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,870
year but
um from

1370
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:40,880
um from
 

1371
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,810
um from
2007 to 2009 they didn't have any

1372
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:44,820
2007 to 2009 they didn't have any
 

1373
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:48,230
2007 to 2009 they didn't have any
graduations well mid-2007 to late 2009.

1374

it was so stable yeah it was very stable
 

1377
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,490
it was so stable yeah it was very stable
this thing is a nine piece for a while

1378
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:52,500
this thing is a nine piece for a while
 

1379
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,430
this thing is a nine piece for a while
you felt that really yeah I think that's

1380
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:55,440
you felt that really yeah I think that's
