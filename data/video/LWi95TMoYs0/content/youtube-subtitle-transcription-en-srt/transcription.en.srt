well
I'll try it

3354
01:29:49,870 --> 01:29:49,880

 

3355
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:53,229

uh it's stuck together but

3356
01:29:53,229 --> 01:29:53,239
uh it's stuck together but
 

3357
01:29:53,239 --> 01:29:56,629
uh it's stuck together but
it's not exactly where at all how I

3358
01:29:56,629 --> 01:29:56,639
it's not exactly where at all how I
 

3359
01:29:56,639 --> 01:29:58,850
it's not exactly where at all how I
wanted it but okay

3360

wanted it but okay
 

3361
01:29:58,860 --> 01:30:00,950
wanted it but okay
I think you guys know how I wanted it

I think you guys know how I wanted it
 

3363
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:02,990
I think you guys know how I wanted it
but it's okay well I'll figure this one

3364
01:30:02,990 --> 01:30:03,000
but it's okay well I'll figure this one
 

3365
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:03,770
but it's okay well I'll figure this one
out

3366
01:30:03,770 --> 01:30:03,780
out
 

3367
01:30:03,780 --> 01:30:09,590
out
uh first bring it up higher

3368
01:30:09,590 --> 01:30:09,600

 

3369
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:13,490

3371
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:15,709

we can also turn it like this yeah yeah

3372
01:30:15,709 --> 01:30:15,719
we can also turn it like this yeah yeah
 

3373
01:30:15,719 --> 01:30:20,930
we can also turn it like this yeah yeah
yeah yeah

3374
01:30:20,930 --> 01:30:20,940

 

3375
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:22,810

why is it such a

3376
01:30:22,810 --> 01:30:22,820
why is it such a
 

3377
01:30:22,820 --> 01:30:26,270
why is it such a
why do I have to move it by such big

3378
01:30:26,270 --> 01:30:26,280
why do I have to move it by such big
 

3379
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:28,189
why do I have to move it by such big
like distances you know what I mean

3380
01:30:28,189 --> 01:30:28,199
like distances you know what I mean
 

3381
01:30:28,199 --> 01:30:32,090
like distances you know what I mean
there's no like more I guess if I turn

3382
01:30:32,090 --> 01:30:32,100
there's no like more I guess if I turn
 

3383
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:34,189
there's no like more I guess if I turn
my own body I can turn it a bit more

3384
01:30:34,189 --> 01:30:34,199
my own body I can turn it a bit more
 

3385
01:30:34,199 --> 01:30:37,030
my own body I can turn it a bit more
exact

8118
03:43:15,650 --> 03:43:15,660

 

8119
03:43:15,660 --> 03:43:19,690

first

8120
03:43:19,690 --> 03:43:19,700

 

8121
03:43:19,700 --> 03:43:22,370

it doesn't really look like really

8122
03:43:22,370 --> 03:43:22,380
it doesn't really look like really
 

8123
03:43:22,380 --> 03:43:24,170
it doesn't really look like really
there's any axes on the right side

8124
03:43:24,170 --> 03:43:24,180
there's any axes on the right side
 

8125
03:43:24,180 --> 03:43:25,309
there's any axes on the right side
either

8126
03:43:25,309 --> 03:43:25,319
either
 

8127
03:43:25,319 --> 03:43:29,210
either
oh wait here

8128
03:43:29,210 --> 03:43:29,220

 

8129
03:43:29,220 --> 03:43:32,150

maybe I can go behind the waterfall and

8130
03:43:32,150 --> 03:43:32,160
maybe I can go behind the waterfall and
 

8131
03:43:32,160 --> 03:43:34,190
maybe I can go behind the waterfall and
then on the right side looks like I can

8132
03:43:34,190 --> 03:43:34,200
then on the right side looks like I can
 

8133
03:43:34,200 --> 03:43:41,870
then on the right side looks like I can
climb there

8134
03:43:41,870 --> 03:43:41,880

 

8135
03:43:41,880 --> 03:43:44,750

see I can go behind it

8136
03:43:44,750 --> 03:43:44,760
see I can go behind it
 

8137
03:43:44,760 --> 03:43:46,670
see I can go behind it
yeah yeah

8138
03:43:46,670 --> 03:43:46,680
yeah yeah
 

8139
03:43:46,680 --> 03:43:51,530
yeah yeah
but that's a long way to climb

8140
03:43:51,530 --> 03:43:51,540
but that's a long way to climb
 

8141
03:43:51,540 --> 03:43:58,190
but that's a long way to climb
maybe I'll use one of my stamina items

8142
03:43:58,190 --> 03:43:58,200

 

8143
03:43:58,200 --> 03:44:00,170

so laggy did you get the output I don't

8144
03:44:00,170 --> 03:44:00,180
so laggy did you get the output I don't
 

8145
03:44:00,180 --> 03:44:02,809
so laggy did you get the output I don't
really feel like it's laggy is it

8146
03:44:02,809 --> 03:44:02,819
really feel like it's laggy is it
 

8147
03:44:02,819 --> 03:44:09,170
really feel like it's laggy is it
maybe that's just my stream

8148
03:44:09,170 --> 03:44:09,180

 

8149
03:44:09,180 --> 03:44:12,710

and I mean I installed it before a

8150
03:44:12,710 --> 03:44:12,720
and I mean I installed it before a
 

8151
03:44:12,720 --> 03:44:15,410
and I mean I installed it before a
couple hours before the stream so

8152
03:44:15,410 --> 03:44:15,420
couple hours before the stream so
 

8153
03:44:15,420 --> 03:44:18,790
couple hours before the stream so
probably most recent

8154
03:44:18,790 --> 03:44:18,800
probably most recent
 

8155
03:44:18,800 --> 03:44:22,729
probably most recent
okay no lag

8156
03:44:22,729 --> 03:44:22,739

 

8157
03:44:22,739 --> 03:44:24,530

I think this is the intended path yeah

8158
03:44:24,530 --> 03:44:24,540
I think this is the intended path yeah
 

8159
03:44:24,540 --> 03:44:26,570
I think this is the intended path yeah
because I can climb relatively easily

8160
03:44:26,570 --> 03:44:26,580
because I can climb relatively easily
 

8161
03:44:26,580 --> 03:44:34,190
because I can climb relatively easily
too

8162
03:44:34,190 --> 03:44:34,200

 

8163
03:44:34,200 --> 03:44:40,370

it was

8164

uh collab
and then you reflect a projectile and

13202
06:03:30,708 --> 06:03:30,718
and then you reflect a projectile and
 

13203
06:03:30,718 --> 06:03:33,830
and then you reflect a projectile and
they do it at the same time then it

13204
06:03:33,830 --> 06:03:33,840
they do it at the same time then it
 

13205
06:03:33,840 --> 06:03:38,208
they do it at the same time then it
creates this like huge

13206
