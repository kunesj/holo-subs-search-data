00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:40,080
roll perception
 

1259
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,789
roll perception
both of us yeah uh sure if you'd like

1260
00:33:42,789 --> 00:33:42,799
both of us yeah uh sure if you'd like

let's do
both double the power okay

1264
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:47,360
both double the power okay
 

1265
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,990
both double the power okay

kind of able to perceive
 

1271
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,269
kind of able to perceive
um that these flowers are the same ones

1272

they go for a little ways but

1284
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:10,399
they go for a little ways but
 

1285
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:11,990
they go for a little ways but
interestingly enough they stop and they

1286
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:12,000
interestingly enough they stop and they
 

1287
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,149
interestingly enough they stop and they
don't branch off into any other

1288
00:34:14,149 --> 00:34:14,159
don't branch off into any other
 

1289
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,149
don't branch off into any other
any other direction they just kind of

1290
00:34:16,149 --> 00:34:16,159
any other direction they just kind of
 

1291
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,069
any other direction they just kind of
become a bit less and less

1292
00:34:18,069 --> 00:34:18,079
become a bit less and less
 

1293
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,190
become a bit less and less

bashing it's how much aggro damage

2892
01:11:43,350 --> 01:11:43,360
bashing it's how much aggro damage
 

2893
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:46,229
bashing it's how much aggro damage
um so basically you have bashing it will

2894
01:11:46,229 --> 01:11:46,239
um so basically you have bashing it will
 

2895
01:11:46,239 --> 01:11:47,270
um so basically you have bashing it will
turn into lethal

2896
01:11:47,270 --> 01:11:47,280
turn into lethal
 

2897
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:49,350
turn into lethal
if you continue to accumulate it which

2898
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:49,360
if you continue to accumulate it which
 

2899
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:51,750
if you continue to accumulate it which
is an x not a slash

2900
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:51,760
is an x not a slash
 

2901
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:53,350
is an x not a slash
and then lethal will turn into

2902
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:53,360
and then lethal will turn into
 

2903
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:55,430
and then lethal will turn into
aggravated damage which will turn into a

2904
01:11:55,430 --> 01:11:55,440

this situation
okay if you're looking for information

3670
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:23,760
okay if you're looking for information
 

3671
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:25,430
okay if you're looking for information
let's go ahead and roll a perception

3672
01:29:25,430 --> 01:29:25,440
let's go ahead and roll a perception
 

3673
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:26,950
let's go ahead and roll a perception
check again if you're looking for useful

3674

check again if you're looking for useful
 

3675
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:28,709
check again if you're looking for useful
items you can roll a survival check

3676
01:29:28,709 --> 01:29:28,719
items you can roll a survival check
 

3677
01:29:28,719 --> 01:29:30,390
items you can roll a survival check
which one would you like to do

3678

survival sorry
 

3685
01:29:37,199 --> 01:29:40,790
survival sorry
can i get the perception to look for

3686
01:29:40,790 --> 01:29:40,800
can i get the perception to look for
 

3687
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:44,070
can i get the perception to look for
sure yeah teamwork information

3688
01:29:44,070 --> 01:29:44,080
sure yeah teamwork information
 

3689
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:47,350
sure yeah teamwork information
yeah let's do it teamwork

3690
01:29:47,350 --> 01:29:47,360

weaponry plus decks not dexterity sorry

5826
02:16:27,510 --> 02:16:27,520
weaponry plus decks not dexterity sorry
 

5827
02:16:27,520 --> 02:16:28,950
weaponry plus decks not dexterity sorry
weaponry plus strength

5828
02:16:28,950 --> 02:16:28,960
weaponry plus strength
 

5829
02:16:28,960 --> 02:16:30,470
weaponry plus strength
and i'm gonna give it a minus one

5830
02:16:30,470 --> 02:16:30,480
and i'm gonna give it a minus one
 

5831
02:16:30,480 --> 02:16:31,990
and i'm gonna give it a minus one
because this is a shovel and not

5832
02:16:31,990 --> 02:16:32,000
because this is a shovel and not
 

5833
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,549
because this is a shovel and not
necessarily a weapon

5834

necessarily a weapon
 

5835
02:16:34,559 --> 02:16:36,309
necessarily a weapon
bam anything is a weapon if you believe

5836

bam anything is a weapon if you believe
 

5837
02:16:36,319 --> 02:16:38,230
bam anything is a weapon if you believe
in it true facts i guess

5838
02:16:38,230 --> 02:16:38,240
in it true facts i guess
 

5839
02:16:38,240 --> 02:16:39,910
in it true facts i guess
but still go ahead and take a minus one

5840
02:16:39,910 --> 02:16:39,920
but still go ahead and take a minus one
 

5841
02:16:39,920 --> 02:16:42,549
but still go ahead and take a minus one
and then for taser n is one

5842
02:16:42,549 --> 02:16:42,559
and then for taser n is one
 

5843
02:16:42,559 --> 02:16:45,750
and then for taser n is one
minus one unless you have um a specialty

5844
02:16:45,750 --> 02:16:45,760
minus one unless you have um a specialty
 

5845
02:16:45,760 --> 02:16:47,190
minus one unless you have um a specialty
