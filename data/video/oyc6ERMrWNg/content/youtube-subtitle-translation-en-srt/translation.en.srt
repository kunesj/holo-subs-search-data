00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:28,110
Hey, how long does it take you to eat ramen?
Everyone can finish it in like 5 minutes, right? You

501
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:28,120
Everyone can finish it in like 5 minutes, right? You
 

502
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,400
Everyone can finish it in like 5 minutes, right? You
finish it in a flash, right?

503
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:32,410

 

504
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:36,910

5 minutes, oh no, 3 minutes,

505
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:36,920
5 minutes, oh no, 3 minutes,
 

506
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:40,770
5 minutes, oh no, 3 minutes,
but I don't think it's 3 hours.

507
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:40,780
but I don't think it's 3 hours.
 

508
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:45,910
but I don't think it's 3 hours.
Sometimes I can finish it in 30 minutes.  That way of

509
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,079

 

510
00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:47,089

 

511
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:53,190

eating is the norm. Well, it's not a fork and spoon, but

512
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:55,110
eating is the norm. Well, it's not a fork and spoon, but
 

513
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:55,120

 

514
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,369

it's okay.  It's

515
00:16:57,369 --> 00:16:57,379
it's okay.  It's
 

516
00:16:57,379 --> 00:17:02,650
it's okay.  It's
said that the farmers who grow really slowly grow, but I

517
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:02,660
said that the farmers who grow really slowly grow, but I
 

518
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,180
said that the farmers who grow really slowly grow, but I
don't have that feeling. I've

519
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:08,660
don't have that feeling. I've
 

520
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,420

 

521
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:11,430

 

522
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:15,530

never noticed anything about Nobita's views growing. I don't know if it really grows or not.  Well, I think that

523
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:15,540
never noticed anything about Nobita's views growing. I don't know if it really grows or not.  Well, I think that
 

524
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:19,010
never noticed anything about Nobita's views growing. I don't know if it really grows or not.  Well, I think that
if it grows, it means

525
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:19,020
if it grows, it means
 

526
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:24,020
if it grows, it means
that there will be more sides and therefore more to eat. It's a

527
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:24,030
that there will be more sides and therefore more to eat. It's a
 

528
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:30,740
that there will be more sides and therefore more to eat. It's a
good thing that it grows. One and five are good things.

529
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:30,750

 

530
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,680

Oh,

you use things like "cha-chan"? It's a really good read. Yes, I know. The trick to becoming able to use English well is to learn it. That's not right. You just have to get used to it. I'm Japanese.  There

1638
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:53,730

was only one way I learned Japanese. I didn't use any language skills or have any teachers. There was only one way I learned Japanese, and that was

was only one way I learned Japanese. I didn't use any language skills or have any teachers. There was only one way I learned Japanese, and that was
through conversation or communication. So if you do that every day with English, you'll

1641
00:55:02,410 --> 00:55:02,420
through conversation or communication. So if you do that every day with English, you'll
 

1642
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:05,190
through conversation or communication. So if you do that every day with English, you'll
definitely become fluent.

1643
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:05,200
definitely become fluent.
 

1644
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:09,260
definitely become fluent.
But you really have to use it every day. You can talk to yourself. I

1645
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:12,430
But you really have to use it every day. You can talk to yourself. I
 

1646

1647
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:15,430

 

1648
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:21,780

think it's fine to do it every day, or you can use Skype. You'd be a good kid if you could give me some chocolate.

1649
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:21,790
think it's fine to do it every day, or you can use Skype. You'd be a good kid if you could give me some chocolate.

think it's fine to do it every day, or you can use Skype. You'd be a good kid if you could give me some chocolate.
Or you could do some English broadcasts on YouTube or something like that.

1651
00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:30,800
Or you could do some English broadcasts on YouTube or something like that.
 

1652
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:30,810

 

1653
00:55:30,810 --> 00:55:33,150

If you do it, you will be able to

1654
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:35,350
If you do it, you will be able to
 

1655
00:55:35,350 --> 00:55:35,360

 

1656
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:39,490

improve your pronunciation.

1657
00:55:39,490 --> 00:55:39,500
improve your pronunciation.
 

1658
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:44,230
improve your pronunciation.
If you come across a word you don't know, you will immediately write it down.

1659
00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:44,240
If you come across a word you don't know, you will immediately write it down.
 

1660

If you come across a word you don't know, you will immediately write it down.
When I learned Japanese, I didn't know that.  Whenever I came across a word I didn't

1661
00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:50,060
When I learned Japanese, I didn't know that.  Whenever I came across a word I didn't
 

1662
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:55,430
When I learned Japanese, I didn't know that.  Whenever I came across a word I didn't
know, I didn't take notes because I was lazy and thought it was too much trouble,

1663
00:55:55,430 --> 00:55:55,440
know, I didn't take notes because I was lazy and thought it was too much trouble,
 

1664
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:59,780
know, I didn't take notes because I was lazy and thought it was too much trouble,
but I would at least look up the meaning and

1665
00:55:59,780 --> 00:55:59,790
but I would at least look up the meaning and
 

1666
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:04,070
but I would at least look up the meaning and
try to use that word right away.

1667
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:04,080
try to use that word right away.
 

1668
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:10,710
try to use that word right away.
And then I couldn't get it out of my head. Well, maybe I'm a special case.

1669
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:10,720
And then I couldn't get it out of my head. Well, maybe I'm a special case.
 

1670
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:17,050
And then I couldn't get it out of my head. Well, maybe I'm a special case.
Yes, I don't think there are many people who can memorize things that quickly.

1671
00:56:17,050 --> 00:56:17,060
Yes, I don't think there are many people who can memorize things that quickly.
 

1672
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:21,100
Yes, I don't think there are many people who can memorize things that quickly.
But it's

1673
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:21,110
But it's
 

1674
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:28,070
But it's
better to write it down so that you can use it when you get the chance.  I

1675
00:56:28,070 --> 00:56:28,080
better to write it down so that you can use it when you get the chance.  I
 

1676
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:33,809
better to write it down so that you can use it when you get the chance.  I
think it will be sweet, and the communication part is drawn.

1677
00:56:33,809 --> 00:56:33,819
think it will be sweet, and the communication part is drawn.
 

1678
00:56:33,819 --> 00:56:35,410
think it will be sweet, and the communication part is drawn.

1679
00:56:35,410 --> 00:56:35,420

 

1680
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:40,240

Yes, even with such bones, the 5th frame is

1681
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:40,250
Yes, even with such bones, the 5th frame is
 

1682
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:45,550
Yes, even with such bones, the 5th frame is
difficult. It's difficult, especially for me, for example, the other child,

1683
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:45,560
difficult. It's difficult, especially for me, for example, the other child,
 

1684
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:49,390
difficult. It's difficult, especially for me, for example, the other child,
for example, I

1685
00:56:49,390 --> 00:56:49,400
for example, I
 

1686
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:56,620
for example, I
tried to learn Italian, but the pain is like this.  Well, it didn't really sink in at all,

1687
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:56,630
tried to learn Italian, but the pain is like this.  Well, it didn't really sink in at all,
 

1688
00:56:56,630 --> 00:56:59,700
tried to learn Italian, but the pain is like this.  Well, it didn't really sink in at all,
and I

1689
00:56:59,700 --> 00:56:59,710

 

1690
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:02,579

wonder why. And the

1691
00:57:02,579 --> 00:57:02,589
wonder why. And the
 

1692
00:57:02,589 --> 00:57:04,120
wonder why. And the
other thing is, I didn't

1693
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:04,130
other thing is, I didn't
 

1694
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:06,350
other thing is, I didn't
talk to her. And the

1695
00:57:06,350 --> 00:57:06,360
talk to her. And the
 

1696
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:09,530
talk to her. And the
second thing is, I wasn't interested. So, if you're

1697
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:09,540
second thing is, I wasn't interested. So, if you're
 

1698
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:16,020
second thing is, I wasn't interested. So, if you're
not really interested, you can't remember it.

1699
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:16,030
not really interested, you can't remember it.
 

1700
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:20,410
not really interested, you can't remember it.
And there's no conversation.  No,

1701
00:57:20,410 --> 00:57:20,420

 

1702
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:22,040


1703
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:22,050

 

1704
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:27,069

I'm

1705
00:57:27,069 --> 00:57:28,270

 

1706
00:57:28,270 --> 00:57:28,280

 

1707
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:29,400


1708
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:29,410

 

1709
00:57:29,410 --> 00:57:30,960

collecting the number of people. Is

1710
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:30,970
collecting the number of people. Is
 

1711
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:34,450
collecting the number of people. Is
this it?

1712
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:34,460

 

1713
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:36,770


1714
00:57:36,770 --> 00:57:36,780

 

1715
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:40,570

Did you learn something from what I said

1716
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:40,580
Did you learn something from what I said
 

1717
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:45,560
Did you learn something from what I said
? I think you learned a little bit.

1718
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:49,040

 

1719
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:49,050

 

1720
00:57:49,050 --> 00:57:52,570

Interest is the most important thing.

1721
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:52,580

 

1722
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:55,700

Interest and motivation are key.  I

1723
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:55,710
Interest and motivation are key.  I
 

1724
00:57:55,710 --> 00:58:01,099
Interest and motivation are key.  I
think your Japanese is really good, but sometimes I

1725
00:58:01,099 --> 00:58:01,109
think your Japanese is really good, but sometimes I
 

1726
00:58:01,109 --> 00:58:04,970
think your Japanese is really good, but sometimes I
feel like it sounds like a Kansai dialect. Have you ever been there? Well, I'm

1727
00:58:04,970 --> 00:58:04,980
feel like it sounds like a Kansai dialect. Have you ever been there? Well, I'm
 

1728
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:09,200
feel like it sounds like a Kansai dialect. Have you ever been there? Well, I'm
not here now, but have you ever lived in Kansai?

1729
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:09,210
not here now, but have you ever lived in Kansai?
 

1730
00:58:09,210 --> 00:58:10,450
not here now, but have you ever lived in Kansai?
Well, it

1731
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:10,460
Well, it
 

1732
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:14,470
Well, it
wasn't for long, but I have lived there.  I wonder

1733
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:14,480
wasn't for long, but I have lived there.  I wonder
 

1734
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,680
wasn't for long, but I have lived there.  I wonder
if that was the influence.  I was

1735
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:20,200
if that was the influence.  I was
 

1736
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:20,210

 

1737
00:58:20,210 --> 00:58:25,040

always speaking in Kansai dialect and people would

1738
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:25,050
always speaking in Kansai dialect and people would
 

1739
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:31,230
always speaking in Kansai dialect and people would
say "5" and tell me I was a patient. I

1740
00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:31,240
say "5" and tell me I was a patient. I
 

1741
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:35,940
say "5" and tell me I was a patient. I
didn't even realize it myself, but now I don't say it much anymore, but sometimes I say "5" a little bit.  I

1742
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:35,950
didn't even realize it myself, but now I don't say it much anymore, but sometimes I say "5" a little bit.  I

think you and him will probably say "house" when you introduce yourself.

1744
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,400
think you and him will probably say "house" when you introduce yourself.
