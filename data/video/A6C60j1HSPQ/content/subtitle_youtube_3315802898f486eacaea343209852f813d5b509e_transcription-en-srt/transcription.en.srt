9132
03:59:54,110 --> 03:59:54,120
I
 

9133
03:59:54,120 --> 03:59:56,090
I
I was like

9134
03:59:56,090 --> 03:59:56,100

9140
04:00:10,790 --> 04:00:10,800

 

9141
04:00:10,800 --> 04:00:14,630

so I looked over

9142
04:00:14,630 --> 04:00:14,640

 

9143
04:00:14,640 --> 04:00:17,229

to where she was then

9144
04:00:17,229 --> 04:00:17,239
to where she was then
 

9145
04:00:17,239 --> 04:00:22,130
to where she was then
and I it's it was like pretty much

9146
04:00:22,130 --> 04:00:22,140
and I it's it was like pretty much
 

9147
04:00:22,140 --> 04:00:23,410
and I it's it was like pretty much
impossible

9148
04:00:23,410 --> 04:00:23,420
impossible
 

9149
04:00:23,420 --> 04:00:26,689
impossible
to just like pick her up

9150
04:00:26,689 --> 04:00:26,699
to just like pick her up
 

9151
04:00:26,699 --> 04:00:28,670
to just like pick her up
and bring her back that was not possible

9152
04:00:28,670 --> 04:00:28,680
and bring her back that was not possible
 

9153
04:00:28,680 --> 04:00:31,790
and bring her back that was not possible
in this situation and I also did not

9154
04:00:31,790 --> 04:00:31,800
in this situation and I also did not
 

9155
04:00:31,800 --> 04:00:34,490
in this situation and I also did not
want her to try to do the same thing

9156
04:00:34,490 --> 04:00:34,500
want her to try to do the same thing
 

9157
04:00:34,500 --> 04:00:37,490
want her to try to do the same thing
backwards to come back to me because it

9158
04:00:37,490 --> 04:00:37,500
backwards to come back to me because it
 

9159
04:00:37,500 --> 04:00:39,110
backwards to come back to me because it
just seemed too dangerous if she would

9160
04:00:39,110 --> 04:00:39,120
just seemed too dangerous if she would
 

9161
04:00:39,120 --> 04:00:41,809
just seemed too dangerous if she would
slip and fall

9162
04:00:41,809 --> 04:00:41,819
slip and fall
 

9163
04:00:41,819 --> 04:00:44,630
slip and fall
these are not good

9164
04:00:44,630 --> 04:00:44,640
these are not good
 

9165
04:00:44,640 --> 04:00:45,490

um

9166
04:00:45,490 --> 04:00:45,500
um
 

9167
04:00:45,500 --> 04:00:47,290
um
yeah

9168
04:00:47,290 --> 04:00:47,300

04:00:52,370 --> 04:00:52,380
I don't know
 

9173
04:00:52,380 --> 04:00:55,550
I don't know
if I would try to hold her and then I

9174
04:00:55,550 --> 04:00:55,560
if I would try to hold her and then I
 

9175
04:00:55,560 --> 04:00:57,650
if I would try to hold her and then I
make a little mistake while she is

9176

my mom

9308
04:03:33,729 --> 04:03:33,739
my mom
 

9309
04:03:33,739 --> 04:03:36,710
my mom
when she was living with a partner who

9310
04:03:36,710 --> 04:03:36,720
when she was living with a partner who

brought in some cats
 

9313
04:03:38,220 --> 04:03:40,550
brought in some cats
my mom was living in a apartment that

9314
04:03:40,550 --> 04:03:40,560
my mom was living in a apartment that
 

9315
04:03:40,560 --> 04:03:42,650
my mom was living in a apartment that
was like on the third floor so really

9316
04:03:42,650 --> 04:03:42,660
was like on the third floor so really
 

9317
04:03:42,660 --> 04:03:45,469
was like on the third floor so really
not very high at all and one of the cats

9318
04:03:45,469 --> 04:03:45,479
not very high at all and one of the cats
 

9319
04:03:45,479 --> 04:03:47,030
not very high at all and one of the cats
was you know

9320
04:03:47,030 --> 04:03:47,040
was you know
 

9321
04:03:47,040 --> 04:03:49,250
was you know
standing on the rail of the fence and

9322
04:03:49,250 --> 04:03:49,260
standing on the rail of the fence and
 

9323
04:03:49,260 --> 04:03:53,210
standing on the rail of the fence and
fell down and died pretty much instantly

9324
04:03:53,210 --> 04:03:53,220
fell down and died pretty much instantly
 

9325
04:03:53,220 --> 04:03:56,630
fell down and died pretty much instantly
so even if it's a low height if it lands

9326
04:03:56,630 --> 04:03:56,640
so even if it's a low height if it lands
 

9327
04:03:56,640 --> 04:04:00,110
so even if it's a low height if it lands
weirdly then it can die

9328
04:04:00,110 --> 04:04:00,120

 

9329
