1393
00:30:57,899 --> 00:30:59,570
hold on I'm gonna run it by you I want
but I'm not sure if I want to do it with

1394
00:30:59,570 --> 00:30:59,580
but I'm not sure if I want to do it with
 

1395
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:02,090
but I'm not sure if I want to do it with
livers or with the chat so let me know

1396
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:02,100
livers or with the chat so let me know

oh do you know bingo
 

1399
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:07,789
oh do you know bingo
yes so I can go so for example if I go

1400
00:31:07,789 --> 00:31:07,799
yes so I can go so for example if I go
 

1401
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,950

on a website I can create Bingo cards

1402
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:09,960
on a website I can create Bingo cards
 

1403
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,330
on a website I can create Bingo cards
and I was thinking maybe of doing them

1404
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:11,340
and I was thinking maybe of doing them
 

1405
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,130
and I was thinking maybe of doing them
with like different libraries and

1406
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:13,140
with like different libraries and
 

1407
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,630
with like different libraries and
different outfits because I think we're

1408
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:14,640
different outfits because I think we're
 

1409
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,850
different outfits because I think we're
30 livers and on a bingo card there's

1410
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:16,860
30 livers and on a bingo card there's
 

1411
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:19,130
30 livers and on a bingo card there's
24. so to randomize them I would add

1412
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:19,140
24. so to randomize them I would add
 

1413
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,529
24. so to randomize them I would add
other outfits and stuff like that and I

1414
00:31:21,529 --> 00:31:21,539
other outfits and stuff like that and I
 

1415
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:23,210
other outfits and stuff like that and I
would actually want to have my like

1416
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:23,220
would actually want to have my like
 

1417
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,130
would actually want to have my like
print them out the cards and you know

1418
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:25,140
print them out the cards and you know
 

1419
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:28,010
print them out the cards and you know
use the little marker what do you think

1420
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:28,020
use the little marker what do you think
 

1421
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,690
use the little marker what do you think
what would that

1422
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:29,700
what would that
 

1423
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:33,649
what would that
what would the game be so basically the

1424
00:31:33,649 --> 00:31:33,659
what would the game be so basically the
 

1425
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:36,049
what would the game be so basically the
way it works is I'll have a card right

1426
00:31:36,049 --> 00:31:36,059
way it works is I'll have a card right
 

1427
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:37,909
way it works is I'll have a card right
that's randomized of pictures and so

1428
00:31:37,909 --> 00:31:37,919
that's randomized of pictures and so
 

1429
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:39,950
that's randomized of pictures and so
with the audience and then you just pick

1430
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:39,960
with the audience and then you just pick
 

1431
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,310
with the audience and then you just pick
a b 24 like be a lira Pandora and then

1432
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:43,320
a b 24 like be a lira Pandora and then

reason why I put so much effort into
 

2369

reason why I put so much effort into
what I do into my content and so on is

2370
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:25,740
what I do into my content and so on is
 

2371
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:28,550
what I do into my content and so on is
because it's a once in a lifetime chance
