693
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,909
already the first free repeat then you
can go into end game what they repeat

694
00:28:18,909 --> 00:28:18,919
can go into end game what they repeat

know if I want to do that for for me I

700
00:28:28,549 --> 00:28:28,559
know if I want to do that for for me I
 

701
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,350
know if I want to do that for for me I
think it will be over after the first

702
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:31,360
think it will be over after the first
 

703
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:36,669

threee oh right that Diablo did that

704
00:28:36,669 --> 00:28:36,679
threee oh right that Diablo did that
 

705
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:39,070
threee oh right that Diablo did that
too wait why would they do that if they

706
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:39,080
too wait why would they do that if they
 

707
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:42,590
too wait why would they do that if they
don't even have the full

that's what I was thinking too so if we

712
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:48,720
that's what I was thinking too so if we
 

713
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,230
that's what I was thinking too so if we
think of only the first three without

714
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:52,240
think of only the first three without
 

715
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,549
think of only the first three without
redoing them in hard

716
00:28:55,549 --> 00:28:55,559
redoing them in hard
 

717
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:59,310
redoing them in hard
mode uh death it's doable in this and

718
00:28:59,310 --> 00:28:59,320

725
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,430

to think about that God damn it could be

726

plan out how long this stream should be
 

731
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,990
plan out how long this stream should be
and how long the next stream should be

732
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:20,000
and how long the next stream should be
 

733
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,549
and how long the next stream should be
when I should end it today so that the

734
00:29:21,549 --> 00:29:21,559
when I should end it today so that the
 

735
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:24,549
when I should end it today so that the
next stream is like a good length you

736

737
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:28,269

8197
04:45:32,360 --> 04:45:47,190

Titans ah for like the relics

8198
04:45:47,190 --> 04:45:47,200

 

8199
04:45:47,200 --> 04:45:49,750

we'll find a use

8200
04:45:49,750 --> 04:45:49,760
we'll find a use
 

8201
04:45:49,760 --> 04:45:55,510
we'll find a use
here they remain where they

8202
04:45:55,510 --> 04:45:55,520

 

8203
04:45:55,520 --> 04:45:57,868

slept

04:45:57,868 --> 04:45:57,878
slept
 

8205
04:45:57,878 --> 04:46:01,550
slept
well dying where you used to

8206
04:46:01,550 --> 04:46:01,560
well dying where you used to
 

8207
04:46:01,560 --> 04:46:05,030
well dying where you used to
sleep or where you're usually sleeping

8208
04:46:05,030 --> 04:46:05,040
sleep or where you're usually sleeping
 

8209
04:46:05,040 --> 04:46:09,910
sleep or where you're usually sleeping
seems rather peaceful

8211
04:46:09,920 --> 04:46:19,350

so I see nothing wrong with

8212
04:46:19,350 --> 04:46:19,360

 

8213
04:46:19,360 --> 04:46:23,910

that they seem more faster than

8214
04:46:23,910 --> 04:46:23,920

 

8215
04:46:23,920 --> 04:46:26,430

usual cuz the game doesn't tell you okay

8216
04:46:26,430 --> 04:46:26,440
usual cuz the game doesn't tell you okay
 

8217

cell together we will have several
 

8241
04:47:11,920 --> 04:47:13,948
cell together we will have several
thousands of brain cells that's

8242
04:47:13,948 --> 04:47:13,958
thousands of brain cells that's
 

8243
04:47:13,958 --> 04:47:15,910
thousands of brain cells that's
impressive you

8244

own and they think they're cool with
 

8255
04:47:30,638 --> 04:47:34,868
own and they think they're cool with
their normal amount of brain cells so

8256
04:47:34,868 --> 04:47:34,878
their normal amount of brain cells so
 

8257
04:47:34,878 --> 04:47:38,708
their normal amount of brain cells so
they don't think about the op thing of

8258
04:47:38,708 --> 04:47:38,718
they don't think about the op thing of
 

8259
04:47:38,718 --> 04:47:43,270
they don't think about the op thing of
collaborating your brain cells

8260
04:47:43,270 --> 04:47:43,280

 

8261
04:47:43,280 --> 04:47:47,788

and working

8262
04:47:47,788 --> 04:47:47,798

 

8263
04:47:47,798 --> 04:47:52,030

together and so they will never achieve

together and so they will never achieve
 

8265
04:47:52,040 --> 04:47:54,670
together and so they will never achieve
the greatness that we're

8266
04:47:54,670 --> 04:47:54,680
the greatness that we're
 

8267
04:47:54,680 --> 04:47:57,310
the greatness that we're
achieving if they combined all their

8268

achieving if they combined all their
 

8269
04:47:57,320 --> 04:47:59,788
achieving if they combined all their
brain cells they could have millions

8270
04:47:59,788 --> 04:47:59,798
brain cells they could have millions
 

8271
04:47:59,798 --> 04:48:01,788
brain cells they could have millions
yeah but we're they don't want to do

8272
04:48:01,788 --> 04:48:01,798
yeah but we're they don't want to do
 

8273

bug but we need each other so we combine
 

8281
04:48:17,040 --> 04:48:23,070
bug but we need each other so we combine
each other and then we are stronger than
