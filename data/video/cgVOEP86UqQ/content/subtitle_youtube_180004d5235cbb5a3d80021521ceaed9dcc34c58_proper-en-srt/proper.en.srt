​​​ ​She's so small!​ ​​

37
00:01:16,026 --> 00:01:20,364
​​​ ​She used to be a stray.​ ​​

38
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,364
​​​ ​A stray?!​ ​​

39
00:01:20,364 --> 00:01:24,134
​​​ ​Yeah! I just happened to find her in our garage​ ​​
​​ ​one day and I figured I'd just take her in.​ ​​

40
00:01:21,165 --> 00:01:23,300
​​​ ​Ah!​ ​​

46
00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:35,012
​​​ ​This cat's name is Cimol!​ ​​

47
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:38,215
​​​ ​It's the name of an Indonesian snack!​ ​​

​​​ ​A snack?​ ​​

50
00:01:38,215 --> 00:01:40,651
​​​ ​Yeah, it's a doughy snack.​ ​​

51
00:01:40,651 --> 00:01:42,519
​​​ ​Cimol is very lively.​ ​​

52
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,189
​​​ ​Also, she's a girl.​ ​​

53
00:01:43,387 --> 00:01:45,189
​​​ ​A girl!​ ​​

54

00:01:51,762 --> 00:01:53,363
​​​ ​So, about my cats...​ ​​

58
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,032

​​​ ​Chonkers​ ​​
​​ ​?? y/o​ ​​

60
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,032
​​​ ​They actually do have these colors.​ ​​

61
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:58,435
​​​ ​One of them has this​ ​​
​​ ​slightly greenish color.​ ​​

62
00:01:58,435 --> 00:02:00,471
​​​ ​She's really naughty​ ​​

63
00:01:58,435 --> 00:02:06,176
​​​ ​Smoothie​ ​​
​​ ​?? y/o​ ​​

64
00:02:00,471 --> 00:02:06,176
​​​ ​and lately has been giving me a lot of grief.​ ​​

65
00:02:06,176 --> 00:02:10,047
​​​ ​Chonkers​ ​​
​​ ​?? y/o​ ​​

66
00:02:06,176 --> 00:02:10,047
​​​ ​The other one who's orange​ ​​
​​ ​is called Chonkers.​ ​​

67
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:15,953
​​​ ​She's really nice and shy,​ ​​
​​ ​and she always comes to my side​ ​​

68
00:02:15,953 --> 00:02:19,490
​​​ ​even when I'm sick. She's a darling.​ ​​

69
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,692
​​​ ​What's in store for you girls today​ ​​

70
00:02:21,692 --> 00:02:24,428
​​​ ​is a quiz about cats!​ ​​

71
00:02:24,428 --> 00:02:26,830
​​​ ​Whoever answers correctly gets a chance​ ​​

72
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:31,068
​​​ ​to tell us a tale of their beloved cat!​ ​​

73
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:33,337
​​​ ​I wanna show my cats off!​ ​​

74
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:33,337
​​​ ​Let me show off my cats!​ ​​

75
00:02:33,337 --> 00:02:36,440
​​​ ​The person who gives us the​ ​​
​​ ​most stories about their beloved cats​ ​​

76
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,911
​​​ ​will be awarded with the​ ​​
​​ ​Queen of Cats title in hololive!​ ​​

77
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:43,213
​​​ ​That's the programme for today.​ ​​

78
00:02:43,213 --> 00:02:44,281
​​​ ​Meow! (Leave it to me!)​ ​​

79
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,281
​​​ ​Meow! (OK!)​ ​​

80
00:02:44,281 --> 00:02:44,781
​​​ ​Meow meow! (I'm in it to win it!)​ ​​

81
00:02:44,781 --> 00:02:46,383
​​​ ​Meow! (I have so much to say!)​ ​​

82
00:02:44,982 --> 00:02:46,383
​​​ ​Meow! (Ready to show off!)​ ​​

83
00:02:46,383 --> 00:02:48,185
​​​ ​I love cats!​ ​​

84
00:02:46,383 --> 00:02:48,185
​​​ ​Question #1​ ​​

85
00:02:48,185 --> 00:02:50,888
​​​ ​Here's the first Cat Quiz question!​ ​​

86
00:02:50,888 --> 00:02:54,625
​​​ ​When a cat blinks slowly,​ ​​
​​ ​what does it indicate?​ ​​

87
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:57,528
​​​ ​1) Trust​ ​​
​​ ​2) Intruder​ ​​

88
00:02:57,528 --> 00:03:01,265
​​​ ​3) Indifference​ ​​
​​ ​4) Annoyance​ ​​

89
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:02,266
​​​ ​Huh? You all know this, right?​ ​​

90
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:04,101
​​​ ​So for this question, we'll use​ ​​

91
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:06,370
​​​ ​the hand-raising format.​ ​​
​​ ​Who knows the answer?​ ​​

92
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:11,308
​​​ ​What's your answer, Fubuki-chan?​ ​​

93
00:03:11,308 --> 00:03:13,310
​​​ ​I pick #1!​ ​​

94
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,078
​​​ ​1) Indicating trust!​ ​​

95
00:03:15,078 --> 00:03:16,079
​​​ ​Surely.​ ​​

96
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:19,349
​​​ ​Fubuki-chan is correct, it's #1!​ ​​

97
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:22,286
​​​ ​Yay!​ ​​

98
00:03:19,383 --> 00:03:22,286
​​​ ​Cat-and-Tell​ ​​
​​ ​acquired!​ ​​

99
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:23,954
​​​ ​Wait, is this common knowledge?​ ​​

100
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:26,323
​​​ ​Yeah, it's common!​ ​​

101
00:03:25,255 --> 00:03:26,323
​​​ ​It is!​ ​​

102
00:03:26,323 --> 00:03:27,858
​​​ ​Everyone knows this.​ ​​

103
00:03:26,857 --> 00:03:27,858
​​​ ​O-Oh...​ ​​

104
00:03:27,858 --> 00:03:32,663
​​​ ​Let's hear a story from​ ​​
​​ ​our fastest answerer, Fubuki-san​ ​​

105
00:03:28,025 --> 00:03:32,663
​​​ ​Shirakami Fubuki's Cat-and-Tell!​ ​​

106
00:03:32,663 --> 00:03:36,867
​​​ ​Well, the cats who live under my roof​ ​​

107
00:03:36,867 --> 00:03:40,504
​​​ ​are both Somali cat breeds.​ ​​

108
00:03:40,504 --> 00:03:45,375
​​​ ​They were really vicious with​ ​​
​​ ​each other when they first met.​ ​​

109
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:51,181
​​​ ​Leo-kun took the initiative​ ​​
​​ ​and got close to Azu-kun​ ​​

110
00:03:51,181 --> 00:03:54,685
​​​ ​and started licking her fur!​ ​​

111
00:03:56,553 --> 00:04:01,592
​​​ ​And then! Azu-kun returned the favor​ ​​
​​ ​and started licking him back, too!​ ​​

112
00:04:01,592 --> 00:04:05,562
​​​ ​I got to witness a miracle!​ ​​

113
00:04:01,892 --> 00:04:06,563
​​​ ​Once foes, now friends​ ​​

114
00:04:05,562 --> 00:04:06,563
​​​ ​How nice!​ ​​

115
00:04:06,563 --> 00:04:09,466
​​​ ​And now they live endearingly together.​ ​​

116
00:04:09,466 --> 00:04:12,402
​​​ ​So, I also have two cats.​ ​​
​​ ​For a cat owner,​ ​​

117
00:04:12,402 --> 00:04:17,307
​​​ ​the moment that they both start​ ​​
​​ ​getting close to each other​ ​​

118
00:04:17,307 --> 00:04:21,712
​​​ ​is one that's hard to beat.​ ​​
​​ ​I certainly know how you feel.​ ​​

119
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,712
​​​ ​Nothing beats it!​ ​​

120
00:04:21,712 --> 00:04:24,081
​​​ ​I love cats!​ ​​

121
00:04:21,712 --> 00:04:24,081
​​​ ​Question #2​ ​​

122
00:04:24,081 --> 00:04:26,250
​​​ ​Here's the second question!​ ​​

123
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:32,322
​​​ ​Similar to fingerprints in humans, cats have an area that differs between every cat. Where?​ ​​

124
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:47,537
​​​ ​1. Nose​ ​​

125
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:47,537
​​​ ​2. Eyes​ ​​

126
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:47,537
​​​ ​3. Claws​ ​​

127
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:47,537
​​​ ​4. Paws​ ​​

128
00:04:32,322 --> 00:04:36,860
​​​ ​For this question, you'll all answer​ ​​
​​ ​with your whiteboards.​ ​​

129
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,195
​​​ ​Please write down your answers!​ ​​

130
00:04:39,296 --> 00:04:41,565
​​​ ​Let's take a look at everyone's answers!​ ​​

131
00:04:42,566 --> 00:04:47,537
​​​ ​Fubuki-san picked paws. Okayu-san also picked paws. Iofi-san, too, picked paws!​ ​​

132
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:48,572
​​​ ​There's so much to unpack!​ ​​

133
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:52,676
​​​ ​Rowdy Whiteboards​ ​​

134
00:04:49,339 --> 00:04:52,676
​​​ ​My screen is all over the place.​ ​​
​​ ​Reine-san picked the nose!​ ​​

135
00:04:52,676 --> 00:04:57,581
​​​ ​And Kiara-san also picked the nose.​ ​​
​​ ​It looks like we have a two group split!​ ​​

136
00:04:57,581 --> 00:05:02,185
​​​ ​A cat sweats through their paws,​ ​​

137
00:05:02,185 --> 00:05:05,322
​​​ ​and I was thinking that maybe​ ​​
​​ ​the amount they sweat differs,​ ​​

138
00:05:05,322 --> 00:05:09,693
​​​ ​or that the shape of their paws​ ​​
​​ ​often differs, so I picked paws.​ ​​

139
00:05:09,693 --> 00:05:13,930
​​​ ​Their nose's, uh... texture?​ ​​

140
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:17,234
​​​ ​They have those bumps, right?​ ​​

141
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,569
​​​ ​I thought that maybe​ ​​
​​ ​they differed like fingerprints.​ ​​

142
00:05:17,601 --> 00:05:20,570
​​​ ​Yeah!​ ​​

143
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,106
​​​ ​Whichever side could be correct, I wonder?​ ​​

144
00:05:23,106 --> 00:05:25,876
​​​ ​And the correct answer is...​ ​​

145
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,642
​​​ ​Please! Pretty pawlease!​ ​​

146
00:05:25,642 --> 00:05:26,710
​​​ ​Pretty pawlease!​ ​​

147
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:27,678
​​​ ​This one!​ ​​

148
00:05:28,278 --> 00:05:31,214
​​​ ​Yes!​ ​​

149
00:05:29,513 --> 00:05:31,214
​​​ ​The nose!​ ​​

150
00:05:31,214 --> 00:05:32,749
​​​ ​It was #1, huh!​ ​​

151
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:38,455
​​​ ​Only primates, like humans​ ​​
​​ ​and monkeys, have fingerprints.​ ​​

152
00:05:38,455 --> 00:05:43,427
​​​ ​As for the equivalent in cats—​ ​​
​​ ​like we just heard, the bumps on the nose​ ​​

153
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:47,931
​​​ ​differ in count between each cat, it seems!​ ​​

154
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:47,931
​​​ ​Yay!​ ​​

155
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:50,334
​​​ ​Since Reine-san and Kiara-san were correct,​ ​​

156
00:05:48,165 --> 00:05:50,334
​​​ ​Reine / Kiara: Correct​ ​​

157
00:05:50,334 --> 00:05:55,405
​​​ ​let's have the both of them​ ​​
​​ ​tell us a story about their cats!​ ​​

158
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:55,405
​​​ ​Cat-and-Tell​ ​​
​​ ​acquired!​ ​​

159
00:05:55,405 --> 00:05:58,675
​​​ ​So! I have a story about Cimol!​ ​​

160
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:58,675
​​​ ​Reine's Cat-and-Tell​ ​​

161
00:05:58,675 --> 00:06:03,413
​​​ ​She always picks up my drawing​ ​​
​​ ​tablet's pen with her mouth. Like a dog.​ ​​

162
00:06:03,413 --> 00:06:11,021
​​​ ​Walking while gnawing​ ​​
​​ ​on a pen like a dog​ ​​

163
00:06:03,814 --> 00:06:05,816
​​​ ​That's so cute!​ ​​

164
00:06:05,816 --> 00:06:08,885
​​​ ​Oh, a video!​ ​​

165
00:06:05,816 --> 00:06:08,885
​​​ ​She really likes rolling around.​ ​​

166
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:10,454
​​​ ​Cute!​ ​​

167
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:15,625
​​​ ​And I'm always left wondering​ ​​
​​ ​where my pen's gone.​ ​​

168
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,294
​​​ ​So she steals your pen!​ ​​

169
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,860
​​​ ​Yeah.​ ​​

170
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:18,028
​​​ ​Cuuute!​ ​​

171
00:06:18,028 --> 00:06:19,062
​​​ ​She steals it!​ ​​

172
00:06:19,062 --> 00:06:21,565
​​​ ​Does your cat like rolling around?​ ​​

173
00:06:19,062 --> 00:06:24,334
​​​ ​Absolutely loves rolling around​ ​​

174
00:06:21,565 --> 00:06:23,066
​​​ ​Yeah! She really loves to!​ ​​

175
00:06:23,066 --> 00:06:25,736
​​​ ​I have no idea what she's trying to do,​ ​​

176
00:06:25,736 --> 00:06:28,205
​​​ ​but she'll just start rolling and rolling...​ ​​

177
00:06:28,205 --> 00:06:30,240
​​​ ​I bet it feels super nice.​ ​​

178
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,075
​​​ ​Next up, Kiara-san!​ ​​

179
00:06:30,273 --> 00:06:32,075
​​​ ​Kiara's Cat-and-Tell​ ​​

180
00:06:30,907 --> 00:06:31,675
​​​ ​Okay!​ ​​

181
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:33,944
​​​ ​So whenever I bring this up,​ ​​

182
00:06:33,944 --> 00:06:36,613
​​​ ​everyone else starts freaking out​ ​​

183
00:06:36,613 --> 00:06:39,850
​​​ ​and saying stuff like,​ ​​
​​ ​"That's scary" or "That's creepy."​ ​​

184
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:42,486
​​​ ​So, up until recently,​ ​​

185
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:46,923
​​​ ​I was living in Japan a bit, right?​ ​​
​​ ​For about a year.​ ​​

186
00:06:46,923 --> 00:06:52,095
​​​ ​Having to leave my cats back home​ ​​
​​ ​got me feeling down in the dumps,​ ​​

187
00:06:52,095 --> 00:06:54,131
​​​ ​so I, um, decided to​ ​​

188
00:06:54,131 --> 00:06:58,268
​​​ ​cut off quite a bit of fur off my cats...​ ​​

189
00:06:58,635 --> 00:06:59,436
​​​ ​What?!​ ​​

190
00:06:59,936 --> 00:07:01,204
​​​ ​And then,​ ​​

191
00:07:01,204 --> 00:07:04,107
​​​ ​using some tape, I attached the fur​ ​​

192
00:07:04,107 --> 00:07:06,610
​​​ ​to the backs of some​ ​​
​​ ​cute photographs of my cats.​ ​​

193
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:14,284
​​​ ​Hesitant to leave her cats behind, decided to bring​ ​​
​​ ​some photos of her cats with her cats' fur attached​ ​​

194
00:07:06,977 --> 00:07:09,446
​​​ ​Oh I see! So they'd always "be" with you!​ ​​

195
00:07:09,446 --> 00:07:11,014
​​​ ​But that's kinda cute!​ ​​

196
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:15,986
​​​ ​Whenever I felt down while in Japan,​ ​​
​​ ​I'd take out those photos​ ​​

197
00:07:15,986 --> 00:07:19,122
​​​ ​to look at them and​ ​​
​​ ​"pet" the fur with my fingers,​ ​​

198
00:07:19,122 --> 00:07:23,994
​​​ ​and I'd feel a little happy​ ​​
​​ ​from that. That's how much​ ​​

199
00:07:23,994 --> 00:07:25,695
​​​ ​I can't live without being with my cats!​ ​​

200
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,963
​​​ ​So uh, thoughts?​ ​​

201
00:07:26,963 --> 00:07:31,401
​​​ ​Everyone else I've told this to​ ​​
​​ ​says it's creepy...​ ​​

202
00:07:29,933 --> 00:07:31,401
​​​ ​But I know how you feel!​ ​​

203
00:07:31,401 --> 00:07:34,671
​​​ ​CAT​ ​​

204
00:07:31,401 --> 00:07:35,305
​​​ ​Speaking as a cat,​ ​​
​​ ​I feel the adrenaline rush coming up.​ ​​

205
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:35,305
​​​ ​Really?​ ​​

206
00:07:35,305 --> 00:07:38,074
​​​ ​I love cats!​ ​​

207
00:07:35,305 --> 00:07:38,074
​​​ ​Question #3​ ​​

208
00:07:38,074 --> 00:07:38,809
​​​ ​Here's the third question!​ ​​

209
00:07:38,275 --> 00:07:48,185
​​​ ​1. Saltiness​ ​​

210
00:07:38,275 --> 00:07:48,185
​​​ ​2. Sourness​ ​​

211
00:07:38,275 --> 00:07:48,185
​​​ ​3. Sweetness​ ​​

212
00:07:38,275 --> 00:07:48,185
​​​ ​4. Spiciness​ ​​

213
00:07:38,809 --> 00:07:44,214
​​​ ​Which of the following​ ​​
​​ ​do cats lack taste buds for?​ ​​

214
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:44,214
​​​ ​Oh!​ ​​

215
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:48,185
​​​ ​We'll use the hand-raising format for this one.​ ​​
​​ ​Meow when you think you've got it!​ ​​

216
00:07:48,185 --> 00:07:48,718
​​​ ​Meow!​ ​​

217
00:07:48,185 --> 00:07:48,718
​​​ ​Meow!​ ​​

218
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,755
​​​ ​Nearly Simultaneous!​ ​​

219
00:07:49,152 --> 00:07:50,554
​​​ ​I know this one!​ ​​

220
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,755
​​​ ​Iofi-san, you know this?!​ ​​

221
00:07:51,755 --> 00:07:53,457
​​​ ​It's #3, sweetness.​ ​​

222
00:07:53,457 --> 00:07:54,658
​​​ ​Sweetness!​ ​​

223
00:07:54,658 --> 00:07:55,559
​​​ ​What about you, Iofi?​ ​​

224
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:56,460
​​​ ​Same answer.​ ​​

225
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,861
​​​ ​Iofi-san picks sweetness, too?​ ​​

226
00:07:57,861 --> 00:08:00,597
​​​ ​Are Reine-san and Iofi-san correct?​ ​​

227
00:08:00,597 --> 00:08:01,932
​​​ ​The correct answer is...​ ​​

228
00:08:01,932 --> 00:08:02,999
​​​ ​Sweetness! Sweetness!​ ​​

229
00:08:02,999 --> 00:08:06,536
​​​ ​Sweetness is correct!​ ​​

230
00:08:05,535 --> 00:08:10,340
​​​ ​Reine and Iofi: Correct​ ​​

231
00:08:05,535 --> 00:08:10,340
​​​ ​Yay!​ ​​

232
00:08:07,771 --> 00:08:10,340
​​​ ​Wow! You two sure were quick!​ ​​

233
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:14,110
​​​ ​Now then! Let's get to hearing​ ​​
​​ ​about both of your cats!​ ​​

00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:14,878
​​​ ​Iofi-san first!​ ​​

236
00:08:14,878 --> 00:08:18,081
​​​ ​My umm, it—this—er...​ ​​

237
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:20,884
​​​ ​She's sleeping on my lap here.​ ​​

238
00:08:20,884 --> 00:08:26,590
​​​ ​At first, since she's a stray and all,​ ​​
​​ ​I thought she'd be afraid of people.​ ​​

239
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:30,026
​​​ ​But nope. She sleeps​ ​​
​​ ​on my lap, even right now.​ ​​

240
00:08:30,026 --> 00:08:33,363
​​​ ​My daughter is absolutely adorable.​ ​​

241
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:32,863
​​​ ​Your daughter!​ ​​

242
00:08:33,363 --> 00:08:37,934
​​​ ​Let's hear some more stories,​ ​​
​​ ​this time from Reine-san!​ ​​

243
00:08:33,396 --> 00:08:37,934
​​​ ​Reine's Cat-and-Tell​ ​​

244
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,703
​​​ ​So I take care of two cats,​ ​​

245
00:08:39,703 --> 00:08:40,670
​​​ ​and, let's see...​ ​​

246
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,138
​​​ ​The other cat is fine,​ ​​

247
00:08:42,138 --> 00:08:45,208
​​​ ​it's just this one who's really noisy.​ ​​

248
00:08:42,138 --> 00:08:46,610
​​​ ​Cimol's the noisy one​ ​​

249
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:45,742
​​​ ​Noisy!​ ​​

250
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:49,846
​​​ ​Yeah! She'll always start meowing​ ​​
​​ ​outside my room!​ ​​

251
00:08:45,742 --> 00:08:47,511
​​​ ​The talkative type, huh!​ ​​

252
00:08:49,846 --> 00:08:51,481
​​​ ​And when I let her in,​ ​​

253
00:08:51,481 --> 00:08:53,817
​​​ ​she'll be here for one or two minutes​ ​​

254
00:08:53,817 --> 00:08:57,687
​​​ ​and start meowing again to​ ​​
​​ ​let her outside. It's an unending loop.​ ​​

255
00:08:57,687 --> 00:09:02,225
​​​ ​I really wish she'd decide​ ​​
​​ ​whether she wants to be inside or outside!​ ​​

256
00:08:57,687 --> 00:09:03,493
​​​ ​Still loves​ ​​
​​ ​that always noisy side of her​ ​​

257
00:09:03,493 --> 00:09:07,197
​​​ ​I'd love to come over​ ​​
​​ ​to your place, Reine-chan!​ ​​

258
00:09:06,196 --> 00:09:08,732
​​​ ​That would be nice, but...!​ ​​

​​​ ​And now for the next question!​ ​​

262
00:09:13,837 --> 00:09:19,976
​​​ ​How many months after birth​ ​​
​​ ​do cats establish food preferences?​ ​​

263
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:19,976
​​​ ​1. 1 month​ ​​

​​ ​Temari and Kojirou.​ ​​

302
00:10:34,684 --> 00:10:39,990
​​​ ​I bought one of those round​ ​​
​​ ​donut beds for them a while back,​ ​​

303
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:42,726

307
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:53,436

​​ ​they would take turns using it.​ ​​

308
00:10:53,436 --> 00:10:56,873
​​​ ​They ended up squeezing in together​ ​​

309
00:10:56,873 --> 00:11:01,144
​​​ ​and sleeping like a thick, hearty cat pot,​ ​​

310
00:11:01,144 --> 00:11:03,813
​​​ ​nestled up tightly until morning.​ ​​

311
