think so originally I think the example
would be P

1930
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:22,720
would be P
 

1931
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:27,349

more iron and it doesn't seem like we're

10536
04:53:43,070 --> 04:53:43,080
more iron and it doesn't seem like we're
 

10537
04:53:43,080 --> 04:53:45,510
more iron and it doesn't seem like we're
getting that much on its

04:53:45,510 --> 04:53:45,520
getting that much on its
 

10539
04:53:45,520 --> 04:53:48,708
getting that much on its
own so it's definitely worth looking

10540
04:53:48,708 --> 04:53:48,718
own so it's definitely worth looking
 

10541
04:53:48,718 --> 04:53:51,190

11465
05:17:56,280 --> 05:17:59,510

sometimes no no no so for 3D I saw it

11466
05:17:59,510 --> 05:17:59,520
sometimes no no no so for 3D I saw it
 

11467
05:17:59,520 --> 05:18:01,030

whatever it's not that noticeable in the
 

11471
05:18:02,878 --> 05:18:05,590
whatever it's not that noticeable in the
2D um and I don't think they can change

11472
05:18:05,590 --> 05:18:05,600
2D um and I don't think they can change
 

11473
05:18:05,600 --> 05:18:06,750
2D um and I don't think they can change
it

11474
05:18:06,750 --> 05:18:06,760
it
 

11475
05:18:06,760 --> 05:18:09,270
it
anyway uh and originally I would have

11476
05:18:09,270 --> 05:18:09,280
anyway uh and originally I would have
 

11477
05:18:09,280 --> 05:18:11,150
anyway uh and originally I would have

11478
05:18:11,150 --> 05:18:11,160
liked to have longer hair you know but
 

11479
05:18:11,160 --> 05:18:12,948
liked to have longer hair you know but
then in 3D they cut it and I was like

11480
05:18:12,948 --> 05:18:12,958
then in 3D they cut it and I was like
 

11481
05:18:12,958 --> 05:18:14,708
then in 3D they cut it and I was like
okay I guess that's how it is that's how

11482
05:18:14,708 --> 05:18:14,718
okay I guess that's how it is that's how

11486
05:18:17,430 --> 05:18:17,440
weird
 

11487
05:18:17,440 --> 05:18:20,310
weird
because like hook Papa Drew

11488
05:18:20,310 --> 05:18:20,320
because like hook Papa Drew
 

11489
05:18:20,320 --> 05:18:23,390
because like hook Papa Drew
it hook papa is the one who drew it in

11490
05:18:23,390 --> 05:18:23,400
it hook papa is the one who drew it in
 

11491
05:18:23,400 --> 05:18:25,868
it hook papa is the one who drew it in
both ways like I don't know what

11492
05:18:25,868 --> 05:18:25,878
both ways like I don't know what
 

11493
05:18:25,878 --> 05:18:27,230
both ways like I don't know what
happened

11494
05:18:27,230 --> 05:18:27,240
happened
 

11495
05:18:27,240 --> 05:18:32,190
happened
there um but then now in the 2.0 it's

11496
05:18:32,190 --> 05:18:32,200
there um but then now in the 2.0 it's
 

11497
05:18:32,200 --> 05:18:35,788
there um but then now in the 2.0 it's
still there and the thing is because the

11498
05:18:35,788 --> 05:18:35,798
still there and the thing is because the
 

11499
05:18:35,798 --> 05:18:38,868
still there and the thing is because the
rigging is so to say better the hair

11500
05:18:38,868 --> 05:18:38,878
rigging is so to say better the hair
 

11501
05:18:38,878 --> 05:18:42,310
rigging is so to say better the hair
moves even more and now I feel like that

11502
05:18:42,310 --> 05:18:42,320
moves even more and now I feel like that
 

11503
05:18:42,320 --> 05:18:45,470
moves even more and now I feel like that
shoulder length hair is more visible

11504
05:18:45,470 --> 05:18:45,480
shoulder length hair is more visible
 

11505
05:18:45,480 --> 05:18:48,510
shoulder length hair is more visible
than before and like shows up way more

11506
05:18:48,510 --> 05:18:48,520
than before and like shows up way more
 

11507
05:18:48,520 --> 05:18:49,910
than before and like shows up way more
like it's more noticeable you know what

11508
05:18:49,910 --> 05:18:49,920
like it's more noticeable you know what
 

11509
05:18:49,920 --> 05:18:52,510
like it's more noticeable you know what
I mean so I'm wondering is that going to

11510
05:18:52,510 --> 05:18:52,520
I mean so I'm wondering is that going to
 

11511
05:18:52,520 --> 05:18:56,510
I mean so I'm wondering is that going to
confuse people maybe now is the time to

11512
05:18:56,510 --> 05:18:56,520
confuse people maybe now is the time to
 

11513
05:18:56,520 --> 05:18:59,670
confuse people maybe now is the time to
remove it if possible uh and I asked and

11514
05:18:59,670 --> 05:18:59,680
remove it if possible uh and I asked and
 

11515
05:18:59,680 --> 05:19:01,110
remove it if possible uh and I asked and
I said no because it's not like a

11516
05:19:01,110 --> 05:19:01,120
I said no because it's not like a
 

11517
05:19:01,120 --> 05:19:03,350
I said no because it's not like a
ringing thing the the main art would

11518
05:19:03,350 --> 05:19:03,360
ringing thing the the main art would
 

11519
05:19:03,360 --> 05:19:06,110
ringing thing the the main art would
have to be changed I thought that maybe

11520
05:19:06,110 --> 05:19:06,120
have to be changed I thought that maybe
 

11521
05:19:06,120 --> 05:19:07,990
have to be changed I thought that maybe
you know all these things they're like

11522
05:19:07,990 --> 05:19:08,000
you know all these things they're like
 

11523
05:19:08,000 --> 05:19:11,590
you know all these things they're like
Single part right separate

11524
05:19:11,590 --> 05:19:11,600
Single part right separate
 

11525
05:19:11,600 --> 05:19:15,788
Single part right separate
parts so I think you could remove it but

11526
05:19:15,788 --> 05:19:15,798
parts so I think you could remove it but
 

11527
05:19:15,798 --> 05:19:18,868
parts so I think you could remove it but
it's like whatever right it's not that

11528
05:19:18,868 --> 05:19:18,878
it's like whatever right it's not that
 

11529
05:19:18,878 --> 05:19:20,350
it's like whatever right it's not that
important but it's something I noticed

11530
05:19:20,350 --> 05:19:20,360
important but it's something I noticed
 

11531
05:19:20,360 --> 05:19:24,788
important but it's something I noticed
where I was

11532
05:19:24,788 --> 05:19:24,798

 

11533
05:19:24,798 --> 05:19:29,150

like this has always been a thing

11534
05:19:29,150 --> 05:19:29,160
like this has always been a thing
 

11535
05:19:29,160 --> 05:19:33,270
like this has always been a thing
but cuz normally they do everything they

11536
05:19:33,270 --> 05:19:33,280
but cuz normally they do everything they
 

11537
05:19:33,280 --> 05:19:37,548
but cuz normally they do everything they
can to make the 3D accurate matching

11538
05:19:37,548 --> 05:19:37,558
can to make the 3D accurate matching
 

11539
05:19:37,558 --> 05:19:39,910
can to make the 3D accurate matching
accurately matching to to the 2D and

11540
05:19:39,910 --> 05:19:39,920
accurately matching to to the 2D and
 

11541
05:19:39,920 --> 05:19:42,270
accurately matching to to the 2D and
then for me for some reason that didn't

11542
05:19:42,270 --> 05:19:42,280
then for me for some reason that didn't
 

11543
05:19:42,280 --> 05:19:44,708
then for me for some reason that didn't
happen now I thought you you might want

11544
05:19:44,708 --> 05:19:44,718
happen now I thought you you might want
 

11545
05:19:44,718 --> 05:19:48,110
happen now I thought you you might want
it to match I was like well you guys do

11546
05:19:48,110 --> 05:19:48,120
it to match I was like well you guys do
 

11547
05:19:48,120 --> 05:19:49,910
it to match I was like well you guys do
you maybe want to match it up now

11548
05:19:49,910 --> 05:19:49,920
you maybe want to match it up now
 

11549
05:19:49,920 --> 05:19:51,910
you maybe want to match it up now
