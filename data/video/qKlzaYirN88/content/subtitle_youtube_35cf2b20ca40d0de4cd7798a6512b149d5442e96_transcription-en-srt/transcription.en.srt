but the question is just how do we lead
him over the arrow for a moment when

the C so maybe like goes like you want
me to press it press it maybe let's

5548
02:25:11,110 --> 02:25:11,120

 

5549
02:25:11,120 --> 02:25:15,309

see why oh no

5550

see why oh no
 

5551
02:25:15,319 --> 02:25:20,590
see why oh no
I okay let me let me just try one two to

5552
02:25:20,590 --> 02:25:20,600
I okay let me let me just try one two to
 

5553
02:25:20,600 --> 02:25:22,110
I okay let me let me just try one two to
Loop by a place

5554
02:25:22,110 --> 02:25:22,120
Loop by a place
 

5555
02:25:22,120 --> 02:25:26,349
Loop by a place
that oh up here over there no this needs

5556
02:25:26,349 --> 02:25:26,359
that oh up here over there no this needs
 

5557
02:25:26,359 --> 02:25:28,550
that oh up here over there no this needs
to go back

5558
02:25:28,550 --> 02:25:28,560
to go back
 

5559
02:25:28,560 --> 02:25:31,150
to go back
up oh wait you're right you're right

5560
02:25:31,150 --> 02:25:31,160
up oh wait you're right you're right
 

5561
02:25:31,160 --> 02:25:32,990
up oh wait you're right you're right
you're right you're right he needs to

5562
02:25:32,990 --> 02:25:33,000
you're right you're right he needs to
 

5563
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:35,389
you're right you're right he needs to
Loop multiple times he needs to go five

5564
02:25:35,389 --> 02:25:35,399
Loop multiple times he needs to go five
 

5565
02:25:35,399 --> 02:25:37,230
Loop multiple times he needs to go five
he needs to go over it five times so it

5566
02:25:37,230 --> 02:25:37,240
he needs to go over it five times so it
 

5567
02:25:37,240 --> 02:25:40,950
he needs to go over it five times so it
lights it all up cuz there's five lights

5568
02:25:40,950 --> 02:25:40,960
lights it all up cuz there's five lights
 

5569
02:25:40,960 --> 02:25:44,510
lights it all up cuz there's five lights
so I need to go over it five times and

5570
02:25:44,510 --> 02:25:44,520
so I need to go over it five times and
 

5571
02:25:44,520 --> 02:25:51,750
so I need to go over it five times and
then yeah that's what I mean

5572
02:25:51,750 --> 02:25:51,760

 

5573
02:25:51,760 --> 02:25:55,110

smart okay we can do that we can do that

5574
02:25:55,110 --> 02:25:55,120
smart okay we can do that we can do that
 

5575
02:25:55,120 --> 02:25:58,469
smart okay we can do that we can do that
which way we want to go this way it's be

5576
02:25:58,469 --> 02:25:58,479
which way we want to go this way it's be
 

5577
02:25:58,479 --> 02:26:01,910
which way we want to go this way it's be
like um we can just send them over the

5578
02:26:01,910 --> 02:26:01,920
like um we can just send them over the
 

5579
02:26:01,920 --> 02:26:04,190
like um we can just send them over the
same one several times right yeah you

5580
02:26:04,190 --> 02:26:04,200
same one several times right yeah you
 

5581
02:26:04,200 --> 02:26:08,550
same one several times right yeah you
have to make it oh I I think I found the

5582
02:26:08,550 --> 02:26:08,560
have to make it oh I I think I found the
 

5583
02:26:08,560 --> 02:26:12,269
have to make it oh I I think I found the
way wait isn't this like already a loop

5584
02:26:12,269 --> 02:26:12,279
way wait isn't this like already a loop
 

5585
02:26:12,279 --> 02:26:13,990
way wait isn't this like already a loop
yeah we pressed it so now it should be

5586
02:26:13,990 --> 02:26:14,000
yeah we pressed it so now it should be
 

5587
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,590
yeah we pressed it so now it should be
one does the same one not

5588
02:26:16,590 --> 02:26:16,600
one does the same one not
 

5589
02:26:16,600 --> 02:26:20,790
one does the same one not

the chest the secret chest so I

7750
03:21:30,429 --> 03:21:30,439
the chest the secret chest so I
 

7751
03:21:30,439 --> 03:21:33,750
the chest the secret chest so I
think that it is and I think now it

7752
03:21:33,750 --> 03:21:33,760
think that it is and I think now it
 

7753
03:21:33,760 --> 03:21:36,150
think that it is and I think now it
might be able to reach already yeah I

7754
03:21:36,150 --> 03:21:36,160
might be able to reach already yeah I
 

7755
03:21:36,160 --> 03:21:39,630
might be able to reach already yeah I
think it is uh you know how we climb up

7756
03:21:39,630 --> 03:21:39,640
think it is uh you know how we climb up
 

7757
03:21:39,640 --> 03:21:42,590
think it is uh you know how we climb up
this tree and we went like to the next

7758
03:21:42,590 --> 03:21:42,600
this tree and we went like to the next
 

7759
03:21:42,600 --> 03:21:45,349
this tree and we went like to the next
trees we want to go the opposite

7760
03:21:45,349 --> 03:21:45,359
trees we want to go the opposite
 

7761
03:21:45,359 --> 03:21:48,630
trees we want to go the opposite
direction oh because I've noticed that

7762
03:21:48,630 --> 03:21:48,640
direction oh because I've noticed that
 

7763
03:21:48,640 --> 03:21:52,429
direction oh because I've noticed that
the tree when fully grown reaches the

7764
03:21:52,429 --> 03:21:52,439
the tree when fully grown reaches the
 

7765
03:21:52,439 --> 03:21:55,030
the tree when fully grown reaches the
other side the other platform Which is

7766
03:21:55,030 --> 03:21:55,040
other side the other platform Which is
 

7767
03:21:55,040 --> 03:21:59,189
other side the other platform Which is
higher than where we originally went out

7768
03:21:59,189 --> 03:21:59,199
higher than where we originally went out
 

7769
03:21:59,199 --> 03:22:00,349
higher than where we originally went out
but it's hard to

7770
03:22:00,349 --> 03:22:00,359
but it's hard to
 

7771
03:22:00,359 --> 03:22:04,030
but it's hard to
climb yeah but don't don't go so don't

7772
03:22:04,030 --> 03:22:04,040
climb yeah but don't don't go so don't
 

7773
03:22:04,040 --> 03:22:05,750
climb yeah but don't don't go so don't
make the big jump if you're at the top

7774
03:22:05,750 --> 03:22:05,760
make the big jump if you're at the top
 

7775
03:22:05,760 --> 03:22:07,590
make the big jump if you're at the top
don't make the big jump I want to jump

7776
03:22:07,590 --> 03:22:07,600
don't make the big jump I want to jump

03:22:09,830 --> 03:22:09,840
together okay we jump together the way
 

7779
03:22:09,840 --> 03:22:11,550
together okay we jump together the way
I'll wait for

7780
03:22:11,550 --> 03:22:11,560
I'll wait for
 

7781
03:22:11,560 --> 03:22:14,070
I'll wait for
you but we got to find the right path

03:22:14,070 --> 03:22:14,080
you but we got to find the right path
 

7783
03:22:14,080 --> 03:22:18,429
you but we got to find the right path
this is difficult

7784
03:22:18,429 --> 03:22:18,439

 

7785
03:22:18,439 --> 03:22:22,229

huh Elizabeth we uh we uh you at the top
of the

7788
03:22:23,590 --> 03:22:23,600
of the
 

7789
03:22:23,600 --> 03:22:27,030
of the
tree oh let's try to get to the very top

7790
03:22:27,030 --> 03:22:27,040
tree oh let's try to get to the very top
 

7791
03:22:27,040 --> 03:22:29,349
tree oh let's try to get to the very top
of the tree because I think if yeah if

7792
03:22:29,349 --> 03:22:29,359
of the tree because I think if yeah if
 

7793
03:22:29,359 --> 03:22:32,870
of the tree because I think if yeah if
we jump yeah yeah because it reaches

7794
03:22:32,870 --> 03:22:32,880
we jump yeah yeah because it reaches
 

7795
03:22:32,880 --> 03:22:34,670
we jump yeah yeah because it reaches
just the perfect height you know and

7796
03:22:34,670 --> 03:22:34,680
just the perfect height you know and
 

7797
03:22:34,680 --> 03:22:36,510
just the perfect height you know and
that already looked suspicious to me

7798
03:22:36,510 --> 03:22:36,520
that already looked suspicious to me
 

7799
03:22:36,520 --> 03:22:38,550
that already looked suspicious to me
when I first one was in this dungeon and

7800
03:22:38,550 --> 03:22:38,560
when I first one was in this dungeon and
 

7801
03:22:38,560 --> 03:22:41,550
when I first one was in this dungeon and
my RPG senses were ting tingling yeah

7802
03:22:41,550 --> 03:22:41,560
my RPG senses were ting tingling yeah
 

7803
03:22:41,560 --> 03:22:44,189
my RPG senses were ting tingling yeah
but how do you jump from here well we

7804
03:22:44,189 --> 03:22:44,199
but how do you jump from here well we
 

7805
03:22:44,199 --> 03:22:46,469
but how do you jump from here well we
got to find a way it must be possible of

7806
03:22:46,469 --> 03:22:46,479
got to find a way it must be possible of
 

7807
03:22:46,479 --> 03:22:47,990
got to find a way it must be possible of
otherwise I don't think the tree would

7808
03:22:47,990 --> 03:22:48,000
otherwise I don't think the tree would
 

7809
03:22:48,000 --> 03:22:51,670
otherwise I don't think the tree would
like really grow this big pie do you

7810
03:22:51,670 --> 03:22:51,680
like really grow this big pie do you
 

7811
03:22:51,680 --> 03:22:53,550
like really grow this big pie do you
remember you made you cooked something

7812
03:22:53,550 --> 03:22:53,560
remember you made you cooked something
 

7813
03:22:53,560 --> 03:22:56,349
remember you made you cooked something
to make the jump higher can you make can

7814
03:22:56,349 --> 03:22:56,359
to make the jump higher can you make can
 

7815
03:22:56,359 --> 03:22:58,030
to make the jump higher can you make can
you can you give one to me as well I

7816
03:22:58,030 --> 03:22:58,040
you can you give one to me as well I
 

7817
03:22:58,040 --> 03:23:00,710
you can you give one to me as well I
want to try oh I would I would need I

7818
03:23:00,710 --> 03:23:00,720
want to try oh I would I would need I
 

7819
03:23:00,720 --> 03:23:02,670
want to try oh I would I would need I
already ate the first one and I don't

7820
03:23:02,670 --> 03:23:02,680
already ate the first one and I don't
 

7821
03:23:02,680 --> 03:23:03,990
already ate the first one and I don't
have any more I would need more

7822
03:23:03,990 --> 03:23:04,000
have any more I would need more
 

7823
03:23:04,000 --> 03:23:05,349
have any more I would need more
ingredients but I think we should be

7824
03:23:05,349 --> 03:23:05,359
ingredients but I think we should be
 

7825
03:23:05,359 --> 03:23:06,710
ingredients but I think we should be
able to do it without because honestly

7826
03:23:06,710 --> 03:23:06,720
able to do it without because honestly
 

7827
03:23:06,720 --> 03:23:09,389
able to do it without because honestly
the jump it didn't get much bigger it

7828
03:23:09,389 --> 03:23:09,399
the jump it didn't get much bigger it
 

7829
03:23:09,399 --> 03:23:12,150
the jump it didn't get much bigger it
was just like like 5

7830
03:23:12,150 --> 03:23:12,160
was just like like 5
 

7831
03:23:12,160 --> 03:23:14,950
was just like like 5
cm I don't know really small jump

7832
03:23:14,950 --> 03:23:14,960
cm I don't know really small jump
 

7833
03:23:14,960 --> 03:23:17,269
cm I don't know really small jump
possible from

7834
03:23:17,269 --> 03:23:17,279
possible from
 

7835
03:23:17,279 --> 03:23:21,309
possible from
yeah um there must be a different path I

7836
03:23:21,309 --> 03:23:21,319
yeah um there must be a different path I
 

7837
03:23:21,319 --> 03:23:27,150
yeah um there must be a different path I
guess a different path from other

7838
03:23:27,150 --> 03:23:27,160

 

7839
03:23:27,160 --> 03:23:30,830

side definitely not it or I wonder if it

7840
03:23:30,830 --> 03:23:30,840
side definitely not it or I wonder if it
 

7841
03:23:30,840 --> 03:23:34,830
side definitely not it or I wonder if it
can grow if this is the last stage of

7842
03:23:34,830 --> 03:23:34,840
can grow if this is the last stage of
 

7843
03:23:34,840 --> 03:23:38,349
can grow if this is the last stage of
the tree

7844
03:23:38,349 --> 03:23:38,359

 

7845
03:23:38,359 --> 03:23:41,510

Grove honestly I'm not even like 100%

7846
03:23:41,510 --> 03:23:41,520
Grove honestly I'm not even like 100%
 

7847
03:23:41,520 --> 03:23:43,990
Grove honestly I'm not even like 100%
sure about any of this of course

7848
03:23:43,990 --> 03:23:44,000
sure about any of this of course
 

7849
03:23:44,000 --> 03:23:47,309
sure about any of this of course
but I just had a feeling you know

7850
03:23:47,309 --> 03:23:47,319
but I just had a feeling you know
 

7851
03:23:47,319 --> 03:23:50,229
but I just had a feeling you know
huh yeah I mean we we here to explore

7852
03:23:50,229 --> 03:23:50,239
huh yeah I mean we we here to explore
 

7853
03:23:50,239 --> 03:23:53,590
huh yeah I mean we we here to explore
it's fine worst case we just go back

7854
03:23:53,590 --> 03:23:53,600
it's fine worst case we just go back
 

7855
03:23:53,600 --> 03:23:56,950
it's fine worst case we just go back
wait wait how did you oh how did you get

you go
 

7861
03:24:01,120 --> 03:24:03,950
you go
around here but I'm not really sure

7862
03:24:03,950 --> 03:24:03,960
around here but I'm not really sure
 

7863
03:24:03,960 --> 03:24:06,030
around here but I'm not really sure
where to go from here I don't think I

7864
03:24:06,030 --> 03:24:06,040
where to go from here I don't think I
 

7865
03:24:06,040 --> 03:24:08,550
where to go from here I don't think I
don't think it helps what I've

7866
03:24:08,550 --> 03:24:08,560
don't think it helps what I've
 

7867
03:24:08,560 --> 03:24:12,070
don't think it helps what I've
done yeah there's buttons here too which

7868
03:24:12,070 --> 03:24:12,080
done yeah there's buttons here too which
 

7869
03:24:12,080 --> 03:24:16,429
done yeah there's buttons here too which
some people say the buttons uh show like

7870
03:24:16,429 --> 03:24:16,439
some people say the buttons uh show like
 

7871
03:24:16,439 --> 03:24:20,510
some people say the buttons uh show like
the way to the next like jumpy platforms

7872
03:24:20,510 --> 03:24:20,520
the way to the next like jumpy platforms
 

7873
03:24:20,520 --> 03:24:22,910
the way to the next like jumpy platforms
but doesn't really because it show maybe

7874
03:24:22,910 --> 03:24:22,920
but doesn't really because it show maybe
 

7875
03:24:22,920 --> 03:24:25,830
but doesn't really because it show maybe
we do need a

7876
03:24:25,830 --> 03:24:25,840

 

7877
03:24:25,840 --> 03:24:28,790

potion I don't think so the potion okay

7878
03:24:28,790 --> 03:24:28,800
potion I don't think so the potion okay
 

7879
03:24:28,800 --> 03:24:31,550
potion I don't think so the potion okay
listen I try to jump but are you at the

7880
03:24:31,550 --> 03:24:31,560
listen I try to jump but are you at the
 

7881
03:24:31,560 --> 03:24:34,550
listen I try to jump but are you at the
bottom yeah can you try leading another

7882
03:24:34,550 --> 03:24:34,560
bottom yeah can you try leading another
 

7883
03:24:34,560 --> 03:24:37,229
bottom yeah can you try leading another
skeleton leading another G skeleton

7884
03:24:37,229 --> 03:24:37,239
skeleton leading another G skeleton
 

7885
03:24:37,239 --> 03:24:39,950
skeleton leading another G skeleton
there is no more skeletons oh so it is

7886
03:24:39,950 --> 03:24:39,960
there is no more skeletons oh so it is
 

7887
03:24:39,960 --> 03:24:44,429
there is no more skeletons oh so it is
the maximum okay interesting yeah and

7888
03:24:44,429 --> 03:24:44,439
the maximum okay interesting yeah and
 

7889
03:24:44,439 --> 03:24:47,070
the maximum okay interesting yeah and
let's see what if we may maybe the the

7890
03:24:47,070 --> 03:24:47,080
let's see what if we may maybe the the
 

7891
03:24:47,080 --> 03:24:49,189
let's see what if we may maybe the the
trees over there

7892
03:24:49,189 --> 03:24:49,199
trees over there
 

7893
03:24:49,199 --> 03:24:50,790
trees over there
connect

7894
03:24:50,790 --> 03:24:50,800
connect
 

7895
03:24:50,800 --> 03:24:55,030
connect
uh oh we can try uh growing those again

7896
03:24:55,030 --> 03:24:55,040
uh oh we can try uh growing those again
 

7897
03:24:55,040 --> 03:24:58,750
uh oh we can try uh growing those again
and see yeah if it maybe helps

7898
03:24:58,750 --> 03:24:58,760
and see yeah if it maybe helps
 

7899
03:24:58,760 --> 03:25:00,870
and see yeah if it maybe helps
us not sure because those would be

7900
03:25:00,870 --> 03:25:00,880
us not sure because those would be
 

7901
03:25:00,880 --> 03:25:03,790
us not sure because those would be
growing so far

7902
03:25:03,790 --> 03:25:03,800
growing so far
 

7903
03:25:03,800 --> 03:25:06,910
growing so far

members yesterday didn't grow them to

7906
03:25:08,870 --> 03:25:08,880
members yesterday didn't grow them to
 

7907
03:25:08,880 --> 03:25:13,189
members yesterday didn't grow them to
their fullest so oh let's do that then

7908
03:25:13,189 --> 03:25:13,199
their fullest so oh let's do that then
 

7909
03:25:13,199 --> 03:25:16,590
their fullest so oh let's do that then

7911
03:25:16,600 --> 03:25:19,189
no oh no no wait I think it's isn't
there is there a checkpoint there

7912
03:25:19,189 --> 03:25:19,199
there is there a checkpoint there
 

7913
03:25:19,199 --> 03:25:23,110
there is there a checkpoint there
too oh man I cannot oh yeah there is up

7914
03:25:23,110 --> 03:25:23,120
too oh man I cannot oh yeah there is up
 

7915
03:25:23,120 --> 03:25:26,870
too oh man I cannot oh yeah there is up
there oh it's not activating I'm stupid

7916
03:25:26,870 --> 03:25:26,880
there oh it's not activating I'm stupid
 

7917
03:25:26,880 --> 03:25:29,670
there oh it's not activating I'm stupid
what okay but I I'll start growing then

7918
03:25:29,670 --> 03:25:29,680
what okay but I I'll start growing then
 

7919
03:25:29,680 --> 03:25:34,229
what okay but I I'll start growing then
my party members

7920
03:25:34,229 --> 03:25:34,239

 

7921
03:25:34,239 --> 03:25:38,630

stupid what if it really

7922
03:25:38,630 --> 03:25:38,640

 

7923
03:25:38,640 --> 03:25:42,110

is okay one tree

7924
03:25:42,110 --> 03:25:42,120
is okay one tree
 

7925
03:25:42,120 --> 03:25:46,590
is okay one tree
Grove or what I if there's no more

7926
03:25:46,590 --> 03:25:46,600
Grove or what I if there's no more
 

7927
03:25:46,600 --> 03:25:48,030
Grove or what I if there's no more
skeletons down there I wonder can we Le

7928
03:25:48,030 --> 03:25:48,040
skeletons down there I wonder can we Le
 

7929
03:25:48,040 --> 03:25:51,070
skeletons down there I wonder can we Le
the skeleton down to the to tree that

7930
03:25:51,070 --> 03:25:51,080
the skeleton down to the to tree that
 

7931
03:25:51,080 --> 03:25:53,150
the skeleton down to the to tree that
we're growing and grow it even more just

7932
03:25:53,150 --> 03:25:53,160
we're growing and grow it even more just
 

7933
03:25:53,160 --> 03:25:55,189
we're growing and grow it even more just
a test because you're going to D you

7934
03:25:55,189 --> 03:25:55,199
a test because you're going to D you
 

7935
03:25:55,199 --> 03:25:56,349
a test because you're going to D you
going

7936
03:25:56,349 --> 03:25:56,359
going
 

7937
03:25:56,359 --> 03:26:01,389
going
to make fall damage a the fall for could

7938
03:26:01,389 --> 03:26:01,399
to make fall damage a the fall for could
 

7939
03:26:01,399 --> 03:26:02,790
to make fall damage a the fall for could
I guess

7940
03:26:02,790 --> 03:26:02,800
I guess
 

7941
03:26:02,800 --> 03:26:06,630
I guess
so but if we like can you uh Elizabeth

difficult I want to I want him to face
 

7961
03:26:30,920 --> 03:26:32,269
difficult I want to I want him to face
the tree and then I want to push him

7962
03:26:32,269 --> 03:26:32,279
the tree and then I want to push him
 

7963
03:26:32,279 --> 03:26:34,389
the tree and then I want to push him
down of the sword because then he falls

7964
03:26:34,389 --> 03:26:34,399
down of the sword because then he falls
 

7965
03:26:34,399 --> 03:26:36,710
down of the sword because then he falls
down with some momentum it might

7966
03:26:36,710 --> 03:26:36,720
down with some momentum it might
 

7967
03:26:36,720 --> 03:26:39,309
down with some momentum it might
actually yeah if we CL yeah it does it

7968
03:26:39,309 --> 03:26:39,319
actually yeah if we CL yeah it does it
 

7969
03:26:39,319 --> 03:26:43,990
actually yeah if we CL yeah it does it

7975
03:26:48,760 --> 03:26:51,389

oh I want to come come here come here

7976
03:26:51,389 --> 03:26:51,399
oh I want to come come here come here
 

7977
03:26:51,399 --> 03:26:53,590
oh I want to come come here come here
come here I come probably enough if we

7978
03:26:53,590 --> 03:26:53,600
come here I come probably enough if we
 

7979
03:26:53,600 --> 03:26:55,269
come here I come probably enough if we
just grow this tree and if it's

7980
03:26:55,269 --> 03:26:55,279
just grow this tree and if it's
 

7981
03:26:55,279 --> 03:26:57,150
just grow this tree and if it's
connecting or oh maybe we need all of

7982
03:26:57,150 --> 03:26:57,160
connecting or oh maybe we need all of
 

7983
03:26:57,160 --> 03:26:58,469
connecting or oh maybe we need all of
them cuz honestly it was really

7984
03:26:58,469 --> 03:26:58,479
them cuz honestly it was really
 

7985
03:26:58,479 --> 03:27:02,590
them cuz honestly it was really
complicated to get the other CD the V

7986
03:27:02,590 --> 03:27:02,600
complicated to get the other CD the V
 

7987
03:27:02,600 --> 03:27:05,070
complicated to get the other CD the V
vinyl yeah so maybe if we jump from One

7988
03:27:05,070 --> 03:27:05,080
vinyl yeah so maybe if we jump from One
 

7989
03:27:05,080 --> 03:27:06,870
vinyl yeah so maybe if we jump from One
Tree to the other tree to the other

7990
03:27:06,870 --> 03:27:06,880
Tree to the other tree to the other
 

7991
03:27:06,880 --> 03:27:13,309
Tree to the other tree to the other
tree You Know It All Connect over here

7992
03:27:13,309 --> 03:27:13,319

 

7993
03:27:13,319 --> 03:27:16,150

because oh oh you think that's uh it

7994
03:27:16,150 --> 03:27:16,160
because oh oh you think that's uh it
 

7995
03:27:16,160 --> 03:27:18,710
because oh oh you think that's uh it
finished growing this one uh I might

7996
03:27:18,710 --> 03:27:18,720
finished growing this one uh I might
 

7997
03:27:18,720 --> 03:27:21,590
finished growing this one uh I might
have wait where where connects though

7998
03:27:21,590 --> 03:27:21,600
have wait where where connects though
 

7999
03:27:21,600 --> 03:27:23,389
have wait where where connects though
are you sure at the top if you come over

8000
03:27:23,389 --> 03:27:23,399
are you sure at the top if you come over
 

8001
03:27:23,399 --> 03:27:25,309
are you sure at the top if you come over
to where we are you can see that the

8002
03:27:25,309 --> 03:27:25,319
to where we are you can see that the
 

8003
03:27:25,319 --> 03:27:27,189
to where we are you can see that the
tree is reaching out to the other tree

8004
03:27:27,189 --> 03:27:27,199
tree is reaching out to the other tree
 

8005
03:27:27,199 --> 03:27:29,670
tree is reaching out to the other tree
and you could probably make that

8006
03:27:29,670 --> 03:27:29,680
and you could probably make that
 

8007
03:27:29,680 --> 03:27:35,189
and you could probably make that
jump

8008
03:27:35,189 --> 03:27:35,199

 

8009
03:27:35,199 --> 03:27:38,070

before okay this one I probably from

8034
03:28:17,429 --> 03:28:17,439
before okay this one I probably from
 

8035
03:28:17,439 --> 03:28:25,510
before okay this one I probably from
this to this to there so this one has to

8036
03:28:25,510 --> 03:28:25,520

 

8037
03:28:25,520 --> 03:28:30,150

grown both trees to its fullest there's

8040
03:28:31,950 --> 03:28:31,960
grown both trees to its fullest there's
 

8041
03:28:31,960 --> 03:28:34,229
grown both trees to its fullest there's
no more skeletons spawning so I

8042
03:28:34,229 --> 03:28:34,239
no more skeletons spawning so I
 

8043
03:28:34,239 --> 03:28:37,150
no more skeletons spawning so I
think oh let me

think oh let me
see this from here to to jump on the

8046
03:28:41,349 --> 03:28:41,359
see this from here to to jump on the
 

8047
03:28:41,359 --> 03:28:42,750
see this from here to to jump on the
next

next
 

8049
03:28:42,760 --> 03:28:46,469
next
tree come over here no no I'm already on

tree come over here no no I'm already on
 

8051
03:28:46,479 --> 03:28:51,469
tree come over here no no I'm already on
the top which top never

8052
03:28:51,469 --> 03:28:51,479

 

8053
03:28:51,479 --> 03:28:55,269

with cats climbing trees yeah sometime

8056
03:28:58,990 --> 03:28:59,000
with cats climbing trees yeah sometime
 

8057
03:28:59,000 --> 03:29:01,309
with cats climbing trees yeah sometime
it happens you know you you get too

8058
03:29:01,309 --> 03:29:01,319
it happens you know you you get too
 

8059

stuck but cats always fall on their paws
 

8065
03:29:11,439 --> 03:29:14,910
stuck but cats always fall on their paws
supposedly sometime the other tree if

8066
03:29:14,910 --> 03:29:14,920
supposedly sometime the other tree if
 

8067
03:29:14,920 --> 03:29:17,630
supposedly sometime the other tree if
I'm e

8068
03:29:17,630 --> 03:29:17,640
I'm e
 

8069
03:29:17,640 --> 03:29:22,349
I'm e
it it feels like there's several

8070
03:29:22,349 --> 03:29:22,359

 

8071
03:29:22,359 --> 03:29:25,510

paths

8072
03:29:25,510 --> 03:29:25,520

 

8073
03:29:25,520 --> 03:29:29,110

oh you made it I'm almost there I feel

8074
03:29:29,110 --> 03:29:29,120
oh you made it I'm almost there I feel
 

8075
03:29:29,120 --> 03:29:32,030
oh you made it I'm almost there I feel
like

8076
03:29:32,030 --> 03:29:32,040
like
 

8077
03:29:32,040 --> 03:29:35,429
like
okay no it's still kind of far so I got

8078
03:29:35,429 --> 03:29:35,439
okay no it's still kind of far so I got
 

8079
03:29:35,439 --> 03:29:37,349
okay no it's still kind of far so I got
to go to the top and then fall

8080
03:29:37,349 --> 03:29:37,359
to go to the top and then fall
 

8081
03:29:37,359 --> 03:29:44,309
to go to the top and then fall
down

8082
03:29:44,309 --> 03:29:44,319

 

8083
03:29:44,319 --> 03:29:47,070

okay but this is not not quite it this

8084
03:29:47,070 --> 03:29:47,080
okay but this is not not quite it this
 

8085
03:29:47,080 --> 03:29:49,950
okay but this is not not quite it this
this is it I'm getting so excited I can

8086
03:29:49,950 --> 03:29:49,960
this is it I'm getting so excited I can
 

8087
03:29:49,960 --> 03:29:51,550
this is it I'm getting so excited I can
smell the

8088
03:29:51,550 --> 03:29:51,560
smell the
 

8089
03:29:51,560 --> 03:29:54,070
smell the
treasure I believe you can find it

8090
03:29:54,070 --> 03:29:54,080
treasure I believe you can find it
 

8091
03:29:54,080 --> 03:29:55,870
treasure I believe you can find it
what's the can you can you wait off to

8092
03:29:55,870 --> 03:29:55,880
what's the can you can you wait off to
 

8093
03:29:55,880 --> 03:30:00,349
what's the can you can you wait off to
open it yes I will wait if I find

8094
03:30:00,349 --> 03:30:00,359
open it yes I will wait if I find
 

8095
03:30:00,359 --> 03:30:04,990
open it yes I will wait if I find
it um wait I am I am confident you can

8096
03:30:04,990 --> 03:30:05,000
it um wait I am I am confident you can
 

8097
03:30:05,000 --> 03:30:06,750
it um wait I am I am confident you can
find I think there is like it makes

8098
03:30:06,750 --> 03:30:06,760
find I think there is like it makes
 

8099
03:30:06,760 --> 03:30:10,510
find I think there is like it makes
sense that there is one no 100% like I I

8100
03:30:10,510 --> 03:30:10,520
sense that there is one no 100% like I I
 

8101
03:30:10,520 --> 03:30:12,229
sense that there is one no 100% like I I
thought there was something there the

8102
03:30:12,229 --> 03:30:12,239
thought there was something there the
 

8103
03:30:12,239 --> 03:30:14,150
thought there was something there the
first time there's there's a reason why

8104
03:30:14,150 --> 03:30:14,160
first time there's there's a reason why
 

8105
03:30:14,160 --> 03:30:16,910
first time there's there's a reason why
these uh trees grow this tall and not

8106
03:30:16,910 --> 03:30:16,920
these uh trees grow this tall and not
 

8107
03:30:16,920 --> 03:30:18,670
these uh trees grow this tall and not
just as tall as we need

8108
03:30:18,670 --> 03:30:18,680
just as tall as we need
 

8109
03:30:18,680 --> 03:30:22,510
just as tall as we need
it for the noral path yeah now that we

8110
03:30:22,510 --> 03:30:22,520
it for the noral path yeah now that we
 

8111
03:30:22,520 --> 03:30:24,389
it for the noral path yeah now that we
have the vinyl from one dungeon we know

8112
03:30:24,389 --> 03:30:24,399
have the vinyl from one dungeon we know
 

8113
03:30:24,399 --> 03:30:27,269
have the vinyl from one dungeon we know
there must be a vinyl here

8114
03:30:27,269 --> 03:30:27,279
there must be a vinyl here
 

8115
03:30:27,279 --> 03:30:30,590
there must be a vinyl here
too but this is not this is too far

8116
03:30:30,590 --> 03:30:30,600
too but this is not this is too far
 

8117
03:30:30,600 --> 03:30:33,070
too but this is not this is too far
hello hi we need to go higher like it

8118
03:30:33,070 --> 03:30:33,080
hello hi we need to go higher like it
 

8119
03:30:33,080 --> 03:30:34,389
hello hi we need to go higher like it
looks like you can reach from here but

8120
03:30:34,389 --> 03:30:34,399
looks like you can reach from here but
 

8121
03:30:34,399 --> 03:30:36,229
looks like you can reach from here but
it's not quite enough we need to fall

8122
03:30:36,229 --> 03:30:36,239
it's not quite enough we need to fall
 

8123
03:30:36,239 --> 03:30:37,710
it's not quite enough we need to fall
from

8124
03:30:37,710 --> 03:30:37,720
from
 

8125
03:30:37,720 --> 03:30:41,309
from
higher so like we keep on jumping from

8126
03:30:41,309 --> 03:30:41,319
higher so like we keep on jumping from
 

8127
03:30:41,319 --> 03:30:43,630
higher so like we keep on jumping from
tree to tree no you can jump over here

8128
03:30:43,630 --> 03:30:43,640
tree to tree no you can jump over here
 

8129
03:30:43,640 --> 03:30:45,630
tree to tree no you can jump over here
no yeah but from there it's still too

8130
03:30:45,630 --> 03:30:45,640
no yeah but from there it's still too
 

8131
03:30:45,640 --> 03:30:48,429
no yeah but from there it's still too
far I think the other tree we have to go

8132

the other dungeon after all and it was
 

9527
04:07:53,520 --> 04:07:58,790
the other dungeon after all and it was
exactly where I thought it would

9528
04:07:58,790 --> 04:07:58,800

 

9529
04:07:58,800 --> 04:08:02,790

satisfying so satisfying and I had a
 

9533
04:08:05,560 --> 04:08:07,590
satisfying so satisfying and I had a
moment of Doubt when the tree the the

9534
04:08:07,590 --> 04:08:07,600
moment of Doubt when the tree the the
 

9535
04:08:07,600 --> 04:08:10,269
moment of Doubt when the tree the the
one tree the one that's closest to it

9536
04:08:10,269 --> 04:08:10,279
one tree the one that's closest to it
 

9537
04:08:10,279 --> 04:08:11,990
one tree the one that's closest to it
when there was just no path to get

9538
04:08:11,990 --> 04:08:12,000
when there was just no path to get
 

9539
04:08:12,000 --> 04:08:13,670
when there was just no path to get
higher

9540
04:08:13,670 --> 04:08:13,680
higher
 

9541
04:08:13,680 --> 04:08:16,269
higher
yeah but then Elizabeth thought that

9542
04:08:16,269 --> 04:08:16,279
yeah but then Elizabeth thought that
 

9543
04:08:16,279 --> 04:08:18,870
yeah but then Elizabeth thought that
maybe we got to grow the other trees and

9544
04:08:18,870 --> 04:08:18,880
maybe we got to grow the other trees and
 

9545
04:08:18,880 --> 04:08:23,790
maybe we got to grow the other trees and
then they ended up

9563
04:08:51,399 --> 04:08:53,189

my RPG senses are telling me but then I

9566
04:08:56,870 --> 04:08:56,880
my RPG senses are telling me but then I
 

9567
04:08:56,880 --> 04:09:00,149
my RPG senses are telling me but then I
lost my confidence when they all already

9568
04:09:00,149 --> 04:09:00,159
lost my confidence when they all already
 

9569
04:09:00,159 --> 04:09:03,229
lost my confidence when they all already
went ahead uh and I I was stuck in the

9570
04:09:03,229 --> 04:09:03,239
went ahead uh and I I was stuck in the
 

9571
04:09:03,239 --> 04:09:07,149
went ahead uh and I I was stuck in the
tree not finding the right

9572
04:09:07,149 --> 04:09:07,159
tree not finding the right
 

9573
04:09:07,159 --> 04:09:10,590
tree not finding the right
way that that got rid of my

9574
04:09:10,590 --> 04:09:10,600
way that that got rid of my
 

9575
04:09:10,600 --> 04:09:12,750
way that that got rid of my
confidence but I I I thought there's

9576
04:09:12,750 --> 04:09:12,760
confidence but I I I thought there's
 

9577
04:09:12,760 --> 04:09:14,710
confidence but I I I thought there's
something there there's there must be a

9578
04:09:14,710 --> 04:09:14,720
something there there's there must be a
 

9579
04:09:14,720 --> 04:09:19,510
something there there's there must be a
reason why that tree is so high H sus

9580
04:09:19,510 --> 04:09:19,520
reason why that tree is so high H sus
 

9581
04:09:19,520 --> 04:09:23,309
reason why that tree is so high H sus
very sus cuz it reached the exact height

9582
04:09:23,309 --> 04:09:23,319
very sus cuz it reached the exact height
 

9583
04:09:23,319 --> 04:09:27,149
very sus cuz it reached the exact height
of um the the platform on the other

9584
04:09:27,149 --> 04:09:27,159
of um the the platform on the other
 

9585
04:09:27,159 --> 04:09:30,189
of um the the platform on the other
side and all that height was unused and

9586
04:09:30,189 --> 04:09:30,199
side and all that height was unused and
 

9587
04:09:30,199 --> 04:09:32,590
side and all that height was unused and
if there's a maximum of of height that

9588
04:09:32,590 --> 04:09:32,600
if there's a maximum of of height that
 

9589
04:09:32,600 --> 04:09:34,710
if there's a maximum of of height that
the tree can reach then why would it not

9590
04:09:34,710 --> 04:09:34,720
the tree can reach then why would it not
 

9591
04:09:34,720 --> 04:09:38,870
the tree can reach then why would it not
be lower just so that you can go move on

9592
04:09:38,870 --> 04:09:38,880
be lower just so that you can go move on
 

9593
04:09:38,880 --> 04:09:41,149
be lower just so that you can go move on
to the other direction n there's a

9594
04:09:41,149 --> 04:09:41,159
to the other direction n there's a
 

9595
04:09:41,159 --> 04:09:43,910
to the other direction n there's a
