10161
04:42:40,160 --> 04:42:43,270
allowed sad another reason why I need my
own kind of like fry idle outfit that I

10162
04:42:43,270 --> 04:42:43,280
own kind of like fry idle outfit that I
 

10163
04:42:43,280 --> 04:42:44,948
own kind of like fry idle outfit that I
can play around

10164
04:42:44,948 --> 04:42:44,958
can play around
 

10165
04:42:44,958 --> 04:42:49,070
can play around
with but I was thinking it might be a

10166
04:42:49,070 --> 04:42:49,080
with but I was thinking it might be a
 

10167
04:42:49,080 --> 04:42:53,070
with but I was thinking it might be a
pretty like pretty expensive Endeavor

10168
04:42:53,070 --> 04:42:53,080
pretty like pretty expensive Endeavor
 

10169
04:42:53,080 --> 04:42:57,310
pretty like pretty expensive Endeavor
but I I I think I'm allowed to just

10170
04:42:57,310 --> 04:42:57,320
but I I I think I'm allowed to just
 

10171
04:42:57,320 --> 04:42:59,030
but I I I think I'm allowed to just
commission my own 3D model if it's for

10172
04:42:59,030 --> 04:42:59,040
commission my own 3D model if it's for
 

10173
04:42:59,040 --> 04:43:01,830
commission my own 3D model if it's for
mvs I might only be able to use it for

10174
04:43:01,830 --> 04:43:01,840
mvs I might only be able to use it for
 

10175
04:43:01,840 --> 04:43:03,830
mvs I might only be able to use it for
that kind of stuff I can't like I

10176
04:43:03,830 --> 04:43:03,840
that kind of stuff I can't like I
 

10177
04:43:03,840 --> 04:43:05,390
that kind of stuff I can't like I
probably wouldn't be able to use it for

10178
04:43:05,390 --> 04:43:05,400
probably wouldn't be able to use it for
 

10179
04:43:05,400 --> 04:43:09,230
probably wouldn't be able to use it for
like 3D lives definitely not actually

10180
04:43:09,230 --> 04:43:09,240
like 3D lives definitely not actually
 

10181
04:43:09,240 --> 04:43:12,110
like 3D lives definitely not actually
but the same way I made

10182
04:43:12,110 --> 04:43:12,120
but the same way I made
 

10183
04:43:12,120 --> 04:43:16,310
but the same way I made
I got preu models made right um in the

10184
04:43:16,310 --> 04:43:16,320
I got preu models made right um in the
 

10185
04:43:16,320 --> 04:43:19,310
I got preu models made right um in the
same way I should be allowed

10186
04:43:19,310 --> 04:43:19,320
same way I should be allowed
 

10187
04:43:19,320 --> 04:43:22,868
same way I should be allowed
to I think if it's just like for mvs and

10188
04:43:22,868 --> 04:43:22,878
to I think if it's just like for mvs and
 

10189
04:43:22,878 --> 04:43:23,420
to I think if it's just like for mvs and
so

10190
04:43:23,420 --> 04:43:23,430
so
 

10191
04:43:23,430 --> 04:43:25,670
so

on like if I can just get one that's

10194
04:43:28,350 --> 04:43:28,360
on like if I can just get one that's
 

10195
04:43:28,360 --> 04:43:30,948
on like if I can just get one that's
like somewhat versatile that would help

10196
04:43:30,948 --> 04:43:30,958
like somewhat versatile that would help
 

10197
04:43:30,958 --> 04:43:32,628
like somewhat versatile that would help
but I'm still like kind of like

10198
04:43:32,628 --> 04:43:32,638
but I'm still like kind of like
 

10199
04:43:32,638 --> 04:43:34,390
but I'm still like kind of like
insisting I

04:43:43,868 --> 04:43:43,878
MV on his own are already expensive and
 

10207
04:43:43,878 --> 04:43:46,310
MV on his own are already expensive and
I just wish I could get one through

10208
04:43:46,310 --> 04:43:46,320
I just wish I could get one through
 

10209
04:43:46,320 --> 04:43:48,430
I just wish I could get one through
normal measures within

10210
04:43:48,430 --> 04:43:48,440
normal measures within
 

10211
04:43:48,440 --> 04:43:51,910

concert which is not happening ever
seemingly for me like a solo IRL

10218
04:44:01,868 --> 04:44:01,878
seemingly for me like a solo IRL
 

10219
04:44:01,878 --> 04:44:04,310
seemingly for me like a solo IRL
concert um and the 1 million wish I

04:44:04,310 --> 04:44:04,320
concert um and the 1 million wish I
 

10221
04:44:04,320 --> 04:44:05,990

04:44:07,788 --> 04:44:07,798
asking like okay guys I didn't know this
 

10225
04:44:07,798 --> 04:44:10,030
asking like okay guys I didn't know this
was even possible to get a 3D outfit

10226
04:44:10,030 --> 04:44:10,040
was even possible to get a 3D outfit
 

10227
04:44:10,040 --> 04:44:11,990
was even possible to get a 3D outfit
back then so that's I didn't ask way and

10228
04:44:11,990 --> 04:44:12,000
back then so that's I didn't ask way and
 

10229
04:44:12,000 --> 04:44:13,628
back then so that's I didn't ask way and
you guys didn't give me a list of things

10230
04:44:13,628 --> 04:44:13,638
you guys didn't give me a list of things
 

10231
04:44:13,638 --> 04:44:15,270
you guys didn't give me a list of things
I could do either I just assumed it

10232
04:44:15,270 --> 04:44:15,280
I could do either I just assumed it
 

10233
04:44:15,280 --> 04:44:16,910
I could do either I just assumed it
would be too expensive to ask for that

10234
04:44:16,910 --> 04:44:16,920
would be too expensive to ask for that
 

10235
04:44:16,920 --> 04:44:19,110
would be too expensive to ask for that
and back then I I don't think I had any

10236
04:44:19,110 --> 04:44:19,120
and back then I I don't think I had any
 

10237
04:44:19,120 --> 04:44:21,030
and back then I I don't think I had any
references of somebody doing that before

10238
04:44:21,030 --> 04:44:21,040
references of somebody doing that before
 

10239
04:44:21,040 --> 04:44:23,510
references of somebody doing that before
me like maybe simultaneously people were

10240
04:44:23,510 --> 04:44:23,520
me like maybe simultaneously people were
 

10241
04:44:23,520 --> 04:44:25,670
me like maybe simultaneously people were
working on it uh in the background but

10242
04:44:25,670 --> 04:44:25,680
working on it uh in the background but
 

10243
04:44:25,680 --> 04:44:28,708
working on it uh in the background but
nobody had uh used a 3D wish for a 1

10244
04:44:28,708 --> 04:44:28,718
nobody had uh used a 3D wish for a 1
 

10245
04:44:28,718 --> 04:44:32,150
nobody had uh used a 3D wish for a 1
million uh for a 3D outfit yet at that

10246
04:44:32,150 --> 04:44:32,160
million uh for a 3D outfit yet at that
 

10247
04:44:32,160 --> 04:44:34,990
million uh for a 3D outfit yet at that
point I think so I just didn't

10248
04:44:34,990 --> 04:44:35,000
point I think so I just didn't
 

10249
04:44:35,000 --> 04:44:37,628
point I think so I just didn't
know oh can I like in hind side please

04:44:37,628 --> 04:44:37,638
know oh can I like in hind side please
 

10251
04:44:37,638 --> 04:44:39,310
know oh can I like in hind side please
