3583
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:38,870
ones but
it doesn't really tell us what it does

3584
01:39:38,870 --> 01:39:38,880

 

3585
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:41,990

okay you you might want to use this only

3590
01:39:48,470 --> 01:39:48,480
okay you you might want to use this only
 

3591
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:50,229
okay you you might want to use this only
when you're dead and you're walking up

3592
01:39:50,229 --> 01:39:50,239
when you're dead and you're walking up
 

3593
01:39:50,239 --> 01:39:52,229
when you're dead and you're walking up
to your dead body

3594
01:39:52,229 --> 01:39:52,239
to your dead body
 

3595
01:39:52,239 --> 01:39:53,270
to your dead body

3596
01:39:53,270 --> 01:39:53,280
so
 

3597
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:54,870
so
switch it out

3598
01:39:54,870 --> 01:39:54,880
switch it out
 

3599
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:56,950
switch it out
at those times so now it's kind of

3600
01:39:56,950 --> 01:39:56,960
at those times so now it's kind of
 

3601
01:39:56,960 --> 01:39:59,360
at those times so now it's kind of
unnecessary

3602
01:39:59,360 --> 01:39:59,370
