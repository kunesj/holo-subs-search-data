and
it is

1164
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:23,240
it is
 

1165
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,149

3218
01:18:26,159 --> 01:18:29,090

and thus we will reach the shrine easily

3219
01:18:29,090 --> 01:18:29,100
and thus we will reach the shrine easily
 

3220
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:32,450
and thus we will reach the shrine easily
where where does it actually go oh does

3250
01:19:23,699 --> 01:19:27,830

with this one we could reach an island

3251
01:19:27,830 --> 01:19:27,840
with this one we could reach an island
 

3252
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:32,810
with this one we could reach an island
okay

3253
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:32,820

 

3254
01:19:32,820 --> 01:19:37,630

3256
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:39,770

it's not the one that I already did

3257
01:19:39,770 --> 01:19:39,780
it's not the one that I already did
 

3258
01:19:39,780 --> 01:19:46,130
it's not the one that I already did
though right

3259
01:19:46,130 --> 01:19:46,140

 

3260
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:51,830

there

3261
01:19:51,830 --> 01:19:51,840

 

3262
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:55,070

the one I already did look I'm somewhere

3263
01:19:55,070 --> 01:19:55,080
the one I already did look I'm somewhere
 

3264
01:19:55,080 --> 01:20:06,229
the one I already did look I'm somewhere
else I think ow

3265
01:20:06,229 --> 01:20:06,239

 

3266
01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:11,689

oh there is ah I see the stone oh

3267
01:20:11,689 --> 01:20:11,699
oh there is ah I see the stone oh
 

3268
01:20:11,699 --> 01:20:14,750
oh there is ah I see the stone oh
they all look like that no

3269
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:14,760
they all look like that no
 

3270
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:17,510
they all look like that no
if if you activate the stone before the

3271
01:20:17,510 --> 01:20:17,520
if if you activate the stone before the
 

3272
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:20,450
if if you activate the stone before the
shrine uh I think it still works the

3273
01:20:20,450 --> 01:20:20,460
shrine uh I think it still works the
 

3274
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:22,370
shrine uh I think it still works the
same way it just tells you where the

3275
01:20:22,370 --> 01:20:22,380
same way it just tells you where the
 

3276
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:23,630
same way it just tells you where the
shrine is

3277
01:20:23,630 --> 01:20:23,640
shrine is
 

3278
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:25,370
shrine is
instead of the shrine telling you where

3279
01:20:25,370 --> 01:20:25,380
instead of the shrine telling you where
 

3280
01:20:25,380 --> 01:20:28,570
instead of the shrine telling you where
the stone is

3281
01:20:28,570 --> 01:20:28,580

 

3282
01:20:28,580 --> 01:20:32,689

off of the crystal there do so now offer
 

3288
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:38,930
off of the crystal there do so now offer
you Glide that vanishes evil

01:20:45,130 --> 01:20:45,140
sometimes they're quite difficult
 

3294
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:47,630
sometimes they're quite difficult
but we'll see

3295
01:20:47,630 --> 01:20:47,640
but we'll see
 

3296
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:50,930
but we'll see
where is it is it higher or is it lower

3297
01:20:50,930 --> 01:20:50,940
where is it is it higher or is it lower
 

3298
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:55,330
where is it is it higher or is it lower
because we have some stuff here

3299
01:20:55,330 --> 01:20:55,340

 

3300
01:20:55,340 --> 01:20:58,010

a glider too
 

3304
01:21:00,199 --> 01:21:04,070
a glider too
I just try to see

3305
01:21:04,070 --> 01:21:04,080
I just try to see
 

3306
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:06,530
I just try to see
where it actually is

3307
01:21:06,530 --> 01:21:06,540
where it actually is
 

3308
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:09,770

over there
yeah yeah that shouldn't be too

3313
01:21:13,010 --> 01:21:13,020
yeah yeah that shouldn't be too
 

3314
01:21:13,020 --> 01:21:14,689
yeah yeah that shouldn't be too
difficult should we take the glider or

3315
01:21:14,689 --> 01:21:14,699
difficult should we take the glider or
 

3316
01:21:14,699 --> 01:21:18,169
difficult should we take the glider or
should we take this

3317
01:21:18,169 --> 01:21:18,179

 

3318
01:21:18,179 --> 01:21:19,870

a glider right

3319
01:21:19,870 --> 01:21:19,880
a glider right
 

3320
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:28,270
a glider right
it should be a glider

3321
01:21:28,270 --> 01:21:28,280

 

3322
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:32,169

fall down yeah

3323
01:21:32,169 --> 01:21:32,179

 

3324
01:21:32,179 --> 01:21:34,790

and we're already

3325
01:21:34,790 --> 01:21:34,800
and we're already
 

3326
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:38,470
and we're already
put it in the right direction

3327
01:21:38,470 --> 01:21:38,480

 

3328
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:41,590

so we don't have to do much

3329
01:21:41,590 --> 01:21:41,600
so we don't have to do much
 

3330
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:45,610
so we don't have to do much
uh adjusting once we're floating

3331
01:21:45,610 --> 01:21:45,620
uh adjusting once we're floating
 

3332
01:21:45,620 --> 01:21:49,430
uh adjusting once we're floating

what no no ah glider slider on top of

3337
01:21:55,070 --> 01:21:55,080
what no no ah glider slider on top of
 

3338
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:58,270
what no no ah glider slider on top of
the car

3339

3340
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:02,030

or or cards on top of glider that would

3341
01:22:02,030 --> 01:22:02,040
or or cards on top of glider that would
 

3342
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:03,709
or or cards on top of glider that would
make no sense to me at least with the

3343
01:22:03,709 --> 01:22:03,719
make no sense to me at least with the
 

3344
01:22:03,719 --> 01:22:06,950
make no sense to me at least with the
with it on the bottom we could

3345
01:22:06,950 --> 01:22:06,960
with it on the bottom we could
 

3346
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:14,930
with it on the bottom we could
um roll off the cliff I guess

3347
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:14,940

 

3348
01:22:14,940 --> 01:22:17,110

like this

3349
01:22:17,110 --> 01:22:17,120
like this
 

3350
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:29,209
like this
but I touched the kind of shitty

3351
01:22:29,209 --> 01:22:29,219

 

3352
01:22:29,219 --> 01:22:31,130

I wish I didn't have to wiggle to do

3353
01:22:31,130 --> 01:22:31,140
I wish I didn't have to wiggle to do
 

3354
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:33,050
I wish I didn't have to wiggle to do
this because sometimes it messes up the

3355
01:22:33,050 --> 01:22:33,060
this because sometimes it messes up the
 

3356
01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:35,450
this because sometimes it messes up the
positioning that I already put so much

3357
01:22:35,450 --> 01:22:35,460
positioning that I already put so much
 

3358
01:22:35,460 --> 01:22:41,330
positioning that I already put so much
work into

3359
01:22:41,330 --> 01:22:41,340

 

3360
01:22:41,340 --> 01:22:44,870

wish it was just a button

3361
01:22:44,870 --> 01:22:44,880

 

3362
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:49,250

um okay should we use everything

3363
01:22:49,250 --> 01:22:49,260
um okay should we use everything
 

3364
01:22:49,260 --> 01:22:54,950
um okay should we use everything
you can shake the controller too oh

3365
01:22:54,950 --> 01:22:54,960

 

3366
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:58,130

quick I finally found the leather of my

7281
03:01:30,349 --> 03:01:30,359
quick I finally found the leather of my
 

7282
03:01:30,359 --> 03:01:32,510
quick I finally found the leather of my
great grandpa left but I can't reach it

7283
03:01:32,510 --> 03:01:32,520
great grandpa left but I can't reach it
 

7284
03:01:32,520 --> 03:01:35,150
great grandpa left but I can't reach it
my arms are too short okay that thing is

7285
03:01:35,150 --> 03:01:35,160
my arms are too short okay that thing is
 

7286
03:01:35,160 --> 03:01:37,490
my arms are too short okay that thing is
a it's a bottle

7287
03:01:37,490 --> 03:01:37,500
a it's a bottle
 

7288
03:01:37,500 --> 03:01:40,690
a it's a bottle
mmm

7289
03:01:40,690 --> 03:01:40,700

 

7290
03:01:40,700 --> 03:01:47,090

I mean I guess I have an idea

7291
03:01:47,090 --> 03:01:47,100

 

7292
03:01:47,100 --> 03:01:48,710

maybe another one

7293
03:01:48,710 --> 03:01:48,720
maybe another one
 

7294
03:01:48,720 --> 03:01:55,730
maybe another one
because I don't see any other tools

7295
03:01:55,730 --> 03:01:55,740

 

7296
03:01:55,740 --> 03:01:59,510

so how about we get it with

7297
03:01:59,510 --> 03:01:59,520
so how about we get it with
 

7298
03:01:59,520 --> 03:02:02,450
so how about we get it with
a long stick

7299
03:02:02,450 --> 03:02:02,460
a long stick
 

7300
03:02:02,460 --> 03:02:04,490
a long stick
no I'm not making a boat I'm making a

7301
03:02:04,490 --> 03:02:04,500
no I'm not making a boat I'm making a
 

7302
03:02:04,500 --> 03:02:05,330
no I'm not making a boat I'm making a
wait

7303
03:02:05,330 --> 03:02:05,340
wait
 

7304
03:02:05,340 --> 03:02:09,170
wait
there's tools

7305
03:02:09,170 --> 03:02:09,180

 

7306
03:02:09,180 --> 03:02:12,849

okay

7307
03:02:12,849 --> 03:02:12,859

 

7308
03:02:12,859 --> 03:02:17,570

well either way it would work I say

7309
03:02:17,570 --> 03:02:17,580
well either way it would work I say
 

7310
03:02:17,580 --> 03:02:19,610
well either way it would work I say
but

7311
03:02:19,610 --> 03:02:19,620
but
 

7312
03:02:19,620 --> 03:02:26,469
but
I like my stick idea

7313
03:02:26,469 --> 03:02:26,479

 

7314
03:02:26,479 --> 03:02:29,389

and that way my view will not be as

7315
03:02:29,389 --> 03:02:29,399
and that way my view will not be as
 

7316
03:02:29,399 --> 03:02:32,809
and that way my view will not be as
obstructed either

7317
03:02:32,809 --> 03:02:32,819

 

7318
03:02:32,819 --> 03:02:37,250

yeah that shall be

7319
03:02:37,250 --> 03:02:37,260

 

7320
03:02:37,260 --> 03:02:45,050

my technique

7321
03:02:45,050 --> 03:02:45,060

 

7322
03:02:45,060 --> 03:02:47,030

you think this will be long enough

7323
03:02:47,030 --> 03:02:47,040
you think this will be long enough
 

7324
03:02:47,040 --> 03:02:50,929
you think this will be long enough
actually dropped the Kodak uh Leaf I

7325
03:02:50,929 --> 03:02:50,939
actually dropped the Kodak uh Leaf I
 

7326
03:02:50,939 --> 03:02:52,849
actually dropped the Kodak uh Leaf I
think which I could use to make wind

7327
03:02:52,849 --> 03:02:52,859
think which I could use to make wind
 

7328
03:02:52,859 --> 03:02:55,269
think which I could use to make wind
with on the boat

7329
03:02:55,269 --> 03:02:55,279
with on the boat
 

7330
03:02:55,279 --> 03:02:58,010
with on the boat
that's kind of why I didn't do the boat

7331
03:02:58,010 --> 03:02:58,020
that's kind of why I didn't do the boat
 

7332
03:02:58,020 --> 03:03:03,469
that's kind of why I didn't do the boat
thing because I would have to use a

7333
03:03:03,469 --> 03:03:03,479

 

7334
03:03:03,479 --> 03:03:07,250

one of my own fans

7335
03:03:07,250 --> 03:03:07,260
one of my own fans
 

7336
03:03:07,260 --> 03:03:10,849
one of my own fans
my fans are very valuable to me

7337
03:03:10,849 --> 03:03:10,859
my fans are very valuable to me
 

7338
03:03:10,859 --> 03:03:12,710
my fans are very valuable to me
so I didn't want to do that but never

7339
03:03:12,710 --> 03:03:12,720
so I didn't want to do that but never
 

7340
03:03:12,720 --> 03:03:16,849
so I didn't want to do that but never
mind this is still not long enough

7341
03:03:16,849 --> 03:03:16,859

 

7342
03:03:16,859 --> 03:03:23,290

okay let's just use the boat

7343
03:03:23,290 --> 03:03:23,300

 

7344
03:03:23,300 --> 03:03:29,150

you you got what I was saying

7345
03:03:29,150 --> 03:03:29,160

 

7346
03:03:29,160 --> 03:03:32,990

did you get it you get it

7347
03:03:32,990 --> 03:03:33,000

 

7348
03:03:33,000 --> 03:03:34,220

okay

7349
03:03:34,220 --> 03:03:34,230
okay
 

7350
03:03:34,230 --> 03:03:34,309
okay

7354
03:03:38,640 --> 03:03:41,929

where is it

7355
03:03:41,929 --> 03:03:41,939

 

7356
03:03:41,939 --> 03:03:43,610

oh wait do I have to attach it to a

7357
03:03:43,610 --> 03:03:43,620
oh wait do I have to attach it to a
 

7358
03:03:43,620 --> 03:03:47,690
oh wait do I have to attach it to a
weapon

7359
03:03:47,690 --> 03:03:47,700

 

7360
03:03:47,700 --> 03:03:53,690

oh hmm

7361
03:03:53,690 --> 03:03:53,700

 

7362
03:03:53,700 --> 03:03:59,030

I'll uh pick the other one back up again

7363
03:03:59,030 --> 03:03:59,040
I'll uh pick the other one back up again
 

7364
03:03:59,040 --> 03:04:03,410
I'll uh pick the other one back up again
in a minute

7365
03:04:03,410 --> 03:04:03,420

 

7366
03:04:03,420 --> 03:04:06,110

where it could be

7367
03:04:06,110 --> 03:04:06,120
where it could be
 

7368
03:04:06,120 --> 03:04:10,910
where it could be
here oh I have actually a couple

7369
03:04:10,910 --> 03:04:10,920

 

7370
03:04:10,920 --> 03:04:16,540

no I'm stupid

7371
03:04:16,540 --> 03:04:16,550

 

7372
03:04:16,550 --> 03:04:22,010

[Music]

7373
03:04:22,010 --> 03:04:22,020

 

7374
03:04:22,020 --> 03:04:24,530

so this is the perfect combination

7375
03:04:24,530 --> 03:04:24,540
so this is the perfect combination
 

7376
03:04:24,540 --> 03:04:26,510
so this is the perfect combination
it just makes sense

7377
03:04:26,510 --> 03:04:26,520
it just makes sense
 

7378
03:04:26,520 --> 03:04:29,510
it just makes sense
attaching it to a tree branch don't you

7379
03:04:29,510 --> 03:04:29,520
attaching it to a tree branch don't you
 

7380
03:04:29,520 --> 03:04:33,110
attaching it to a tree branch don't you
think so do I have to do it backwards

7381
03:04:33,110 --> 03:04:33,120
think so do I have to do it backwards
 

7382
03:04:33,120 --> 03:04:35,030
think so do I have to do it backwards
I would think so but I think we're just

7383
03:04:35,030 --> 03:04:35,040
I would think so but I think we're just
 

7384
03:04:35,040 --> 03:04:35,870
I would think so but I think we're just
still

7385
03:04:35,870 --> 03:04:35,880
still
 

7386
03:04:35,880 --> 03:04:38,769
still
a little bit too close

7387
03:04:38,769 --> 03:04:38,779
a little bit too close
 

7388
03:04:38,779 --> 03:04:45,050
a little bit too close

7972
03:19:36,960 --> 03:19:38,870

7973
03:19:38,870 --> 03:19:38,880
but it's always the same like he does
 

7974
03:19:38,880 --> 03:19:40,670
but it's always the same like he does
the same thing over and over and over

7975
03:19:40,670 --> 03:19:40,680
the same thing over and over and over
 

7976

that's what it looks like to me because

10042
04:12:24,110 --> 04:12:24,120
that's what it looks like to me because

what if we would have just started by
going to the right side right away

okay we got the chest there's probably
just one chest in this Shrine so I guess

04:32:39,950 --> 04:32:39,960
just one chest in this Shrine so I guess

can we make it
 

10775
04:32:56,640 --> 04:32:59,510
can we make it
because there's only one fan

have you ever been on the ground or in

time you're watching my Zelda stream or
 

10785
04:33:12,359 --> 04:33:13,869
time you're watching my Zelda stream or
what

10786
04:33:13,869 --> 04:33:13,879
what
 

10787
04:33:13,879 --> 04:33:17,869
what
of course

10788
04:33:17,869 --> 04:33:17,879

 

10789
04:33:17,879 --> 04:33:20,150

I prefer though at least in my streams

10790
04:33:20,150 --> 04:33:20,160
I prefer though at least in my streams
 

10791
04:33:20,160 --> 04:33:24,470
I prefer though at least in my streams
to stay all on on the this level

10792
04:33:24,470 --> 04:33:24,480
to stay all on on the this level
 

10793
04:33:24,480 --> 04:33:27,769
to stay all on on the this level
because it just seems

10794
04:33:27,769 --> 04:33:27,779
because it just seems
 

10795
04:33:27,779 --> 04:33:29,390
because it just seems
should we start a little bit further

10796
04:33:29,390 --> 04:33:29,400
should we start a little bit further
 

10797
04:33:29,400 --> 04:33:31,609
should we start a little bit further
back

10798
04:33:31,609 --> 04:33:31,619
back
 

10799
04:33:31,619 --> 04:33:35,051
back
it just seems I don't know

10800
04:33:35,051 --> 04:33:35,061

 

10801
04:33:35,061 --> 04:33:38,109

more aesthetically pleasing for streams

10802
04:33:38,109 --> 04:33:38,119
more aesthetically pleasing for streams
 

10803
04:33:38,119 --> 04:33:40,670
more aesthetically pleasing for streams
I know that's a weird reason but I feel

10804
04:33:40,670 --> 04:33:40,680
I know that's a weird reason but I feel
 

10805
04:33:40,680 --> 04:33:43,070
I know that's a weird reason but I feel
like you know on the ground is dark and

10806
04:33:43,070 --> 04:33:43,080
like you know on the ground is dark and
 

10807
04:33:43,080 --> 04:33:45,769
like you know on the ground is dark and
very repetitive looking

10808
04:33:45,769 --> 04:33:45,779
very repetitive looking
 

10809
04:33:45,779 --> 04:33:49,010
very repetitive looking
and you know

10810
04:33:49,010 --> 04:33:49,020

 

10811
04:33:49,020 --> 04:33:51,590

you eat with your eyes too and don't you

10812
04:33:51,590 --> 04:33:51,600
you eat with your eyes too and don't you
 

10813
04:33:51,600 --> 04:33:56,109
you eat with your eyes too and don't you
want to like look at something like nice

10814
04:33:56,109 --> 04:33:56,119
want to like look at something like nice
 

10815
04:33:56,119 --> 04:33:58,250
want to like look at something like nice
yeah I'm thinking maybe it needs a

10816
04:33:58,250 --> 04:33:58,260
yeah I'm thinking maybe it needs a
 

10817
04:33:58,260 --> 04:33:59,449
yeah I'm thinking maybe it needs a
little bit of a running start but like

10818
04:33:59,449 --> 04:33:59,459
little bit of a running start but like
 

10819
04:33:59,459 --> 04:34:05,150
little bit of a running start but like
how much

10820
04:34:05,150 --> 04:34:05,160

 

10821
04:34:05,160 --> 04:34:07,789

things should I have instead placed the

10822
04:34:07,789 --> 04:34:07,799
things should I have instead placed the
 

10823
04:34:07,799 --> 04:34:10,670
things should I have instead placed the
the fan underneath so I'll fly higher

10824
04:34:10,670 --> 04:34:10,680
the fan underneath so I'll fly higher
 

10825
04:34:10,680 --> 04:34:14,150
the fan underneath so I'll fly higher
this way I'll just lie faster I guess

10826
04:34:14,150 --> 04:34:14,160
this way I'll just lie faster I guess
 

10827
04:34:14,160 --> 04:34:17,230
this way I'll just lie faster I guess
first time watching don't [\h__\h] me

10828
04:34:17,230 --> 04:34:17,240
first time watching don't [\h__\h] me
 

10829
04:34:17,240 --> 04:34:20,269
first time watching don't [\h__\h] me
wait worst case we also have the Guster

10830
04:34:20,269 --> 04:34:20,279
wait worst case we also have the Guster
 

10831
04:34:20,279 --> 04:34:26,869
wait worst case we also have the Guster
which will surely help us too

10832
04:34:26,869 --> 04:34:26,879

 

10833
04:34:26,879 --> 04:34:28,789

I'm scared that I would be using it in

10834
04:34:28,789 --> 04:34:28,799
I'm scared that I would be using it in
 

10835
04:34:28,799 --> 04:34:31,089
I'm scared that I would be using it in
the wrong direction though [\h__\h]

10836
04:34:31,089 --> 04:34:31,099
the wrong direction though [\h__\h]

10839
04:34:39,779 --> 04:34:48,709

can I get my glider back when I revive

10840
04:34:48,709 --> 04:34:48,719

 

10841
04:34:48,719 --> 04:34:56,990

well we barely got anywhere

10842
04:34:56,990 --> 04:34:57,000

 

10843
04:34:57,000 --> 04:35:00,830

what the [\h__\h]

10844
04:35:00,830 --> 04:35:00,840

 

10845
04:35:00,840 --> 04:35:06,830

maybe I do need a tight

10846
04:35:06,830 --> 04:35:06,840

 

10847
04:35:06,840 --> 04:35:08,810

I mean I turned it off once too early

10848
04:35:08,810 --> 04:35:08,820
I mean I turned it off once too early
 

10849
04:35:08,820 --> 04:35:11,510
I mean I turned it off once too early
but I don't think that was necessarily

10850
04:35:11,510 --> 04:35:11,520
but I don't think that was necessarily
 

10851
04:35:11,520 --> 04:35:13,369
but I don't think that was necessarily
the problem

10852
04:35:13,369 --> 04:35:13,379
the problem
 

10853
04:35:13,379 --> 04:35:15,949
the problem
so maybe it does need this

10854
04:35:15,949 --> 04:35:15,959
so maybe it does need this
 

10855
04:35:15,959 --> 04:35:18,709
so maybe it does need this
you place it at the top

10856
04:35:18,709 --> 04:35:18,719
you place it at the top
 

10857
04:35:18,719 --> 04:35:24,070
you place it at the top
what

10858
04:35:24,070 --> 04:35:24,080

 

10859
04:35:24,080 --> 04:35:26,689

you think it's just because I turned it

10860
04:35:26,689 --> 04:35:26,699
you think it's just because I turned it
 

10861
04:35:26,699 --> 04:35:28,429
you think it's just because I turned it
off

10862
04:35:28,429 --> 04:35:28,439
off
 

10863
04:35:28,439 --> 04:35:31,189
off
actually like this and might not even be

10864
04:35:31,189 --> 04:35:31,199
actually like this and might not even be
 

10865
04:35:31,199 --> 04:35:35,269
actually like this and might not even be
rolling

10866
04:35:35,269 --> 04:35:35,279

 

10867
04:35:35,279 --> 04:35:46,010

don't okay

10868
04:35:46,010 --> 04:35:46,020

 

10869
04:35:46,020 --> 04:35:47,869

you're now very good at shooting
close-up people either huh I'm not gonna

14662
06:16:47,270 --> 06:16:47,280
close-up people either huh I'm not gonna
 

14663
06:16:47,280 --> 06:16:51,288
close-up people either huh I'm not gonna
judge you because I wasn't deeper

14664
06:16:51,288 --> 06:16:51,298

 

14665

it's all propaganda
 

14669
06:16:56,940 --> 06:16:59,930
it's all propaganda
you know back in the day you know in um

14670
06:16:59,930 --> 06:16:59,940
you know back in the day you know in um
 

14671
06:16:59,940 --> 06:17:02,110
you know back in the day you know in um
I don't know the 40s maybe

14672
06:17:02,110 --> 06:17:02,120
I don't know the 40s maybe
 

14673
06:17:02,120 --> 06:17:07,430
I don't know the 40s maybe
30s 20s The Roaring Twenties people used

14674
06:17:07,430 --> 06:17:07,440
30s 20s The Roaring Twenties people used
 

14675
06:17:07,440 --> 06:17:11,990
30s 20s The Roaring Twenties people used
to see black and white yeah

14676
06:17:11,990 --> 06:17:12,000

 

14677
06:17:12,000 --> 06:17:14,750

um evidence is in the black and white

14678
06:17:14,750 --> 06:17:14,760
um evidence is in the black and white
 

14679
06:17:14,760 --> 06:17:17,868
um evidence is in the black and white
movies yeah

14680
06:17:17,868 --> 06:17:17,878

 

14681
06:17:17,878 --> 06:17:19,670

but you know it's just like you know

14682
06:17:19,670 --> 06:17:19,680
but you know it's just like you know
 

14683
06:17:19,680 --> 06:17:22,250
but you know it's just like you know
there's there's there's obvious proof

14684
06:17:22,250 --> 06:17:22,260
there's there's there's obvious proof
 

14685
06:17:22,260 --> 06:17:24,410
there's there's there's obvious proof
that this is a fact by the looking at

14686
06:17:24,410 --> 06:17:24,420
that this is a fact by the looking at
 

14687
06:17:24,420 --> 06:17:25,970
that this is a fact by the looking at
the black and white movies people saw

14688
06:17:25,970 --> 06:17:25,980
the black and white movies people saw
 

14689
06:17:25,980 --> 06:17:28,490
the black and white movies people saw
and they also wear black and white yeah

14690
06:17:28,490 --> 06:17:28,500
and they also wear black and white yeah
 

14691
06:17:28,500 --> 06:17:31,490
and they also wear black and white yeah
and yet it's something of like a similar

14692
06:17:31,490 --> 06:17:31,500
and yet it's something of like a similar
 

14693
06:17:31,500 --> 06:17:32,868
and yet it's something of like a similar
matter as like you know whether or not

14694
06:17:32,868 --> 06:17:32,878
matter as like you know whether or not
 

14695
06:17:32,878 --> 06:17:38,330
matter as like you know whether or not
the Earth is flat or around

14696
06:17:38,330 --> 06:17:38,340

 

14697
06:17:38,340 --> 06:17:40,610

obviously the Earth is round and there's

14698
06:17:40,610 --> 06:17:40,620
obviously the Earth is round and there's
 

14699
06:17:40,620 --> 06:17:44,690
obviously the Earth is round and there's
proof for it but people oh

14700
06:17:44,690 --> 06:17:44,700

 

14701
06:17:44,700 --> 06:17:47,750

oh no fairy people still somehow seem to

14702
06:17:47,750 --> 06:17:47,760
oh no fairy people still somehow seem to
 

14703
06:17:47,760 --> 06:17:50,510
oh no fairy people still somehow seem to
think sometimes that they are that the

14704
06:17:50,510 --> 06:17:50,520
think sometimes that they are that the
 

14705
06:17:50,520 --> 06:17:52,730
think sometimes that they are that the
Earth is flat

14706
06:17:52,730 --> 06:17:52,740
Earth is flat
 

14707
06:17:52,740 --> 06:17:55,010
Earth is flat
um now here I am on the side of the

14708
06:17:55,010 --> 06:17:55,020
um now here I am on the side of the
 

14709
06:17:55,020 --> 06:17:57,110
um now here I am on the side of the
round office because there is preferred

14710
06:17:57,110 --> 06:17:57,120
round office because there is preferred
 

14711
06:17:57,120 --> 06:17:58,670
round office because there is preferred
but

14712
06:17:58,670 --> 06:17:58,680
but
 

14713
06:17:58,680 --> 06:18:01,368
but
there's also proof for the Earth and

14714
06:18:01,368 --> 06:18:01,378
there's also proof for the Earth and
 

14715
06:18:01,378 --> 06:18:04,070
there's also proof for the Earth and
everything to have been black and white

14716
06:18:04,070 --> 06:18:04,080
everything to have been black and white
 

14717
06:18:04,080 --> 06:18:06,830
everything to have been black and white
before

yes yes
 

14721
06:18:08,298 --> 06:18:11,270
yes yes
always in the end I say follow the proof

14722
06:18:11,270 --> 06:18:11,280
always in the end I say follow the proof
 

14723
06:18:11,280 --> 06:18:12,110
always in the end I say follow the proof
guys

14724
06:18:12,110 --> 06:18:12,120

the other ones before I open them
 

17243
07:29:36,780 --> 07:29:39,230
the other ones before I open them
because I feel like the other ones are

17244
07:29:39,230 --> 07:29:39,240
because I feel like the other ones are
 

17245
07:29:39,240 --> 07:29:41,030
because I feel like the other ones are
not going to be much different

08:16:29,150 --> 08:16:29,160
good step in the right direction but it
 

18803
08:16:29,160 --> 08:16:31,128
good step in the right direction but it

and what he said and I thought he would

18810
08:16:38,510 --> 08:16:38,520
and what he said and I thought he would
 

18811
08:16:38,520 --> 08:16:40,788
and what he said and I thought he would
be like super hyped once he reaches the

18812
08:16:40,788 --> 08:16:40,798
be like super hyped once he reaches the
 

18813
08:16:40,798 --> 08:16:44,048
be like super hyped once he reaches the
first dungeon

18818
08:16:50,030 --> 08:16:50,040
would like it that's kind of the point
 

18819
08:16:50,040 --> 08:16:53,150
would like it that's kind of the point
yeah maybe because Divine beasts were

18820
08:16:53,150 --> 08:16:53,160
yeah maybe because Divine beasts were
 

18821
08:16:53,160 --> 08:16:54,468
yeah maybe because Divine beasts were
such a big thing

18822
08:16:54,468 --> 08:16:54,478
such a big thing
 

18823
08:16:54,478 --> 08:16:57,170
such a big thing

08:17:00,770 --> 08:17:00,780
either I don't think he really thought
 

18829
08:17:00,780 --> 08:17:03,530
either I don't think he really thought
it was bad either but it just it's just

18830
08:17:03,530 --> 08:17:03,540
it was bad either but it just it's just
 

18831
08:17:03,540 --> 08:17:05,860
it was bad either but it just it's just
that he prefers temples

18832
08:17:05,860 --> 08:17:05,870
that he prefers temples
 

18833
