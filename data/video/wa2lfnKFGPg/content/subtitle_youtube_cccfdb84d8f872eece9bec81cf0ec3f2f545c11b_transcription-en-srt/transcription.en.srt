02:08:31,550 --> 02:08:31,560
why they don't do it with 3D in
 

4701
02:08:31,560 --> 02:08:34,970
why they don't do it with 3D in

movement looks so so nice and if I want
 

8179
03:36:51,779 --> 03:36:53,570
movement looks so so nice and if I want
to do more VR stuff that might actually

8180
03:36:53,570 --> 03:36:53,580
to do more VR stuff that might actually
 

8181
03:36:53,580 --> 03:36:55,750
to do more VR stuff that might actually
be worth investing in

8182
03:36:55,750 --> 03:36:55,760
be worth investing in
 

8183
03:36:55,760 --> 03:37:02,330

it takes a while
 

8215
03:37:44,640 --> 03:37:46,130
it takes a while
there's not even an interesting phone

8216

conversation going on
 

8219
03:37:47,880 --> 03:37:49,670
conversation going on
I guess is there no reception on the

8220
03:37:49,670 --> 03:37:49,680
I guess is there no reception on the
 

8221
03:37:49,680 --> 03:37:50,389
I guess is there no reception on the
water

8222
03:37:50,389 --> 03:37:50,399
water
 

8223
03:37:50,399 --> 03:37:53,030
water
what would there be no reception on the

8224
03:37:53,030 --> 03:37:53,040
what would there be no reception on the
 

8225
03:37:53,040 --> 03:37:54,290
what would there be no reception on the
water

8226
03:37:54,290 --> 03:37:54,300
water
 

8227
03:37:54,300 --> 03:37:56,090
water
is that a stupid question

8228
03:37:56,090 --> 03:37:56,100
is that a stupid question
 

8229
03:37:56,100 --> 03:37:58,429
is that a stupid question
I mean sometimes you have reception on

8230
03:37:58,429 --> 03:37:58,439
I mean sometimes you have reception on
 

8231
03:37:58,439 --> 03:38:00,349
I mean sometimes you have reception on
on the mountain if you don't go up too

8232
03:38:00,349 --> 03:38:00,359
on the mountain if you don't go up too
 

8233
03:38:00,359 --> 03:38:02,330
on the mountain if you don't go up too
high

8234
03:38:02,330 --> 03:38:02,340
high
 

8235
03:38:02,340 --> 03:38:05,950
high
f for five so now now now

8236
03:38:05,950 --> 03:38:05,960
f for five so now now now
 

8237
03:38:05,960 --> 03:38:09,229
f for five so now now now
I'm not gonna press f for faster

8238
03:38:09,229 --> 03:38:09,239
I'm not gonna press f for faster
 

8239
03:38:09,239 --> 03:38:17,330
I'm not gonna press f for faster
nope

8240
03:38:17,330 --> 03:38:17,340

 

8241
03:38:17,340 --> 03:38:19,729

I I would think so too that it absorbs

8242
03:38:19,729 --> 03:38:19,739
I I would think so too that it absorbs
 

8243
03:38:19,739 --> 03:38:22,070
I I would think so too that it absorbs
the signals but I didn't I'm not sure

8244
03:38:22,070 --> 03:38:22,080
the signals but I didn't I'm not sure
 

8245
03:38:22,080 --> 03:38:23,570
the signals but I didn't I'm not sure
like how

8246
03:38:23,570 --> 03:38:23,580
like how
 

8247
03:38:23,580 --> 03:38:25,610
like how
maybe if you're just right above the

8248
03:38:25,610 --> 03:38:25,620
maybe if you're just right above the
 

8249
03:38:25,620 --> 03:38:27,590
maybe if you're just right above the
surface it would still work but maybe

8250
03:38:27,590 --> 03:38:27,600
surface it would still work but maybe
 

8251
03:38:27,600 --> 03:38:30,769
surface it would still work but maybe
also this whole building blocks it this

8252
03:38:30,769 --> 03:38:30,779
also this whole building blocks it this
 

8253
03:38:30,779 --> 03:38:33,469
also this whole building blocks it this
building of a submarine

8254
03:38:33,469 --> 03:38:33,479
building of a submarine
 

8255
03:38:33,479 --> 03:38:36,130

what do I know

8256
03:38:36,130 --> 03:38:36,140
what do I know
 

8257
03:38:36,140 --> 03:38:39,050
what do I know
f for fish yeah I've already

8258
03:38:39,050 --> 03:38:39,060
