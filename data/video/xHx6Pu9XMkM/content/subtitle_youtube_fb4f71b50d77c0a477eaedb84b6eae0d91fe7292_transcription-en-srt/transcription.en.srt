03:36:17,700 --> 03:36:19,429

but it's it's

8690
03:36:19,429 --> 03:36:19,439
but it's it's
 

8691
03:36:19,439 --> 03:36:23,150
but it's it's
um like detecting the weight changes in

8692
03:36:23,150 --> 03:36:23,160
um like detecting the weight changes in
 

8693
03:36:23,160 --> 03:36:25,550
um like detecting the weight changes in
the toilet and then it knows oh there's

8694
03:36:25,550 --> 03:36:25,560
the toilet and then it knows oh there's
 

8695
03:36:25,560 --> 03:36:27,110
the toilet and then it knows oh there's
a cat in here right now and then when it

8696
03:36:27,110 --> 03:36:27,120
a cat in here right now and then when it
 

8697
03:36:27,120 --> 03:36:28,490
a cat in here right now and then when it
leaves it goes back to the original way

8698
03:36:28,490 --> 03:36:28,500
leaves it goes back to the original way
 

8699
03:36:28,500 --> 03:36:29,809
leaves it goes back to the original way
so then it's like okay I'm gonna start

8700
03:36:29,809 --> 03:36:29,819
so then it's like okay I'm gonna start
 

8701
03:36:29,819 --> 03:36:33,590
so then it's like okay I'm gonna start
cycling now whoosh whoosh

8702
03:36:33,590 --> 03:36:33,600
cycling now whoosh whoosh
 

8703
03:36:33,600 --> 03:36:35,630
cycling now whoosh whoosh
it didn't do that the previous time when

8704
03:36:35,630 --> 03:36:35,640
it didn't do that the previous time when
 

8705
03:36:35,640 --> 03:36:37,550
it didn't do that the previous time when
I put the last time when I put my cat in

8706
03:36:37,550 --> 03:36:37,560
I put the last time when I put my cat in
 

8707
03:36:37,560 --> 03:36:41,210
I put the last time when I put my cat in
but I think generally it works

8708
03:36:41,210 --> 03:36:41,220
but I think generally it works
 

8709
03:36:41,220 --> 03:36:42,950
but I think generally it works
and it's honestly it's fine if it

8710
03:36:42,950 --> 03:36:42,960
and it's honestly it's fine if it
 

8711
03:36:42,960 --> 03:36:44,809
and it's honestly it's fine if it
doesn't do it and every time I think

8712
03:36:44,809 --> 03:36:44,819
doesn't do it and every time I think
 

8713
03:36:44,819 --> 03:36:47,450
doesn't do it and every time I think
because

8714
03:36:47,450 --> 03:36:47,460

 

8715
03:36:47,460 --> 03:36:48,830

that's fine

8716
03:36:48,830 --> 03:36:48,840

8777
03:38:05,600 --> 03:38:08,389

I'm like at least she likes it I don't

8778
03:38:08,389 --> 03:38:08,399
I'm like at least she likes it I don't
 

8779
03:38:08,399 --> 03:38:10,250
I'm like at least she likes it I don't
know if she's like she understands that

8780
03:38:10,250 --> 03:38:10,260
know if she's like she understands that
 

8781
03:38:10,260 --> 03:38:14,889
know if she's like she understands that
this is a toilet but it's the same

8782
03:38:14,889 --> 03:38:14,899
this is a toilet but it's the same
 

8783
03:38:14,899 --> 03:38:17,690
this is a toilet but it's the same
toilet sand that I use in the other

8784
03:38:17,690 --> 03:38:17,700
toilet sand that I use in the other
 

8785
03:38:17,700 --> 03:38:21,229
toilet sand that I use in the other
toilet so she should recognize that

8786
03:38:21,229 --> 03:38:21,239
toilet so she should recognize that
 

8787
03:38:21,239 --> 03:38:22,990
toilet so she should recognize that
was really cute

8788
03:38:22,990 --> 03:38:23,000
was really cute
 

8789
03:38:23,000 --> 03:38:25,849
was really cute
and I think the fact because chunkers

8790
03:38:25,849 --> 03:38:25,859
and I think the fact because chunkers
 

8791
03:38:25,859 --> 03:38:27,410
and I think the fact because chunkers
entered

8792
03:38:27,410 --> 03:38:27,420
entered
 

8793
03:38:27,420 --> 03:38:28,550
entered
um the room

8794
03:38:28,550 --> 03:38:28,560
um the room
 

8795
03:38:28,560 --> 03:38:31,610
um the room
well smoothie was purring inside the

8796
03:38:31,610 --> 03:38:31,620
well smoothie was purring inside the
 

8797
03:38:31,620 --> 03:38:34,309
well smoothie was purring inside the
toilet and I think that kind of let

8798
03:38:34,309 --> 03:38:34,319
toilet and I think that kind of let
 

8799
03:38:34,319 --> 03:38:37,190
toilet and I think that kind of let
junkers know that this thing is safe and

8800
03:38:37,190 --> 03:38:37,200
junkers know that this thing is safe and
 

8801
03:38:37,200 --> 03:38:38,990
junkers know that this thing is safe and
okay

8802
03:38:38,990 --> 03:38:39,000

8803
03:38:39,000 --> 03:38:42,050
okay

8804
03:38:42,050 --> 03:38:42,060
