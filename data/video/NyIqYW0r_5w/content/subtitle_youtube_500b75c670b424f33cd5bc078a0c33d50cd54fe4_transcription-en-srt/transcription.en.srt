maybe let's start and warm up with dots
 

219
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,830
maybe let's start and warm up with dots
and boxes where i'm probably not gonna

220
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:25,840
and boxes where i'm probably not gonna
 

221
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,150
and boxes where i'm probably not gonna
get my guaranteed win i

222
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:28,160
get my guaranteed win i
 

223
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,670

so you can't fool someone who doesn't
 

1845

um

1848
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:53,040
um
 

1849
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,870
um
how the game works also i find it

1850
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:54,880
how the game works also i find it
 

1851
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,230
how the game works also i find it
interesting that if you are able to

1852
00:41:58,230 --> 00:41:58,240
interesting that if you are able to
 

1853
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:05,109
interesting that if you are able to
get someone the game forces you to go

1854
00:42:05,109 --> 00:42:05,119

 

1855
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:07,430

they don't let me move anything else

1856
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:07,440
they don't let me move anything else
 

1857
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,109
they don't let me move anything else
because sometimes that's not a good

1858
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:09,119
because sometimes that's not a good
 

1859
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:10,470
because sometimes that's not a good
strategy

1860
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:10,480
strategy
 

1861
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,230
strategy

00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:32,800

 

2383
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,630

00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:42,150
an empty pocket
it's capturing ah in an empty

2392
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:42,160
it's capturing ah in an empty
 

2393
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,710
it's capturing ah in an empty
yeah that is also a rule they are not

yeah that is also a rule they are not
 

2395
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,790
yeah that is also a rule they are not
using the optimal strategy right now

2396
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:46,800
using the optimal strategy right now
 

2397
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,430
using the optimal strategy right now
though in this tutorial i'm already i'm

2398

2400
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:52,720
backstaging them they should have moved
 

2401
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,390
backstaging them they should have moved

to teach me
i will show you the optimal strategies

2432
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:33,440
i will show you the optimal strategies
 

2433
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,750

2446
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:47,760
all right well you probably want to
 

2447
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,309
all right well you probably want to
start well maybe you already know

2448
00:54:50,309 --> 00:54:50,319
start well maybe you already know
 

2449
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:52,789
start well maybe you already know
let me try uh if i start with these four

2450
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:52,799
let me try uh if i start with these four
 

2451
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:55,349
let me try uh if i start with these four
it drops one two three four the last one

2452
00:54:55,349 --> 00:54:55,359
it drops one two three four the last one
 

2453
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:57,670
it drops one two three four the last one
will be in the big one right

2454
00:54:57,670 --> 00:54:57,680
will be in the big one right
 

2455
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,190
will be in the big one right
okay

2456
00:54:59,190 --> 00:54:59,200
okay
 

2457
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,549

all right okay
 

2459
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:05,670
all right okay
extra turn ah uh in that case

2460
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:05,680
extra turn ah uh in that case
 

2461
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:09,510
extra turn ah uh in that case
i can't really do the same thing again

2462
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:09,520
i can't really do the same thing again
 

2463
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,190
i can't really do the same thing again
so

2464
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:11,200
so
 

2465
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,549
so
i don't know i mean there's probably

2466
00:55:12,549 --> 00:55:12,559
i don't know i mean there's probably
 

2467
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,470
i don't know i mean there's probably
debate at this point about what the best

2468
00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:14,480
debate at this point about what the best
 

2469
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,390
debate at this point about what the best
move is probably at least i don't want

2470
00:55:16,390 --> 00:55:16,400
move is probably at least i don't want
 

2471
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,150
move is probably at least i don't want
