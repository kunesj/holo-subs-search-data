maybe my card got blocked and i need to

1746
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:44,160
maybe my card got blocked and i need to
 

1747
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,630
maybe my card got blocked and i need to
call the bank or it's actually the the

1748
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:46,640
call the bank or it's actually the the
 

1749
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,069
call the bank or it's actually the the
banks here that don't take my card
