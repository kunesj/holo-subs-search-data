other one i should be able to make
 

5893
02:26:55,280 --> 02:26:57,190
other one i should be able to make
because it's without meat and i think

5894
02:26:57,190 --> 02:26:57,200
because it's without meat and i think
 

5895
02:26:57,200 --> 02:26:58,870
because it's without meat and i think
the the rest

5896
02:26:58,870 --> 02:26:58,880
the the rest
 

5897
02:26:58,880 --> 02:27:01,270

we'll design it well we'll prepare it
 

9483
03:44:05,840 --> 03:44:07,429
we'll design it well we'll prepare it
beforehand

9484
03:44:07,429 --> 03:44:07,439
beforehand
 

9485
03:44:07,439 --> 03:44:08,229
beforehand
uh

9486
03:44:08,229 --> 03:44:08,239
