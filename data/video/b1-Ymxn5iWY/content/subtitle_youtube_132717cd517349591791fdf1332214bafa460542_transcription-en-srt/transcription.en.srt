so if you survive until then you can

8036
03:21:21,710 --> 03:21:21,720
so if you survive until then you can
 

8037
03:21:21,720 --> 03:21:25,110
so if you survive until then you can
participate in that so yeah I'm just

8038

participate in that so yeah I'm just
 

8039
03:21:25,120 --> 03:21:30,910
participate in that so yeah I'm just
like uh you trying to you know be part

8040
03:21:30,910 --> 03:21:30,920
like uh you trying to you know be part
 

8041
03:21:30,920 --> 03:21:34,189
like uh you trying to you know be part
of it as long as I can and uh that's why

8042
03:21:34,189 --> 03:21:34,199
of it as long as I can and uh that's why
 

8043
03:21:34,199 --> 03:21:36,590
of it as long as I can and uh that's why
also there's earlier streams because um

8044
03:21:36,590 --> 03:21:36,600
also there's earlier streams because um
 

8045
03:21:36,600 --> 03:21:38,750
also there's earlier streams because um
you know Japanese prime time is around

8046
03:21:38,750 --> 03:21:38,760
you know Japanese prime time is around
 

8047
03:21:38,760 --> 03:21:41,870
you know Japanese prime time is around
that time yeah so I might even start the

8048
03:21:41,870 --> 03:21:41,880
that time yeah so I might even start the
 

8049
03:21:41,880 --> 03:21:44,110
that time yeah so I might even start the
first day stream 1 hour early because I

8050
03:21:44,110 --> 03:21:44,120
first day stream 1 hour early because I
 

8051
03:21:44,120 --> 03:21:47,269
first day stream 1 hour early because I
just saw some information that they are

8052
03:21:47,269 --> 03:21:47,279
just saw some information that they are
 

8053
03:21:47,279 --> 03:21:49,910
just saw some information that they are
uh doing something right at that

8054
03:21:49,910 --> 03:21:49,920
uh doing something right at that
 

8055
03:21:49,920 --> 03:21:52,189
uh doing something right at that
starting time so I thought oh maybe I'll

8056
03:21:52,189 --> 03:21:52,199
starting time so I thought oh maybe I'll
 

8057
03:21:52,199 --> 03:21:53,750
starting time so I thought oh maybe I'll
start a little bit earlier to find my

8058
03:21:53,750 --> 03:21:53,760
start a little bit earlier to find my
 

8059
03:21:53,760 --> 03:21:56,389
start a little bit earlier to find my
footing first and then I can join into

8060
03:21:56,389 --> 03:21:56,399
footing first and then I can join into
 

8061
03:21:56,399 --> 03:21:58,990
footing first and then I can join into
the thing that they're doing uh right at

8062
03:21:58,990 --> 03:21:59,000
the thing that they're doing uh right at
 

8063
03:21:59,000 --> 03:22:01,790
the thing that they're doing uh right at
that time you know what I mean yeah so

8064
03:22:01,790 --> 03:22:01,800
that time you know what I mean yeah so

will be the last time I had it on for

9098
03:49:48,510 --> 03:49:48,520
will be the last time I had it on for
 

9099
03:49:48,520 --> 03:49:51,670
will be the last time I had it on for
today turned off every tracker this time

9100
03:49:51,670 --> 03:49:51,680
today turned off every tracker this time
 

9101
03:49:51,680 --> 03:49:54,149
today turned off every tracker this time
because like in previous times I would

9102
03:49:54,149 --> 03:49:54,159
because like in previous times I would
 

9103
03:49:54,159 --> 03:49:56,469
because like in previous times I would
just like take all the straps and The

9104
03:49:56,469 --> 03:49:56,479
just like take all the straps and The
 

9105
03:49:56,479 --> 03:50:00,429
just like take all the straps and The
Trackers off and just leave it be but uh

9106
03:50:00,429 --> 03:50:00,439
Trackers off and just leave it be but uh
 

9107
03:50:00,439 --> 03:50:02,830
Trackers off and just leave it be but uh
this time I always turned every single

9108
03:50:02,830 --> 03:50:02,840
this time I always turned every single
 

9109
03:50:02,840 --> 03:50:05,550
this time I always turned every single
tracker off which takes a while because

9110
03:50:05,550 --> 03:50:05,560
tracker off which takes a while because
 

9111
03:50:05,560 --> 03:50:07,910
tracker off which takes a while because
you have to push each button like six

9112
03:50:07,910 --> 03:50:07,920
you have to push each button like six
 

9113
03:50:07,920 --> 03:50:10,750
you have to push each button like six
seconds long for every tracker and

9114
03:50:10,750 --> 03:50:10,760
seconds long for every tracker and
 

9115
03:50:10,760 --> 03:50:12,870
seconds long for every tracker and
there's like 20 or

9116
03:50:12,870 --> 03:50:12,880
there's like 20 or
 

9117
03:50:12,880 --> 03:50:15,469
there's like 20 or
so um

9118
03:50:15,469 --> 03:50:15,479
so um
 

9119
03:50:15,479 --> 03:50:17,110
so um
but this way I saved the batteries and

9120
03:50:17,110 --> 03:50:17,120
but this way I saved the batteries and
 

9121
03:50:17,120 --> 03:50:19,830
but this way I saved the batteries and
didn't have to charge in between and

9122
03:50:19,830 --> 03:50:19,840
didn't have to charge in between and
 

9123
03:50:19,840 --> 03:50:21,950
didn't have to charge in between and
having to charge every single tracker is

9124
03:50:21,950 --> 03:50:21,960
having to charge every single tracker is
 

9125
03:50:21,960 --> 03:50:23,389
having to charge every single tracker is
also

9126
03:50:23,389 --> 03:50:23,399
also
 

9127
03:50:23,399 --> 03:50:27,630
also
annoying but yeah then I realized oh

9128
03:50:27,630 --> 03:50:27,640
annoying but yeah then I realized oh
 

9129
03:50:27,640 --> 03:50:31,030
annoying but yeah then I realized oh

9141
03:50:43,080 --> 03:50:45,349
chicken uh chagy maybe would have been
able to do some

9142
03:50:45,349 --> 03:50:45,359
able to do some

03:50:54,630 --> 03:50:54,640
thought it would be nicer since the
 

9151
03:50:54,640 --> 03:50:58,830
thought it would be nicer since the
chicken does have the ability to be

9154
03:51:01,710 --> 03:51:01,720

9155
03:51:01,720 --> 03:51:03,710

well do it

9156
03:51:03,710 --> 03:51:03,720
well do it
 

9157
03:51:03,720 --> 03:51:06,389

so I did some simple
 

9159
03:51:06,399 --> 03:51:08,990
so I did some simple
movements that should work with that

9160
03:51:08,990 --> 03:51:09,000
