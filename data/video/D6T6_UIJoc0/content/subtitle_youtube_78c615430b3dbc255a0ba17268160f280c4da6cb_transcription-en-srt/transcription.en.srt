will have to be shooting arrows at Muna
 

1559
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:12,890
will have to be shooting arrows at Muna
when she's flying and

1560
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:12,900
when she's flying and
 

1561
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:15,710
when she's flying and
um we are actually uh one person less

1562
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:15,720
um we are actually uh one person less
 

1563
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,990
um we are actually uh one person less
than their team

1564
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:18,000
than their team
 

1565
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,730
than their team
um so they have one more person to shoot

1566
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:19,740
um so they have one more person to shoot
 

1567
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:22,069
um so they have one more person to shoot
arrows but um they told me yesterday

1568
00:53:22,069 --> 00:53:22,079
arrows but um they told me yesterday
 

1569
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:25,190
arrows but um they told me yesterday
that we will just get five more arrows

1570
00:53:25,190 --> 00:53:25,200
that we will just get five more arrows
 

1571
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,650
that we will just get five more arrows
and we can either give only one person

1572
00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:27,660
and we can either give only one person
 

1573
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:29,150
and we can either give only one person
five more errors but I think that's a

1574
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:29,160
five more errors but I think that's a
 

1575
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,710
five more errors but I think that's a
bit too much or we can spread them over

1576
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:30,720
bit too much or we can spread them over
 

1577
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,490
bit too much or we can spread them over

01:23:54,179 --> 01:23:57,530
yourselves
but right now right now

2618
01:23:57,530 --> 01:23:57,540
but right now right now
 

2619
01:23:57,540 --> 01:24:00,169
but right now right now
it's not our turn yet anyway so wait

2620
01:24:00,169 --> 01:24:00,179
it's not our turn yet anyway so wait
 

2621
01:24:00,179 --> 01:24:02,090
it's not our turn yet anyway so wait
what how many challenges do we should we

2622
01:24:02,090 --> 01:24:02,100
what how many challenges do we should we
 

2623
01:24:02,100 --> 01:24:03,410
what how many challenges do we should we
go to

2624
01:24:03,410 --> 01:24:03,420
go to
 

2625
01:24:03,420 --> 01:24:06,770
go to
oh oh this is where we watch okay okay

2626
01:24:06,770 --> 01:24:06,780
oh oh this is where we watch okay okay
 

2627
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:08,810
oh oh this is where we watch okay okay
since it's not our turn right now anyway

2628
01:24:08,810 --> 01:24:08,820
since it's not our turn right now anyway
 

2629
01:24:08,820 --> 01:24:11,330
since it's not our turn right now anyway
when you see them flying in the next

2630
01:24:11,330 --> 01:24:11,340
when you see them flying in the next
 

2631
01:24:11,340 --> 01:24:14,030
when you see them flying in the next
turn then just adjust your chunks

2632
01:24:14,030 --> 01:24:14,040
turn then just adjust your chunks
 

2633
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:16,990
turn then just adjust your chunks
according to that I guess

2634
01:24:16,990 --> 01:24:17,000
according to that I guess
 

2635
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,010
according to that I guess
when they fly because we still got time

2636
01:24:19,010 --> 01:24:19,020
when they fly because we still got time
 

2637
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:20,290
when they fly because we still got time
anyway

2638
01:24:20,290 --> 01:24:20,300
anyway
 

2639
01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:23,930
anyway
is flying in the sky so maybe try to

2640
01:24:23,930 --> 01:24:23,940
is flying in the sky so maybe try to
 

2641
01:24:23,940 --> 01:24:25,729
is flying in the sky so maybe try to
figure I can see that you can see here

2642
01:24:25,729 --> 01:24:25,739
figure I can see that you can see here
 

2643
01:24:25,739 --> 01:24:27,470
figure I can see that you can see here

01:26:35,629 --> 01:26:35,639
here yeah but right now pecora sample
 

2721
01:26:35,639 --> 01:26:37,910
here yeah but right now pecora sample
from Red's team a will be flying so

2722
01:26:37,910 --> 01:26:37,920
from Red's team a will be flying so

2725
01:26:41,639 --> 01:26:43,129
white team a will be shooting her yes oh
I don't know how this works I just

2726
01:26:43,129 --> 01:26:43,139
I don't know how this works I just
 

2727
01:26:43,139 --> 01:26:44,930
I don't know how this works I just
realized okay let's take a look at what

2728
01:26:44,930 --> 01:26:44,940
realized okay let's take a look at what
 

2729
01:26:44,940 --> 01:26:47,149
realized okay let's take a look at what
they're gonna do now so is behind us if

2730
01:26:47,149 --> 01:26:47,159
they're gonna do now so is behind us if
 

2731
01:26:47,159 --> 01:26:48,470
they're gonna do now so is behind us if
you look behind us she's on that

2732
01:26:48,470 --> 01:26:48,480
you look behind us she's on that
 

2733
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:50,169
you look behind us she's on that
platform that's why she

2734
01:26:50,169 --> 01:26:50,179
platform that's why she
 

2735
01:26:50,179 --> 01:26:52,610
platform that's why she
flies and then she has to go through the

2736
01:26:52,610 --> 01:26:52,620
flies and then she has to go through the
 

2737
01:26:52,620 --> 01:26:54,350
flies and then she has to go through the
Hoops but then as she's trying to go

2738
01:26:54,350 --> 01:26:54,360
Hoops but then as she's trying to go
 

2739
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:55,790
Hoops but then as she's trying to go
through the Hoops the white team has to

2740
01:26:55,790 --> 01:26:55,800
through the Hoops the white team has to
 

2741
01:26:55,800 --> 01:27:04,330
through the Hoops the white team has to
try and shoot her down

2742
01:27:04,330 --> 01:27:04,340

 

2743
01:27:04,340 --> 01:27:08,030

I think it might be smart to aim um for

2744
01:27:08,030 --> 01:27:08,040
I think it might be smart to aim um for
 

2745
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:10,189
I think it might be smart to aim um for
around the Hoops because they will

2746
01:27:10,189 --> 01:27:10,199
around the Hoops because they will
 

2747
01:27:10,199 --> 01:27:12,470
around the Hoops because they will
always go through the Hoops uh before

2748
01:27:12,470 --> 01:27:12,480
always go through the Hoops uh before
 

2749
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:15,950
always go through the Hoops uh before
that will go or Muna in in our case Muna

2750
01:27:15,950 --> 01:27:15,960
that will go or Muna in in our case Muna
 

2751
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:17,810
that will go or Muna in in our case Muna
will go through the red hoop on the very

2752
01:27:17,810 --> 01:27:17,820
will go through the red hoop on the very
 

2753
01:27:17,820 --> 01:27:20,030
will go through the red hoop on the very
left first then she will go through the

2754
01:27:20,030 --> 01:27:20,040
left first then she will go through the
 

2755
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:21,530
left first then she will go through the
three middle Hoops you will not go

2756
01:27:21,530 --> 01:27:21,540
three middle Hoops you will not go
 

2757
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:23,450
three middle Hoops you will not go
through the very right white hoop

2758
01:27:23,450 --> 01:27:23,460
through the very right white hoop
 

2759
01:27:23,460 --> 01:27:25,189
through the very right white hoop
because that one is only for the white

2760
01:27:25,189 --> 01:27:25,199
because that one is only for the white
 

2761
01:27:25,199 --> 01:27:27,890
because that one is only for the white
team players yeah yeah so try to maybe

2762
01:27:27,890 --> 01:27:27,900
team players yeah yeah so try to maybe
 

2763
01:27:27,900 --> 01:27:29,810
team players yeah yeah so try to maybe
aim at the middle I guess I don't know

2764
01:27:29,810 --> 01:27:29,820
aim at the middle I guess I don't know
 

2765
01:27:29,820 --> 01:27:31,370
aim at the middle I guess I don't know
what's the best way to aim to be honest

2766
01:27:31,370 --> 01:27:31,380
what's the best way to aim to be honest
 

2767
01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:34,129
what's the best way to aim to be honest
because I'm the flyer but you know

2768
01:27:34,129 --> 01:27:34,139
because I'm the flyer but you know
 

2769
01:27:34,139 --> 01:27:36,649
because I'm the flyer but you know

shot it's not a it's not gonna hit

2772
01:27:38,330 --> 01:27:38,340
shot it's not a it's not gonna hit
 

2773
01:27:38,340 --> 01:27:40,550
shot it's not a it's not gonna hit
direct so you wouldn't want to aim above

2774
01:27:40,550 --> 01:27:40,560
direct so you wouldn't want to aim above
 

2775
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:41,810
direct so you wouldn't want to aim above
wherever you're gonna shoot because the

2776
01:27:41,810 --> 01:27:41,820
wherever you're gonna shoot because the

as well yo yeah also I also realized
when I was in the practice round I might

5916
03:08:25,370 --> 03:08:25,380
when I was in the practice round I might
 

5917
03:08:25,380 --> 03:08:26,389
when I was in the practice round I might
have been going a little bit too early

5918
03:08:26,389 --> 03:08:26,399
have been going a little bit too early
 

5919
03:08:26,399 --> 03:08:28,250
have been going a little bit too early
when the red light faded out so I guess

5920
03:08:28,250 --> 03:08:28,260
when the red light faded out so I guess
 

5921
03:08:28,260 --> 03:08:29,750
when the red light faded out so I guess
that's what they meant like uh yeah yeah

5922
03:08:29,750 --> 03:08:29,760
that's what they meant like uh yeah yeah
 

5923
03:08:29,760 --> 03:08:31,070
that's what they meant like uh yeah yeah
yeah

5924
03:08:31,070 --> 03:08:31,080
yeah
 

5925
03:08:31,080 --> 03:08:33,170
yeah
I just yeah I had to ask to clarify

5926
03:08:33,170 --> 03:08:33,180
I just yeah I had to ask to clarify
 

5927
03:08:33,180 --> 03:08:34,250
I just yeah I had to ask to clarify
again

5928
03:08:34,250 --> 03:08:34,260
again
 

5929
03:08:34,260 --> 03:08:35,870
again
um

5930
03:08:35,870 --> 03:08:35,880
um
 

5931
03:08:35,880 --> 03:08:37,550
um
I do think that it's like a ping

5932
03:08:37,550 --> 03:08:37,560
I do think that it's like a ping
 

5933
03:08:37,560 --> 03:08:39,410
I do think that it's like a ping
Advantage thing too though because they

5934
03:08:39,410 --> 03:08:39,420
Advantage thing too though because they
 

5935
03:08:39,420 --> 03:08:41,150
Advantage thing too though because they
move first since they see it first and

5936
03:08:41,150 --> 03:08:41,160
move first since they see it first and
 

5937
03:08:41,160 --> 03:08:43,490
move first since they see it first and
then we can't even move like until we

5938
03:08:43,490 --> 03:08:43,500
then we can't even move like until we
 

5939
03:08:43,500 --> 03:08:45,710
then we can't even move like until we
have to stop it too I thought just in

5940
03:08:45,710 --> 03:08:45,720
have to stop it too I thought just in
 

5941
03:08:45,720 --> 03:08:47,450
have to stop it too I thought just in
case

5942
03:08:47,450 --> 03:08:47,460
case
 

5943
03:08:47,460 --> 03:08:50,090
case
so maybe if I do move when if I did move

5944
03:08:50,090 --> 03:08:50,100
so maybe if I do move when if I did move
 

5945
03:08:50,100 --> 03:08:51,650
so maybe if I do move when if I did move
when the red is fading out it doesn't

5946
03:08:51,650 --> 03:08:51,660
when the red is fading out it doesn't
 

5947
03:08:51,660 --> 03:08:53,570
when the red is fading out it doesn't
look like it because it would have

5948
03:08:53,570 --> 03:08:53,580
look like it because it would have
 

5949
03:08:53,580 --> 03:08:56,030
look like it because it would have
