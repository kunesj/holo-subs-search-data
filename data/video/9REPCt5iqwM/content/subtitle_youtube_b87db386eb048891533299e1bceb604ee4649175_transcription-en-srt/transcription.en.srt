3913
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:32,689
things that kind of like
made the situation a bit difficult so I

3914
01:39:32,689 --> 01:39:32,699
made the situation a bit difficult so I
 

3915
01:39:32,699 --> 01:39:35,030
made the situation a bit difficult so I
said can we just have an off collab

3916
01:39:35,030 --> 01:39:35,040
said can we just have an off collab
 

3917
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:37,270
said can we just have an off collab
instead

3918
01:39:37,270 --> 01:39:37,280
instead
 

3919
01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:40,910
instead
you know not so much of hanging out but

3920
01:39:40,910 --> 01:39:40,920
you know not so much of hanging out but
 

3921
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:43,010
you know not so much of hanging out but
just to off call them

3922
01:39:43,010 --> 01:39:43,020
just to off call them
 

3923
01:39:43,020 --> 01:39:45,050
just to off call them
and she said yeah okay

3924
01:39:45,050 --> 01:39:45,060
and she said yeah okay
 

3925
01:39:45,060 --> 01:39:48,229
and she said yeah okay
and then it seems like she kind of took

3926
01:39:48,229 --> 01:39:48,239
and then it seems like she kind of took
 

3927
01:39:48,239 --> 01:39:51,110
and then it seems like she kind of took
it as the whole thing was canceled

3928
01:39:51,110 --> 01:39:51,120
it as the whole thing was canceled
 

3929
01:39:51,120 --> 01:39:53,810
it as the whole thing was canceled
and that was like on the day before or

3930
01:39:53,810 --> 01:39:53,820
and that was like on the day before or
 

3931
01:39:53,820 --> 01:39:54,790
and that was like on the day before or
so

3932
01:39:54,790 --> 01:39:54,800
so
 

3933
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:58,930
so
and that's why she then ended up

3934
01:39:58,930 --> 01:39:58,940
and that's why she then ended up
 

3935
01:39:58,940 --> 01:40:02,570
and that's why she then ended up
adding another collab I guess kind of

3936
01:40:02,570 --> 01:40:02,580
