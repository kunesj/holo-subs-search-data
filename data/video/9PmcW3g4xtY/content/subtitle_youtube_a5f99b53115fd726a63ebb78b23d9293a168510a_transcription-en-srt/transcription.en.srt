longer than it should have especially in
 

1121
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:25,310
longer than it should have especially in
this one episode because a certain

1122
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:25,320
this one episode because a certain
 

1123
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,049

00:32:27,049 --> 00:32:27,059
someone
 

1125
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:33,409

you read at 300 words per minute it
 

5853
02:24:59,939 --> 02:25:01,969
you read at 300 words per minute it
would take 4 hours and 15 minutes which
