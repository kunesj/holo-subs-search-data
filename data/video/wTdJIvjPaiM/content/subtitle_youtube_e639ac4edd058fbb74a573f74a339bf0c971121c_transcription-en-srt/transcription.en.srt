that I guess by doing a ritual but Shion
must die in the ritual because the

692
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:57,900
must die in the ritual because the
 

693
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,930
must die in the ritual because the

02:09:15,780 --> 02:09:18,109
definitely was a choice so it didn't
overpower others or just the way it is

overpower others or just the way it is
 

4817
02:09:18,119 --> 02:09:20,930
overpower others or just the way it is
is anyone's guess

Dana's will could never form under

4822
02:09:25,250 --> 02:09:25,260
Dana's will could never form under
 

4823
02:09:25,260 --> 02:09:27,169
Dana's will could never form under

natural conditions
 

4825
02:09:27,179 --> 02:09:29,750
natural conditions
yeah sounds like that's probably the

4826
02:09:29,750 --> 02:09:29,760
yeah sounds like that's probably the
 

4827
02:09:29,760 --> 02:09:31,250
yeah sounds like that's probably the
case

4828
02:09:31,250 --> 02:09:31,260
case
 

4829
02:09:31,260 --> 02:09:34,189
case
so if Dana exists within all of us then

4830
02:09:34,189 --> 02:09:34,199

that Unity could potentially act as Dan
 

4839
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:42,530

you mean if everybody was like thinking

4842
02:09:45,169 --> 02:09:45,179
you mean if everybody was like thinking
 

4843
02:09:45,179 --> 02:09:47,209
you mean if everybody was like thinking
the exact same thing at the exact same

4844
02:09:47,209 --> 02:09:47,219
the exact same thing at the exact same
 

4845
02:09:47,219 --> 02:09:49,669
the exact same thing at the exact same
time come on there's no way we could

4846
02:09:49,669 --> 02:09:49,679
time come on there's no way we could
 

4847
02:09:49,679 --> 02:09:51,050
time come on there's no way we could
pull that off

4848
02:09:51,050 --> 02:09:51,060
pull that off
 

4849
02:09:51,060 --> 02:09:53,450
pull that off
um I know it's a long shot

4850
02:09:53,450 --> 02:09:53,460
um I know it's a long shot
 

4851
02:09:53,460 --> 02:09:55,490
um I know it's a long shot
but it might work

4852
02:09:55,490 --> 02:09:55,500
but it might work
 

4853
02:09:55,500 --> 02:09:57,770
but it might work
let's assume that's even possible for a

4854
02:09:57,770 --> 02:09:57,780
let's assume that's even possible for a
 

4855
02:09:57,780 --> 02:09:58,669
let's assume that's even possible for a
second

4856
02:09:58,669 --> 02:09:58,679
second
 

4857
02:09:58,679 --> 02:10:00,649
second
would it even be enough to fight back

4858
02:10:00,649 --> 02:10:00,659
would it even be enough to fight back

02:10:00,659 --> 02:10:03,109
would it even be enough to fight back
against Rena's great spirit how would we

4860
02:10:03,109 --> 02:10:03,119
against Rena's great spirit how would we
 

4861
02:10:03,119 --> 02:10:05,629
against Rena's great spirit how would we
know I've tested out if nothing else it

4862
02:10:05,629 --> 02:10:05,639
know I've tested out if nothing else it
 

4863
02:10:05,639 --> 02:10:07,430
know I've tested out if nothing else it
might be an option if we can't use the

4864
02:10:07,430 --> 02:10:07,440
might be an option if we can't use the
 

4865
02:10:07,440 --> 02:10:11,149
might be an option if we can't use the
Rena Salma

4866

04:34:42,119 --> 04:34:46,330

they finally smooched

9548
04:34:46,330 --> 04:34:46,340

 

9549
04:34:46,340 --> 04:34:49,429

it was it was fun I kind of made it easy

9550
04:34:49,429 --> 04:34:49,439
it was it was fun I kind of made it easy
 

9551
04:34:49,439 --> 04:34:50,750
it was it was fun I kind of made it easy
for me

9552
04:34:50,750 --> 04:34:50,760
for me
 

9553
04:34:50,760 --> 04:34:54,289
for me
by using story mode but that way it was

9554
04:34:54,289 --> 04:34:54,299
by using story mode but that way it was
 

9555
04:34:54,299 --> 04:34:55,910
by using story mode but that way it was
smoother

9556
04:34:55,910 --> 04:34:55,920
smoother
 

9557
04:34:55,920 --> 04:34:59,209
smoother
um I guess a normal or hard mode

9558
04:34:59,209 --> 04:34:59,219
um I guess a normal or hard mode
 

9559
04:34:59,219 --> 04:35:01,609
um I guess a normal or hard mode
you would have

9560
04:35:01,609 --> 04:35:01,619
you would have
 

9561
04:35:01,619 --> 04:35:05,330
you would have
felt uh it all as a bit more of a

9562
04:35:05,330 --> 04:35:05,340
felt uh it all as a bit more of a
 

9563
04:35:05,340 --> 04:35:07,310
felt uh it all as a bit more of a
challenge so if you're into that then go

9564
04:35:07,310 --> 04:35:07,320
challenge so if you're into that then go
 

9565
04:35:07,320 --> 04:35:09,349
challenge so if you're into that then go
for that but I think it's okay to just

9566
04:35:09,349 --> 04:35:09,359
for that but I think it's okay to just
 

9567
04:35:09,359 --> 04:35:13,310
for that but I think it's okay to just
enjoy the story too right yeah yeah

9568
04:35:13,310 --> 04:35:13,320

 

9569
04:35:13,320 --> 04:35:15,650

finished it in a good amount of time

9570
04:35:15,650 --> 04:35:15,660

finished it in a good amount of time
four and a half hours noise

9572
04:35:19,250 --> 04:35:19,260

9574
04:35:22,010 --> 04:35:22,020

9583
04:35:29,400 --> 04:35:33,170
one of the main characters
