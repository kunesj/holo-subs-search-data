about that too at at some point but I
 

3846
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:19,430
about that too at at some point but I

think I'm pretty sure it would be
 

3848
01:46:19,440 --> 01:46:21,669

if I did that um so I don't think I will

3853
01:46:33,470 --> 01:46:33,480
if I did that um so I don't think I will
 

3854
01:46:33,480 --> 01:46:37,350

ever attempt that even though it would

be quite the accomplishment
 

3858
01:46:40,440 --> 01:46:45,109
be quite the accomplishment

everything is proceeding with my

15165
06:45:47,548 --> 06:45:47,558
everything is proceeding with my
 

15166
06:45:47,558 --> 06:45:48,830
everything is proceeding with my
expectations I'm afraid the probability

15167
06:45:48,830 --> 06:45:48,840
expectations I'm afraid the probability
 

15168
06:45:48,840 --> 06:45:51,030
expectations I'm afraid the probability
of you winning is zero what the

15169
06:45:51,030 --> 06:45:51,040
of you winning is zero what the
 

15170
06:45:51,040 --> 06:45:52,468
of you winning is zero what the
expectation was that I'll take all your

15171
06:45:52,468 --> 06:45:52,478
expectation was that I'll take all your
 

15172

06:46:01,948 --> 06:46:01,958
one a I've seen the original form of
 

15176
06:46:01,958 --> 06:46:03,548
one a I've seen the original form of
that before somewhere but it looks

15177
06:46:03,548 --> 06:46:03,558
that before somewhere but it looks
 

15178
06:46:03,558 --> 06:46:06,030
that before somewhere but it looks
really

15179
06:46:06,030 --> 06:46:06,040

 

15180
06:46:06,040 --> 06:46:09,350

think if I was working out alone I would
 

17488
07:50:04,718 --> 07:50:07,110
think if I was working out alone I would
have um used my voic less and then

17489
07:50:07,110 --> 07:50:07,120
have um used my voic less and then
 

17490

have um used my voic less and then
therefore I could have probably saved

17496
07:50:12,318 --> 07:50:14,590
energy I'm probably could have gone
longer

17497
