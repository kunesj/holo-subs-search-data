00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,490

mine it with a sick touch that's why we

432
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:22,500
mine it with a sick touch that's why we
 

433
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,350
mine it with a sick touch that's why we
need a silk touch if I manage with a

434
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:24,360

um then uh I have it in my inventory I

438
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,000
um then uh I have it in my inventory I
 

439
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,590
um then uh I have it in my inventory I
guess and uh then let's say I jump off

440
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:33,600
guess and uh then let's say I jump off
 

441
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,689
guess and uh then let's say I jump off
of the Void

442
00:14:35,689 --> 00:14:35,699
of the Void
 

443
00:14:35,699 --> 00:14:38,269
of the Void
I I lose that one that I have in my

444
00:14:38,269 --> 00:14:38,279
I I lose that one that I have in my
 

445
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:40,490
I I lose that one that I have in my
inventory right but I will still have it

446
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:40,500
inventory right but I will still have it
 

447
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,370
inventory right but I will still have it
if I open up any other Ender Chest right

448
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:43,380
if I open up any other Ender Chest right
 

449
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,889
if I open up any other Ender Chest right
so I guess maybe it makes sense that I

450
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:45,899
so I guess maybe it makes sense that I
 

451
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:47,870
so I guess maybe it makes sense that I
made two but it would probably be

452
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:47,880
made two but it would probably be
 

453
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,750
made two but it would probably be
preferable if I didn't lose it

454
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:50,760
preferable if I didn't lose it
 

455
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,790
preferable if I didn't lose it
if I would just leave it somewhere in

456
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:52,800
if I would just leave it somewhere in
 

457
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,949
if I would just leave it somewhere in
the end but

458
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:54,959
the end but
 

459
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,710
the end but
I guess now that I'm a two we're fine if

460
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:57,720
I guess now that I'm a two we're fine if
 

461
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,569
I guess now that I'm a two we're fine if
I just jump off the void into the void

462
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:01,579
I just jump off the void into the void
 

463
00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:04,250
I just jump off the void into the void
with one in the chest in my inventory

464
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:04,260
with one in the chest in my inventory
 

465
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:07,850
with one in the chest in my inventory
that would still be fine right okay

466
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:07,860
that would still be fine right okay
 

467
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:13,009
that would still be fine right okay
so

let me put that there again because I

but she did great nonetheless
 

12809
05:55:14,040 --> 05:55:16,490
but she did great nonetheless
once we were on that Island she

12810
05:55:16,490 --> 05:55:16,500
once we were on that Island she
 

12811
05:55:16,500 --> 05:55:18,250
once we were on that Island she
did great

did great
 

12813
05:55:18,260 --> 05:55:21,470
did great
I mean I I didn't see what exactly she

12814
05:55:21,470 --> 05:55:21,480
I mean I I didn't see what exactly she
 

12815
05:55:21,480 --> 05:55:23,270
I mean I I didn't see what exactly she
was doing all the time because I was

12816
05:55:23,270 --> 05:55:23,280
was doing all the time because I was
 

12817
05:55:23,280 --> 05:55:25,788
was doing all the time because I was
focused on Surviving myself but you know

12818

focused on Surviving myself but you know
 

12819
05:55:25,798 --> 05:55:28,368
focused on Surviving myself but you know
once once we were all of that Island it

12820
05:55:28,368 --> 05:55:28,378
once once we were all of that Island it
 

12821
05:55:28,378 --> 05:55:30,670
once once we were all of that Island it
was good

12822
05:55:30,670 --> 05:55:30,680
was good
 

12823
05:55:30,680 --> 05:55:34,610
was good
she tried to help with her shovel I

12824
05:55:34,610 --> 05:55:34,620
she tried to help with her shovel I
 

12825
05:55:34,620 --> 05:55:37,128
she tried to help with her shovel I
think from what I've heard

12826
05:55:37,128 --> 05:55:37,138
think from what I've heard
 

12827
05:55:37,138 --> 05:55:39,410
think from what I've heard
yeah

12828
05:55:39,410 --> 05:55:39,420

05:55:42,230 --> 05:55:42,240
she did great
 

12831
05:55:42,240 --> 05:55:44,448
she did great
in the beginning was scuffed for all of

12832
05:55:44,448 --> 05:55:44,458
in the beginning was scuffed for all of
 

12833
05:55:44,458 --> 05:55:45,310
in the beginning was scuffed for all of
us

12834
05:55:45,310 --> 05:55:45,320
us
 

12835
05:55:45,320 --> 05:55:58,548
us
it was not her not her fault

12836
05:55:58,548 --> 05:55:58,558

 

12837
05:55:58,558 --> 05:56:01,330

so I hope she feels better

12838
05:56:01,330 --> 05:56:01,340
so I hope she feels better
 

12839
05:56:01,340 --> 05:56:04,128
so I hope she feels better
about it now

12840
05:56:04,128 --> 05:56:04,138
about it now
 

12841
05:56:04,138 --> 05:56:07,548
about it now
better than yesterday

12842
05:56:07,548 --> 05:56:07,558

 

12843
05:56:07,558 --> 05:56:14,170

foreign

12844
05:56:14,170 --> 05:56:14,180

 

12845
05:56:14,180 --> 05:56:18,470

I think that will like clear itself up

12846
05:56:18,470 --> 05:56:18,480
I think that will like clear itself up
 

12847
05:56:18,480 --> 05:56:20,090
I think that will like clear itself up
once you play a little bit of Minecraft

12848
05:56:20,090 --> 05:56:20,100
once you play a little bit of Minecraft
 

12849
05:56:20,100 --> 05:56:21,948
once you play a little bit of Minecraft
then you will be able to recognize

12850
05:56:21,948 --> 05:56:21,958
then you will be able to recognize
 

12851
05:56:21,958 --> 05:56:23,030
then you will be able to recognize
what's

12852
05:56:23,030 --> 05:56:23,040
what's
 

12853
05:56:23,040 --> 05:56:25,128
what's
something that someone built and what's

12854
05:56:25,128 --> 05:56:25,138
something that someone built and what's
 

12855
05:56:25,138 --> 05:56:27,830
something that someone built and what's
something that is uh generated naturally

12856
05:56:27,830 --> 05:56:27,840
something that is uh generated naturally
 

12857
05:56:27,840 --> 05:56:30,048
something that is uh generated naturally
what belongs to someone and what doesn't

12858
05:56:30,048 --> 05:56:30,058
what belongs to someone and what doesn't
 

12859
05:56:30,058 --> 05:56:32,448
what belongs to someone and what doesn't
belong to someone I think that'll be

12860
05:56:32,448 --> 05:56:32,458
belong to someone I think that'll be
 

12861
05:56:32,458 --> 05:56:36,350
belong to someone I think that'll be
much easier to recognize because

12862
05:56:36,350 --> 05:56:36,360
much easier to recognize because
 

12863
05:56:36,360 --> 05:56:38,090
much easier to recognize because
um yeah

12864
05:56:38,090 --> 05:56:38,100
um yeah
 

12865
05:56:38,100 --> 05:56:40,070
um yeah
I mean you will you will see the

12866
05:56:40,070 --> 05:56:40,080
I mean you will you will see the
 

12867
05:56:40,080 --> 05:56:42,110
I mean you will you will see the
difference between a tree that has been

12868
05:56:42,110 --> 05:56:42,120
difference between a tree that has been
 

12869
05:56:42,120 --> 05:56:45,590
difference between a tree that has been
built by someone manually and a tree

12870
05:56:45,590 --> 05:56:45,600
built by someone manually and a tree
 

12871
05:56:45,600 --> 05:56:49,610
built by someone manually and a tree
that is a normal tree

12872
05:56:49,610 --> 05:56:49,620

 

12873
05:56:49,620 --> 05:56:52,190

so I think that will come soon soon

12874
05:56:52,190 --> 05:56:52,200
so I think that will come soon soon
 

12875
05:56:52,200 --> 05:56:54,250
so I think that will come soon soon
after a bit more of a general

12876
05:56:54,250 --> 05:56:54,260
after a bit more of a general
 

12877
05:56:54,260 --> 05:56:57,110
after a bit more of a general
understanding yeah she is too hard on

12878
05:56:57,110 --> 05:56:57,120
understanding yeah she is too hard on
 

12879
05:56:57,120 --> 05:56:59,750
understanding yeah she is too hard on
herself no no I don't think any I I

12880
05:56:59,750 --> 05:56:59,760
herself no no I don't think any I I
 

12881
05:56:59,760 --> 05:57:01,970
herself no no I don't think any I I
think the only people who cared about

12882
05:57:01,970 --> 05:57:01,980
think the only people who cared about
 

12883
05:57:01,980 --> 05:57:05,208
think the only people who cared about
the tree thing were the chat

12884
05:57:05,208 --> 05:57:05,218
the tree thing were the chat
 

12885
05:57:05,218 --> 05:57:09,190
the tree thing were the chat
because the chant always goes absolutely

12886
05:57:09,190 --> 05:57:09,200
because the chant always goes absolutely
 

12887
05:57:09,200 --> 05:57:14,570
because the chant always goes absolutely
insane even if like one piece of a

12888
05:57:14,570 --> 05:57:14,580
insane even if like one piece of a
 

12889
05:57:14,580 --> 05:57:17,810
insane even if like one piece of a
stairwell has been

12890
05:57:17,810 --> 05:57:17,820
stairwell has been
 

12891
05:57:17,820 --> 05:57:22,128
stairwell has been

06:31:21,350 --> 06:31:21,360
birthdays haven't been feeling that
 

14067

birthdays haven't been feeling that
special at all the past years but yeah

14068
06:31:24,830 --> 06:31:24,840
special at all the past years but yeah
 

14069
06:31:24,840 --> 06:31:27,890
special at all the past years but yeah
it is what it is

14070
06:31:27,890 --> 06:31:27,900
it is what it is
 

14071
06:31:27,900 --> 06:31:31,070
it is what it is
I think there's still people who care

14072
06:31:31,070 --> 06:31:31,080
I think there's still people who care
 

14073
06:31:31,080 --> 06:31:34,368
I think there's still people who care
about you and me every day

14074
06:31:34,368 --> 06:31:34,378
about you and me every day
 

14075

have a party like a birthday party it

14102
06:32:07,490 --> 06:32:07,500
have a party like a birthday party it
 

14103
06:32:07,500 --> 06:32:10,010
have a party like a birthday party it
would feel much more like a birthday or

14104
06:32:10,010 --> 06:32:10,020
would feel much more like a birthday or
 

14105
06:32:10,020 --> 06:32:12,048
would feel much more like a birthday or
you know like having people there in

14106
06:32:12,048 --> 06:32:12,058
you know like having people there in
 

14107
06:32:12,058 --> 06:32:15,288
you know like having people there in
person uh in person eating cake together

14108
06:32:15,288 --> 06:32:15,298
person uh in person eating cake together
 

14109
06:32:15,298 --> 06:32:20,150
person uh in person eating cake together
in person giving presents and

14110
06:32:20,150 --> 06:32:20,160
in person giving presents and
 

14111
06:32:20,160 --> 06:32:22,128
in person giving presents and
I guess that ultimately makes it feel

14112
06:32:22,128 --> 06:32:22,138
I guess that ultimately makes it feel
 

14113
06:32:22,138 --> 06:32:23,510
I guess that ultimately makes it feel
more like a birthday but I haven't been

14114
06:32:23,510 --> 06:32:23,520
more like a birthday but I haven't been

more like a birthday but I haven't been
doing that for years and partially

14116
06:32:26,810 --> 06:32:26,820
doing that for years and partially
 

14117
06:32:26,820 --> 06:32:28,368
doing that for years and partially
because I don't want to be around so

14118
06:32:28,368 --> 06:32:28,378
because I don't want to be around so
 

14119
