something ja what if people had children

3506
01:43:06,830 --> 01:43:06,840
something ja what if people had children
 

3507
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:08,870
something ja what if people had children
just to make them overseer and spare

3508
01:43:08,870 --> 01:43:08,880
just to make them overseer and spare
 

3509
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:14,149
just to make them overseer and spare
themselves

3510
01:43:14,149 --> 01:43:14,159

 

3511
01:43:14,159 --> 01:43:19,070

bro but surely that was a minimum age

3512
01:43:19,070 --> 01:43:19,080

 

3513
01:43:19,080 --> 01:43:22,550

right and you'd have to grow your child

3514
01:43:22,550 --> 01:43:22,560
right and you'd have to grow your child
 

3515
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:25,229
right and you'd have to grow your child
first

3516
01:43:25,229 --> 01:43:25,239

 

3517
01:43:25,239 --> 01:43:27,589

right and then you would be so attached

3518
01:43:27,589 --> 01:43:27,599
right and then you would be so attached
 

3519
01:43:27,599 --> 01:43:29,109
right and then you would be so attached
to it that maybe you didn't want to do

3520
01:43:29,109 --> 01:43:29,119
to it that maybe you didn't want to do
 

3521
01:43:29,119 --> 01:43:31,589
to it that maybe you didn't want to do
that

3522
01:43:31,589 --> 01:43:31,599

 

3523
01:43:31,599 --> 01:43:35,550

anymore hopefully well I don't know

3524
01:43:35,550 --> 01:43:35,560
anymore hopefully well I don't know
 

3525
01:43:35,560 --> 01:43:37,990
anymore hopefully well I don't know
maybe it makes it worse when they grow

3526
01:43:37,990 --> 01:43:38,000
maybe it makes it worse when they grow
 

3527
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,109
maybe it makes it worse when they grow
up because then you you're probably more

3528
01:43:40,109 --> 01:43:40,119
up because then you you're probably more
 

3529
01:43:40,119 --> 01:43:43,109
up because then you you're probably more
attached cuz you went through so much

3530
01:43:43,109 --> 01:43:43,119
attached cuz you went through so much
 

3531
01:43:43,119 --> 01:43:47,550
attached cuz you went through so much
together and saw so many deaths

3532
01:43:47,550 --> 01:43:47,560
together and saw so many deaths
 

3533
01:43:47,560 --> 01:43:50,149
together and saw so many deaths
together running against a baby

interesting
sure so the experiment was

4604
02:18:10,750 --> 02:18:10,760
sure so the experiment was
 

4605
02:18:10,760 --> 02:18:13,950
sure so the experiment was
to have the like

4606
02:18:13,950 --> 02:18:13,960
to have the like
 

4607
02:18:13,960 --> 02:18:16,429

people sacrifice somebody but because
 

4609
02:18:16,439 --> 02:18:18,270
people sacrifice somebody but because
they didn't want to choose they made it

4610
02:18:18,270 --> 02:18:18,280
they didn't want to choose they made it
 

4611
02:18:18,280 --> 02:18:23,070
they didn't want to choose they made it
a a voting thing

4612
02:18:23,070 --> 02:18:23,080

 

4613
02:18:23,080 --> 02:18:26,070

and for the longest time they voted for

4614
02:18:26,070 --> 02:18:26,080
and for the longest time they voted for
 

4615
02:18:26,080 --> 02:18:28,589
and for the longest time they voted for
people as if it was a presidential

4616
02:18:28,589 --> 02:18:28,599
people as if it was a presidential
 

4617
02:18:28,599 --> 02:18:32,830
people as if it was a presidential
election and people died one after

4618
02:18:32,830 --> 02:18:32,840
election and people died one after
 

4619
02:18:32,840 --> 02:18:34,910
election and people died one after
another and then when there were only

4620
02:18:34,910 --> 02:18:34,920
another and then when there were only
 

4621
02:18:34,920 --> 02:18:37,549
another and then when there were only
five people

4622
02:18:37,549 --> 02:18:37,559

 

4623
02:18:37,559 --> 02:18:40,070

left wait so wait what with the five

4624
02:18:40,070 --> 02:18:40,080
left wait so wait what with the five
 

4625
02:18:40,080 --> 02:18:42,030
left wait so wait what with the five
people

4626
02:18:42,030 --> 02:18:42,040
people
 

4627
02:18:42,040 --> 02:18:45,070
people
left one person killed four of them or

4628
02:18:45,070 --> 02:18:45,080
left one person killed four of them or
 

4629
02:18:45,080 --> 02:18:48,830
left one person killed four of them or
what or or they were killed by the

4630
02:18:48,830 --> 02:18:48,840
what or or they were killed by the
 

4631
02:18:48,840 --> 02:18:52,070
what or or they were killed by the
system female I miss the female dorm

4632
02:18:52,070 --> 02:18:52,080
system female I miss the female dorm
 

4633
02:18:52,080 --> 02:18:56,150
system female I miss the female dorm
where are the

4634
02:18:56,150 --> 02:18:56,160

 

4635
02:18:56,160 --> 02:18:59,549

females oh females making me feel things

4636
02:18:59,549 --> 02:18:59,559
females oh females making me feel things
 

4637
02:18:59,559 --> 02:19:03,750
females oh females making me feel things
oh they they okay they should look good

4638
02:19:03,750 --> 02:19:03,760
oh they they okay they should look good
 

4639
02:19:03,760 --> 02:19:06,709
oh they they okay they should look good
mhm

4640
02:19:06,709 --> 02:19:06,719
mhm
 

4641
02:19:06,719 --> 02:19:09,629
mhm
oh and then only on one was left and

4642
02:19:09,629 --> 02:19:09,639
oh and then only on one was left and
 

4643
02:19:09,639 --> 02:19:11,910
oh and then only on one was left and
that one was able to hear this

4644
02:19:11,910 --> 02:19:11,920
that one was able to hear this
 

4645
02:19:11,920 --> 02:19:14,070
that one was able to hear this
solution because the system maybe

4646
02:19:14,070 --> 02:19:14,080
solution because the system maybe
 

4647
02:19:14,080 --> 02:19:16,230
solution because the system maybe
recognized that only one person was left

4648
02:19:16,230 --> 02:19:16,240
recognized that only one person was left
 

4649
02:19:16,240 --> 02:19:19,190
recognized that only one person was left
so what's the point and it

4650
02:19:19,190 --> 02:19:19,200
so what's the point and it
 

4651
02:19:19,200 --> 02:19:21,709
so what's the point and it
automatically made that happen happened

4652
02:19:21,709 --> 02:19:21,719
automatically made that happen happened
 

4653
02:19:21,719 --> 02:19:24,150
automatically made that happen happened
oh all five

02:20:03,309 --> 02:20:03,319

 

4681
02:20:03,319 --> 02:20:06,429

02:21:29,200 --> 02:21:31,429
don't sound very traumatized that's
exactly the problem now let's get on

4734
02:21:31,429 --> 02:21:31,439
exactly the problem now let's get on
 

4735
02:21:31,439 --> 02:21:33,670
exactly the problem now let's get on
with this if you ask me that's exactly

with this if you ask me that's exactly
 

4737
02:21:33,680 --> 02:21:36,190
with this if you ask me that's exactly
the problem wait wait people should know

4738
02:21:36,190 --> 02:21:36,200
the problem wait wait people should know
 

4739
02:21:36,200 --> 02:21:38,030
the problem wait wait people should know
what happened oh that's the one that

4740
02:21:38,030 --> 02:21:38,040
what happened oh that's the one that
 

4741
02:21:38,040 --> 02:21:40,110
what happened oh that's the one that
survives I guess if there's anyone out

yeah but like what for it to become
 

5017
02:28:45,880 --> 02:28:48,230

more right but them saying that is

02:28:54,349 --> 02:28:54,359
more right but them saying that is
 

5023
02:28:54,359 --> 02:28:56,230
more right but them saying that is
almost like saying we are not

almost like saying we are not
 

5025
02:28:56,240 --> 02:28:57,790

anybody they should have just phrased it
 

5029
02:29:00,120 --> 02:29:01,349

differently and then they would have all
 

5031
02:29:01,359 --> 02:29:03,070
differently and then they would have all
been free but I guess they just said we

5032
02:29:03,070 --> 02:29:03,080
been free but I guess they just said we
 

5033
02:29:03,080 --> 02:29:04,469
been free but I guess they just said we
don't want to choose it anymore so it

5034
02:29:04,469 --> 02:29:04,479
don't want to choose it anymore so it
