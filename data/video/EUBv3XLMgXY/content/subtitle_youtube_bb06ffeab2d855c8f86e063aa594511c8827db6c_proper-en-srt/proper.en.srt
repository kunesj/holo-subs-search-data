1
00:00:05,289 --> 00:00:09,326
​​​ ​It's so hard to resist​ ​​
​​ ​the tempting smells​ ​​
​​ ​of the food stalls!​ ​​

2
00:00:09,326 --> 00:00:11,228
​​​ ​Let's eat over there.​ ​​

3
00:00:11,228 --> 00:00:13,163
​​​ ​It looks less crowded.​ ​​

4
00:00:18,202 --> 00:00:19,136
​​​ ​(munch)​ ​​

5
00:00:20,137 --> 00:00:21,305
​​​ ​Mmm!​ ​​

6
00:00:21,305 --> 00:00:23,507
​​​ ​So good!​ ​​

7
00:00:23,507 --> 00:00:27,177
​​​ ​There's nothing like​ ​​
​​ ​eating good food​ ​​
​​ ​under the open sky!​ ​​

8
00:00:27,644 --> 00:00:29,446
​​​ ​Do you want one, too?​ ​​

9
00:00:31,081 --> 00:00:32,816
​​​ ​Here you...​ ​​

10
00:00:32,816 --> 00:00:34,051
​​​ ​Not!​ ​​

11
00:00:35,519 --> 00:00:37,688
​​​ ​Just kidding! Here.​ ​​

12
00:00:37,688 --> 00:00:39,690
​​​ ​Open wide!​ ​​

13
00:00:40,357 --> 00:00:43,027
​​​ ​Good, right? Hee-hee!​ ​​

14
00:00:44,094 --> 00:00:47,064
​​​ ​I've always​ ​​
​​ ​loved your smile.​ ​​

15
00:00:47,064 --> 00:00:49,867
​​​ ​So keep smiling​ ​​
​​ ​by my side, okay?​ ​​

16
00:00:56,073 --> 00:01:00,210
​​​ ​Phew. We visited​ ​​
​​ ​a lot of stalls.​ ​​

17
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,614
​​​ ​We ate lots of food, too.​ ​​

18
00:01:03,614 --> 00:01:05,516
​​​ ​Yakisoba,​ ​​

19
00:01:05,516 --> 00:01:07,551
​​​ ​candy apples,​ ​​

20
00:01:07,551 --> 00:01:09,486
​​​ ​chocolate-covered​ ​​
​​ ​bananas...​ ​​

21
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:12,556
​​​ ​They were all​ ​​
​​ ​so delicious.​ ​​

22
00:01:13,123 --> 00:01:15,025
​​​ ​After we rest for a bit,​ ​​

23
00:01:15,025 --> 00:01:17,127
​​​ ​wanna check out some​ ​​
​​ ​of the game stalls?​ ​​

24
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:22,099
​​​ ​Like the shooting​ ​​
​​ ​game, or the ring toss!​ ​​

25
00:01:23,467 --> 00:01:24,501
​​​ ​...Hm?​ ​​

26
00:01:24,968 --> 00:01:26,336
​​​ ​What is it?​ ​​

27
00:01:27,237 --> 00:01:29,273
​​​ ​It's almost time?​ ​​

28
00:01:29,273 --> 00:01:30,941
​​​ ​For what?​ ​​

29
00:01:33,377 --> 00:01:35,312
​​​ ​Whoa!​ ​​

30
00:01:35,312 --> 00:01:37,981
​​​ ​So beautiful!​ ​​

31
00:01:38,782 --> 00:01:42,019
​​​ ​Hey, let's find​ ​​
​​ ​somewhere where we​ ​​
​​ ​can get a better view!​ ​​

32
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:50,794
​​​ ​Phew...​ ​​

33
00:01:51,261 --> 00:01:54,164
​​​ ​What a nice breeze.​ ​​

34
00:01:54,965 --> 00:01:59,002
​​​ ​Perfect for relaxing​ ​​
​​ ​in the evening​ ​​
​​ ​cool after a bath.​ ​​

35
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,442
​​​ ​In summer​ ​​

36
00:02:05,776 --> 00:02:09,446
​​​ ​there are lots of lively​ ​​
​​ ​and exciting things,​ ​​

37
00:02:09,446 --> 00:02:11,782
​​​ ​but I also love​ ​​

38
00:02:11,782 --> 00:02:14,852
​​​ ​quiet moments like this.​ ​​

39
00:02:15,752 --> 00:02:18,655
​​​ ​Hm? What's the matter?​ ​​

40
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:24,495
​​​ ​What do you mean,​ ​​
​​ ​I look alluring​ ​​
​​ ​in my yukata?!​ ​​

41
00:02:24,495 --> 00:02:27,397
​​​ ​Where did that come​ ​​
​​ ​from all of a sudden?!​ ​​

42
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:31,168
​​​ ​Gosh,​ ​​
​​ ​now I'm flustered...​ ​​

43
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:35,072
​​​ ​Oh, th-that's right!​ ​​

44
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:36,907
​​​ ​We have watermelon!​ ​​

45
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:38,976
​​​ ​I'll go​ ​​
​​ ​cut us some slices!​ ​​

46
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:48,285
​​​ ​Mm!​ ​​
​​ ​So delectably sweet!​ ​​

47
00:02:48,285 --> 00:02:51,355
​​​ ​Candy apples are a​ ​​
​​ ​little hard to eat, though.​ ​​

48
00:02:51,355 --> 00:02:53,957
​​​ ​Gotta take care​ ​​
​​ ​not to drop it...​ ​​

49
00:02:54,691 --> 00:02:55,726
​​​ ​Hm?​ ​​

50
00:02:56,193 --> 00:02:59,296
​​​ ​My, why are you​ ​​
​​ ​staring at me like that?​ ​​

51
00:02:59,296 --> 00:03:00,764
​​​ ​Hee-hee.​ ​​

52
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:02,966
​​​ ​Is it because​ ​​
​​ ​you want a taste?​ ​​

53
00:03:03,834 --> 00:03:05,502
​​​ ​Really?​ ​​

54
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:09,540
​​​ ​Gosh, I've already​ ​​
​​ ​started eating it, though.​ ​​

55
00:03:10,307 --> 00:03:12,776
​​​ ​But if you don't​ ​​
​​ ​mind that, then sure.​ ​​

56
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,546
​​​ ​Open your mouth.​ ​​

57
00:03:15,546 --> 00:03:16,313
​​​ ​Ahh...​ ​​

58
00:03:16,313 --> 00:03:16,947
​​​ ​Mm!​ ​​

59
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:18,248
​​​ ​Hee-hee!​ ​​

60
00:03:18,815 --> 00:03:21,752
​​​ ​Too bad! None for you!​ ​​

61
00:03:22,686 --> 00:03:26,256
​​​ ​Besides, wouldn't​ ​​
​​ ​you like something​ ​​
​​ ​even sweeter?​ ​​

62
00:03:26,823 --> 00:03:28,192
​​​ ​Hee-hee!​ ​​

63
00:03:28,192 --> 00:03:30,661
​​​ ​You're blushing​ ​​
​​ ​from head to toe!​ ​​

64
00:03:37,034 --> 00:03:39,203
​​​ ​I'm back!​ ​​

65
00:03:39,836 --> 00:03:43,807
​​​ ​Look! I got some​ ​​
​​ ​takoyaki from that​ ​​
​​ ​stall over there!​ ​​

66
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:46,376
​​​ ​Gotta be careful,​ ​​
​​ ​since it's still hot.​ ​​

67
00:03:46,376 --> 00:03:48,779
​​​ ​So, I'll blow...​ ​​

68
00:03:48,779 --> 00:03:51,014
​​​ ​Fuu, fuu...​ ​​

69
00:03:51,014 --> 00:03:56,086
​​​ ​Till it's cool, just cool,​ ​​
​​ ​then into the mouth.​ ​​

70
00:03:58,922 --> 00:04:00,390
​​​ ​Nice.​ ​​

71
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:02,859
​​​ ​You want one too?​ ​​
​​ ​Here you go!​ ​​

72
00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:04,494
​​​ ​Blow on it first, okay?​ ​​

73
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,396
​​​ ​Yeah! Just like that.​ ​​

74
00:04:06,396 --> 00:04:09,399
​​​ ​Till it's cool, just cool...​ ​​

75
00:04:10,567 --> 00:04:12,269
​​​ ​Nice.​ ​​

76
00:04:12,936 --> 00:04:16,273
​​​ ​Man, the stalls​ ​​
​​ ​are so fun!​ ​​

77
00:04:16,273 --> 00:04:19,042
​​​ ​Hey! That one​ ​​
​​ ​looks like it's got​ ​​
​​ ​some good stuff too!​ ​​

78
00:04:19,042 --> 00:04:20,811
​​​ ​Let's go check it out!​ ​​

79
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:31,755
​​​ ​I picked a yukata​ ​​
​​ ​I thought you would like.​ ​​

80
00:04:31,755 --> 00:04:33,557
​​​ ​What do you think?​ ​​

81
00:04:33,557 --> 00:04:35,826
​​​ ​It's lovely?​ ​​

82
00:04:35,826 --> 00:04:38,028
​​​ ​Gosh. Heh-heh.​ ​​

83
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:39,263
​​​ ​I see.​ ​​

84
00:04:39,263 --> 00:04:41,331
​​​ ​So I look good in it?​ ​​

85
00:04:42,799 --> 00:04:44,001
​​​ ​Whoa!​ ​​

86
00:04:44,001 --> 00:04:46,570
​​​ ​The fireworks​ ​​
​​ ​are beautiful!​ ​​

87
00:04:48,805 --> 00:04:52,175
​​​ ​Such lovely fireworks.​ ​​

88
00:04:53,143 --> 00:04:54,578
​​​ ​Hey...​ ​​

89
00:04:54,578 --> 00:04:58,782
​​​ ​You said I looked​ ​​
​​ ​lovely just now.​ ​​

90
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:01,918
​​​ ​Between the​ ​​
​​ ​fireworks and me,​ ​​

91
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:04,755
​​​ ​which is lovelier?​ ​​

92
00:05:06,023 --> 00:05:10,127
​​​ ​Hee-hee. Oh, I know!​ ​​

93
00:05:10,127 --> 00:05:13,330
​​​ ​I'll always be​ ​​
​​ ​number one to you.​ ​​

94
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:18,101
​​​ ​And you'll always be​ ​​
​​ ​my number one, too!​ ​​

95
00:05:24,508 --> 00:05:28,078
​​​ ​Gotta say, pretty nice​ ​​
​​ ​fireworks up there.​ ​​

96
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:30,347
​​​ ​But they're​ ​​
​​ ​also pretty loud.​ ​​

97
00:05:30,347 --> 00:05:33,450
​​​ ​At least I'm not​ ​​
​​ ​gonna nod off​ ​​
​​ ​with this much noise.​ ​​

98
00:05:34,351 --> 00:05:37,754
​​​ ​You know, it would​ ​​
​​ ​take someone​ ​​
​​ ​really shameless​ ​​

99
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:41,858
​​​ ​to fall asleep,​ ​​
​​ ​right here...​ ​​

100
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:45,529
​​​ ​right now...​ ​​

101
00:05:48,298 --> 00:05:49,333
​​​ ​Huh?!​ ​​

102
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:50,734
​​​ ​No, I wasn't sleeping!​ ​​

103
00:05:50,734 --> 00:05:59,476
​​​ ​Nonono, I'm awake, I'm​ ​​
​​ ​awake! It's fine! I'm fine,​ ​​
​​ ​I'm fine... I'm... fine...​ ​​

104
00:06:02,312 --> 00:06:03,580
​​​ ​Ow!​ ​​

105
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,583
​​​ ​Who the heck is playing​ ​​
​​ ​with a beach ball here?!​ ​​

106
00:06:07,217 --> 00:06:09,052
​​​ ​Who hit me?!​ ​​

107
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:15,158
​​​ ​Gotcha!​ ​​

108
00:06:15,158 --> 00:06:16,727
​​​ ​There!​ ​​

109
00:06:16,727 --> 00:06:19,429
​​​ ​Hi-yah-yah-yah-yah!​ ​​

110
00:06:19,429 --> 00:06:22,866
​​​ ​Phew. I'm getting​ ​​
​​ ​a bit tired.​ ​​

111
00:06:22,866 --> 00:06:25,168
​​​ ​What? I'm over-excited?​ ​​

112
00:06:25,168 --> 00:06:29,272
​​​ ​I guess my inner​ ​​
​​ ​kid came out...​ ​​

113
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,908
​​​ ​But hey, we're​ ​​
​​ ​at a festival!​ ​​

114
00:06:31,908 --> 00:06:34,177
​​​ ​What better place to​ ​​
​​ ​let loose and have fun?​ ​​

115
00:06:34,177 --> 00:06:37,848
​​​ ​On that note, we're​ ​​
​​ ​not leaving till we've​ ​​
​​ ​eaten at every stall!​ ​​

116
00:06:37,848 --> 00:06:41,952
​​​ ​Anyway, we can cool​ ​​
​​ ​down a bit with this.​ ​​

117
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,921
​​​ ​This isn't that tiring!​ ​​

118
00:06:44,921 --> 00:06:47,057
​​​ ​It's basically the​ ​​
​​ ​same as a break!​ ​​

119
00:06:47,424 --> 00:06:51,895
​​​ ​And of course,​ ​​
​​ ​we're aiming for the​ ​​
​​ ​biggest prize, right?​ ​​

120
00:06:57,901 --> 00:07:00,604
​​​ ​Hiii, everyone!​ ​​
​​ ​Guess where I am!​ ​​

121
00:07:00,604 --> 00:07:02,406
​​​ ​Look! Look​ ​​
​​ ​what I'm wearing!​ ​​

122
00:07:02,406 --> 00:07:04,174
​​​ ​That should be a hint.​ ​​

123
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:05,175
​​​ ​Did you guess?​ ​​

124
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:06,143
​​​ ​I'm in Japan!!​ ​​

125
00:07:06,143 --> 00:07:09,012
​​​ ​Hehe, my outfit​ ​​
​​ ​is cute, right?​ ​​

126
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,914
​​​ ​I just wanted to​ ​​
​​ ​show you before I leave!​ ​​

127
00:07:10,914 --> 00:07:12,682
​​​ ​We're about to​ ​​
​​ ​go to a festival!​ ​​

128
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:15,118
​​​ ​Look, I even​ ​​
​​ ​have a cute bag!​ ​​

129
00:07:15,118 --> 00:07:18,889
​​​ ​And the yukata​ ​​
​​ ​has flowers on it…​ ​​

130
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:21,525
​​​ ​I can't believe it!​ ​​
​​ ​I'm in Japan!!​ ​​

131
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:23,326
​​​ ​Yippee!!​ ​​

132
00:07:30,767 --> 00:07:31,768
​​​ ​Heh-heh.​ ​​

133
00:07:31,768 --> 00:07:34,504
​​​ ​These sparklers​ ​​
​​ ​are so pretty.​ ​​

134
00:07:35,105 --> 00:07:39,042
​​​ ​Wanna bet on​ ​​
​​ ​whose lasts longer?​ ​​

135
00:07:40,177 --> 00:07:43,180
​​​ ​All right! I'm gonna win!​ ​​

136
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,549
​​​ ​Come on...​ ​​

137
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,319
​​​ ​Wah! Oh, no!​ ​​

138
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:53,457
​​​ ​Hey! Hey! Drop yours​ ​​
​​ ​already! C'mon!​ ​​

139
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:57,027
​​​ ​Ahh! How come?!​ ​​

140
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,529
​​​ ​Aw, no fair!​ ​​

141
00:07:59,529 --> 00:08:02,365
​​​ ​That doesn't​ ​​
​​ ​count! One more!​ ​​

142
00:08:08,338 --> 00:08:11,441
​​​ ​Ah! I finally found​ ​​
​​ ​you, dear human!​ ​​

143
00:08:11,441 --> 00:08:14,044
​​​ ​You must hurry!​ ​​

144
00:08:14,044 --> 00:08:16,580
​​​ ​The fireworks​ ​​
​​ ​will start soon!​ ​​

145
00:08:17,681 --> 00:08:22,886
​​​ ​Huh? You think​ ​​
​​ ​my yukata is cute?​ ​​

146
00:08:23,887 --> 00:08:26,990
​​​ ​Heh-heh...​ ​​
​​ ​You think so?​ ​​

147
00:08:28,358 --> 00:08:29,125
​​​ ​Wait!​ ​​

148
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,827
​​​ ​Now is not​ ​​
​​ ​the time for this!​ ​​

149
00:08:30,827 --> 00:08:32,095
​​​ ​We must make haste!​ ​​

150
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:36,766
​​​ ​I will let you have​ ​​
​​ ​a good look later.​ ​​

151
00:08:37,868 --> 00:08:41,671
​​​ ​For now, let us​ ​​
​​ ​enjoy the fireworks.​ ​​

152
00:08:42,405 --> 00:08:43,673
​​​ ​Come on, let's go!​ ​​

153
00:08:51,882 --> 00:08:54,684
​​​ ​Hee-hee-hee, I had​ ​​
​​ ​so much fun today!​ ​​

154
00:08:54,684 --> 00:08:57,554
​​​ ​The Ramune we drank​ ​​
​​ ​together was so tasty,​ ​​

155
00:08:57,554 --> 00:09:00,190
​​​ ​and the fireworks​ ​​
​​ ​were really pretty!​ ​​

156
00:09:01,892 --> 00:09:05,862
​​​ ​Oh, no! The strap​ ​​
​​ ​on my geta snapped!​ ​​

157
00:09:05,862 --> 00:09:10,333
​​​ ​Am I hurt? No, I'm fine.​ ​​

158
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:13,870
​​​ ​Hmm... But how​ ​​
​​ ​am I gonna walk​ ​​
​​ ​home like this?​ ​​

159
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:17,207
​​​ ​I didn't bring extra​ ​​
​​ ​footwear or anything...​ ​​

160
00:09:17,207 --> 00:09:18,808
​​​ ​Hey, hey!​ ​​
​​ ​How about you give​ ​​
​​ ​me a piggy-back ride?​ ​​

161
00:09:19,676 --> 00:09:22,712
​​​ ​Oh! You can carry me​ ​​
​​ ​in your arms, too!​ ​​

162
00:09:25,582 --> 00:09:29,319
​​​ ​Take me home like this! ♪​ ​​

163
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:35,025
​​​ ​Oh?​ ​​

164
00:09:35,025 --> 00:09:38,228
​​​ ​How peculiar, I daresay.​ ​​

165
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:44,501
​​​ ​I really did find​ ​​
​​ ​a tasty-looking​ ​​

166
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,870
​​​ ​shaved ice stall,​ ​​
​​ ​I daresay!​ ​​

167
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,739
​​​ ​And I daresay​ ​​
​​ ​I'd already decided​ ​​

168
00:09:49,739 --> 00:09:52,008
​​​ ​on Blue Hawaii flavor!​ ​​

169
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,643
​​​ ​Hmm...​ ​​

170
00:09:53,643 --> 00:09:57,147
​​​ ​Where did that stall go?​ ​​

171
00:09:58,214 --> 00:09:59,249
​​​ ​Hmm?​ ​​

172
00:09:59,249 --> 00:10:03,687
​​​ ​I daresay I sense shaved​ ​​
​​ ​ice in that direction.​ ​​

173
00:10:04,621 --> 00:10:07,624
​​​ ​This time,​ ​​
​​ ​I've got it for sure!​ ​​

174
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:11,394
​​​ ​I daresay, it must​ ​​
​​ ​be over there!​ ​​

175
00:10:11,895 --> 00:10:13,096
​​​ ​Come, come!​ ​​

176
00:10:13,096 --> 00:10:16,967
​​​ ​Have some faith​ ​​
​​ ​in me and follow!​ ​​

177
00:10:22,405 --> 00:10:25,075
​​​ ​I had​ ​​
​​ ​so much fun today!​ ​​

178
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,645
​​​ ​The fireworks​ ​​
​​ ​were so beautiful.​ ​​

179
00:10:28,645 --> 00:10:31,114
​​​ ​I could gaze​ ​​
​​ ​at them forever.​ ​​

180
00:10:34,084 --> 00:10:36,486
​​​ ​Did you also have fun​ ​​

181
00:10:36,486 --> 00:10:38,555
​​​ ​at this summer​ ​​
​​ ​festival with me?​ ​​

182
00:10:39,456 --> 00:10:40,256
​​​ ​What?!​ ​​

183
00:10:40,256 --> 00:10:44,628
​​​ ​G-Gosh, you're gonna​ ​​
​​ ​make me blush with​ ​​
​​ ​those compliments!​ ​​

184
00:10:47,998 --> 00:10:49,432
​​​ ​...​ ​​

185
00:10:51,101 --> 00:10:52,869
​​​ ​...​ ​​

186
00:10:53,336 --> 00:10:57,207
​​​ ​For next year's festival​ ​​

187
00:10:57,207 --> 00:10:59,342
​​​ ​and the year​ ​​
​​ ​after that, too...​ ​​

188
00:10:59,776 --> 00:11:02,045
​​​ ​I wanna go to​ ​​
​​ ​them with you.​ ​​

189
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:09,386
​​​ ​I love you.​ ​​
​​ ​I love you so much.​ ​​

190
00:11:12,689 --> 00:11:13,957
​​​ ​Hee-hee.​ ​​

191
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:23,233
​​​ ​Going to the festival​ ​​
​​ ​today was so much fun!​ ​​

192
00:11:23,233 --> 00:11:26,936
​​​ ​I wanted to win the​ ​​
​​ ​video game from​ ​​
​​ ​the prize drawing,​ ​​

193
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,539
​​​ ​but I'm pretty happy​ ​​
​​ ​with this adorable plush!​ ​​

194
00:11:29,539 --> 00:11:30,907
​​​ ​Hm-hmm 🎵​ ​​

195
00:11:30,907 --> 00:11:32,108
​​​ ​Oh, yeah!​ ​​

196
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:35,612
​​​ ​Remember how​ ​​
​​ ​I wanted to eat at​ ​​
​​ ​every single stall?​ ​​

197
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:39,482
​​​ ​I thought I was​ ​​
​​ ​up to the challenge,​ ​​
​​ ​but I guess not!​ ​​

198
00:11:39,482 --> 00:11:41,685
​​​ ​There was karaage,​ ​​
​​ ​yakisoba, takoyaki...​ ​​

199
00:11:41,685 --> 00:11:43,386
​​​ ​And I wasn't prepared​ ​​

200
00:11:43,386 --> 00:11:47,290
​​​ ​for there to be so many​ ​​
​​ ​baby castella in the bag!​ ​​

201
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,560
​​​ ​Maybe next year...​ ​​

202
00:11:53,363 --> 00:11:58,268
​​​ ​"Let's go to the festival​ ​​
​​ ​together next year, too!"​ ​​

203
00:11:58,968 --> 00:11:59,936
​​​ ​Okay?​ ​​

204
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,043
​​​ ​Heh-heh!​ ​​

205
00:12:07,043 --> 00:12:09,546
​​​ ​This is the XO​ ​​
​​ ​and professor's​ ​​
​​ ​latest invention.​ ​​

206
00:12:09,546 --> 00:12:12,682
​​​ ​An summer festival​ ​​
​​ ​simulation button!​ ​​

207
00:12:12,682 --> 00:12:15,318
​​​ ​People don't wanna​ ​​
​​ ​go out in this heat?​ ​​

208
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:19,389
​​​ ​This secret weapon​ ​​
​​ ​will make them​ ​​
​​ ​fall into indulgence!​ ​​

209
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:21,391
​​​ ​Let's try it out!​ ​​

210
00:12:21,391 --> 00:12:22,926
​​​ ​Click!​ ​​

211
00:12:24,894 --> 00:12:27,831
​​​ ​Whoa! It's so immersive!​ ​​

212
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:30,800
​​​ ​All right,​ ​​
​​ ​let's have some fun!​ ​​

213
00:12:31,568 --> 00:12:33,570
​​​ ​Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha!​ ​​

214
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:44,848
​​​ ​Oh! That was close.​ ​​

215
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:47,817
​​​ ​We ended up​ ​​
​​ ​indulging the most of all!​ ​​

216
00:12:51,821 --> 00:12:55,425
​​​ ​But you also wanted to​ ​​
​​ ​experience more, right?​ ​​

217
00:12:56,493 --> 00:12:58,027
​​​ ​Click!​ ​​

218
00:13:03,133 --> 00:13:05,135
​​​ ​Mmm!​ ​​

219
00:13:06,436 --> 00:13:10,173
​​​ ​Gotta love the sights​ ​​
​​ ​and sounds of a festival!​ ​​

220
00:13:10,173 --> 00:13:11,741
​​​ ​Like, look over there!​ ​​

221
00:13:11,741 --> 00:13:14,778
​​​ ​The lanterns​ ​​
​​ ​are so pretty!​ ​​

222
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:17,147
​​​ ​When it's summer​ ​​
​​ ​in Japan,​ ​​

223
00:13:17,147 --> 00:13:19,716
​​​ ​you just gotta go​ ​​
​​ ​to a festival!​ ​​

224
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,785
​​​ ​There's so much to do!​ ​​

225
00:13:21,785 --> 00:13:23,219
​​​ ​Baked potatoes,​ ​​

226
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,420
​​​ ​karaage,​ ​​

227
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,122
​​​ ​shaved ice...​ ​​

228
00:13:26,122 --> 00:13:29,259
​​​ ​Whoops!​ ​​
​​ ​I'm just listing food!​ ​​

229
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,395
​​​ ​That's right!​ ​​
​​ ​The fireworks!​ ​​

230
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:35,598
​​​ ​You can't have a festival​ ​​
​​ ​without fireworks!​ ​​

231
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:39,102
​​​ ​The show's gonna​ ​​
​​ ​start pretty soon.​ ​​

232
00:13:39,102 --> 00:13:41,070
​​​ ​I can't wait!​ ​​

233
00:13:42,939 --> 00:13:45,041
​​​ ​I hope we can see​ ​​

234
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:48,812
​​​ ​lots more pretty​ ​​
​​ ​sights together.​ ​​

235
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,948
​​​ ​It's a promise!​ ​​

236
00:14:01,357 --> 00:14:01,991
​​​ ​Gah!​ ​​

237
00:14:01,991 --> 00:14:04,060
​​​ ​I missed again!​ ​​

238
00:14:04,627 --> 00:14:06,095
​​​ ​But I'll get it next time!​ ​​

239
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,530
​​​ ​Just you watch!​ ​​

240
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:10,300
​​​ ​Huh?​ ​​

241
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,201
​​​ ​What?!​ ​​

242
00:14:11,201 --> 00:14:13,636
​​​ ​Wait, how is​ ​​
​​ ​that allowed?!​ ​​

243
00:14:15,872 --> 00:14:18,007
​​​ ​This is totally rigged!​ ​​

244
00:14:18,007 --> 00:14:19,242
​​​ ​Darn stupid...​ ​​

245
00:14:19,242 --> 00:14:20,910
​​​ ​That does it!​ ​​

246
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:23,680
​​​ ​Yes! The prize is mine!​ ​​

247
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,182
​​​ ​That's what​ ​​
​​ ​I'm talking about!​ ​​

248
00:14:26,182 --> 00:14:27,817
​​​ ​Ah-ha-ha-ha!​ ​​

249
00:14:27,817 --> 00:14:30,553
​​​ ​Ah-ha-ha-ha!​ ​​

250
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,261
​​​ ​There's a lot going on​ ​​
​​ ​at this festival.​ ​​

251
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:42,065
​​​ ​It's about​ ​​
​​ ​time for dinner.​ ​​

252
00:14:42,599 --> 00:14:44,968
​​​ ​We're going to a​ ​​
​​ ​sushi place, right?​ ​​

253
00:14:46,202 --> 00:14:48,037
​​​ ​That restaurant is​ ​​
​​ ​supposed to have​ ​​

254
00:14:48,037 --> 00:14:51,107
​​​ ​a great view of the​ ​​
​​ ​fireworks, right?​ ​​

255
00:14:53,109 --> 00:14:55,345
​​​ ​Hey, what are you​ ​​
​​ ​apologizing for?​ ​​

256
00:14:56,446 --> 00:15:00,450
​​​ ​You're right, more​ ​​
​​ ​people came to the​ ​​
​​ ​festival than I expected.​ ​​

257
00:15:01,551 --> 00:15:04,053
​​​ ​I see.​ ​​

258
00:15:04,053 --> 00:15:05,655
​​​ ​With this crowd,​ ​​

259
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:09,926
​​​ ​we'd probably need​ ​​
​​ ​a reservation to get​ ​​
​​ ​into that restaurant.​ ​​

260
00:15:09,926 --> 00:15:11,594
​​​ ​But, don't worry!​ ​​

261
00:15:11,594 --> 00:15:14,464
​​​ ​I had a feeling​ ​​
​​ ​this might happen,​ ​​

262
00:15:14,464 --> 00:15:18,034
​​​ ​so I went ahead and​ ​​
​​ ​made a reservation​ ​​
​​ ​at that place.​ ​​

263
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,976
​​​ ​Oh, look! You can catch​ ​​
​​ ​goldfish over there.​ ​​

264
00:15:26,976 --> 00:15:28,778
​​​ ​Wanna give it a try?​ ​​

265
00:15:29,946 --> 00:15:30,847
​​​ ​Hehe.​ ​​

266
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:33,182
​​​ ​I swing my scythe at​ ​​
​​ ​humans all the time,​ ​​

267
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:36,152
​​​ ​so catching a little​ ​​
​​ ​fish is gonna​ ​​
​​ ​be a piece of cake!​ ​​

268
00:15:36,152 --> 00:15:37,787
​​​ ​Watch this!​ ​​

269
00:15:38,988 --> 00:15:41,424
​​​ ​Hmm... There!​ ​​

270
00:15:42,425 --> 00:15:45,028
​​​ ​Ah, I broke it.​ ​​

271
00:15:46,095 --> 00:15:48,364
​​​ ​That was just a​ ​​
​​ ​practice round, OK?​ ​​

272
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:52,001
​​​ ​I've got the hang of it​ ​​
​​ ​now, so I'll catch one​ ​​
​​ ​this time for sure!​ ​​

273
00:15:53,102 --> 00:15:54,037
​​​ ​Come on!​ ​​

274
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:55,972
​​​ ​That was the​ ​​
​​ ​perfect timing just now!​ ​​

275
00:15:55,972 --> 00:15:58,074
​​​ ​Why is this so hard?​ ​​

276
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:11,254
​​​ ​I'm back!​ ​​

277
00:16:11,254 --> 00:16:13,823
​​​ ​And I got shaved ice!​ ​​

278
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:16,125
​​​ ​It was hard to​ ​​
​​ ​decide on a flavor,​ ​​

279
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,995
​​​ ​but I picked​ ​​
​​ ​an old favorite!​ ​​

280
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:23,132
​​​ ​Mm! So cold​ ​​
​​ ​and delicious!​ ​​

281
00:16:23,533 --> 00:16:25,001
​​​ ​Want some?​ ​​

282
00:16:25,001 --> 00:16:28,805
​​​ ​Oh, but both​ ​​
​​ ​your hands are full.​ ​​

283
00:16:29,172 --> 00:16:32,175
​​​ ​Well, as thanks for​ ​​
​​ ​carrying our stuff,​ ​​

284
00:16:32,175 --> 00:16:34,877
​​​ ​allow me to feed you.​ ​​

285
00:16:34,877 --> 00:16:37,814
​​​ ​Open wide!​ ​​

286
00:16:38,214 --> 00:16:42,251
​​​ ​C'mon, don't be shy!​ ​​

287
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:46,589
​​​ ​Or what, you don't​ ​​
​​ ​want it from me?​ ​​

288
00:16:49,859 --> 00:16:51,327
​​​ ​Ha-ha-ha!​ ​​

289
00:16:51,327 --> 00:16:54,030
​​​ ​Brain freeze?​ ​​

290
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:57,233
​​​ ​All right.​ ​​
​​ ​Smaller bites, then.​ ​​

291
00:16:57,233 --> 00:17:00,269
​​​ ​Let's enjoy it together,​ ​​
​​ ​a little at a time.​ ​​

292
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:10,780
​​​ ​Whatcha doing​ ​​
​​ ​over here?​ ​​

293
00:17:11,714 --> 00:17:13,649
​​​ ​Are you tired?​ ​​

294
00:17:13,649 --> 00:17:15,852
​​​ ​Yeah, it's really​ ​​
​​ ​crowded here.​ ​​

295
00:17:16,152 --> 00:17:19,422
​​​ ​I think I'll rest​ ​​
​​ ​for a bit, too.​ ​​

296
00:17:20,256 --> 00:17:23,626
​​​ ​So, what do you​ ​​
​​ ​wanna do next?​ ​​

297
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,695
​​​ ​Wanna watch​ ​​
​​ ​the fireworks?​ ​​

298
00:17:27,597 --> 00:17:30,600
​​​ ​This is just a​ ​​
​​ ​suggestion, but...​ ​​

299
00:17:32,568 --> 00:17:35,338
​​​ ​wanna sneak out of​ ​​
​​ ​here, just the two of us?​ ​​

300
00:17:36,606 --> 00:17:38,775
​​​ ​No one else​ ​​
​​ ​has to know.​ ​​

301
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,778
​​​ ​Hee-hee! ♪​ ​​

302
00:17:48,384 --> 00:17:50,620
​​​ ​Hey, have you heard?​ ​​

303
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,489
​​​ ​The school in the​ ​​
​​ ​neighboring town​ ​​

304
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,625
​​​ ​is cursed!​ ​​

305
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:56,993
​​​ ​Heh-heh-heh...​ ​​

306
00:17:58,428 --> 00:17:59,662
​​​ ​"So anyway,​ ​​

307
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:02,298
​​​ ​I decided to come,​ ​​
​​ ​'cause I'm invincible!"​ ​​

308
00:18:02,298 --> 00:18:03,366
​​​ ​"Hah!"​ ​​

309
00:18:04,033 --> 00:18:06,069
​​​ ​"AAAAAAAH!"​ ​​

310
00:18:06,069 --> 00:18:07,136
​​​ ​Oh, sorry,​ ​​
​​ ​just to be clear,​ ​​

311
00:18:07,136 --> 00:18:09,372
​​​ ​I'm not a ghost. I just​ ​​
​​ ​came here by myself​ ​​
​​ ​because I heard​ ​​

312
00:18:09,372 --> 00:18:11,274
​​​ ​it's a good paranormal​ ​​

00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:34,476
​​​ ​Hey!​ ​​

626
00:36:34,476 --> 00:36:38,013
​​​ ​I'm right here, so​ ​​
​​ ​where are you looking?​ ​​

627
00:36:38,013 --> 00:36:39,948
​​​ ​We came to the​ ​​
​​ ​beach together,​ ​​

628
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:41,917
​​​ ​and all you wanna​ ​​
​​ ​look at is other girls?​ ​​

629
00:36:41,917 --> 00:36:43,318
​​​ ​I'm kinda hurt.​ ​​

630
00:36:44,152 --> 00:36:47,489
​​​ ​What, looking at me​ ​​
​​ ​too much makes​ ​​
​​ ​you nervous?​ ​​

631
00:36:47,489 --> 00:36:49,291
​​​ ​Really?​ ​​

632
00:36:51,059 --> 00:36:54,863
​​​ ​Even so, it's not right to​ ​​
​​ ​avert your gaze like that.​ ​​

633
00:36:56,665 --> 00:36:59,734
​​​ ​Well? Did your​ ​​
​​ ​heart skip a beat?​ ​​

634
00:37:00,735 --> 00:37:04,139
​​​ ​Hey, what's with​ ​​
​​ ​the stupid grin?​ ​​

635
00:37:05,106 --> 00:37:07,442
​​​ ​I'm starting to​ ​​
​​ ​get hungry.​ ​​

636
00:37:07,442 --> 00:37:09,344
​​​ ​Let's go grab a bite.​ ​​

637
00:37:10,111 --> 00:37:14,382
​​​ ​I can't wait to eat at the​ ​​
​​ ​beachfront restaurants!​ ​​

638
00:37:14,849 --> 00:37:18,553
​​​ ​If you've got any​ ​​
​​ ​recommendations,​ ​​
​​ ​I'd love to hear them!​ ​​

639
00:37:24,693 --> 00:37:25,627
​​​ ​Hup!​ ​​

640
00:37:25,627 --> 00:37:27,062
​​​ ​Hoh!​ ​​

641
00:37:27,062 --> 00:37:28,797
​​​ ​Oh, there you are!​ ​​

642
00:37:28,797 --> 00:37:30,398
​​​ ​I've been waiting!​ ​​

643
00:37:30,398 --> 00:37:32,667
​​​ ​The next match​ ​​
​​ ​is about to start!​ ​​

644
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,436
​​​ ​C'mon, join in!​ ​​

645
00:37:34,436 --> 00:37:36,738
​​​ ​Huh? What's that?​ ​​

646
00:37:36,738 --> 00:37:39,808
​​​ ​You don't wanna, 'cause​ ​​
​​ ​you're out of shape?​ ​​

647
00:37:39,808 --> 00:37:41,610
​​​ ​You can't be serious!​ ​​

648
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:43,979
​​​ ​Summer only​ ​​
​​ ​comes once a year!​ ​​

649
00:37:44,446 --> 00:37:46,915
​​​ ​Fine, let's do some​ ​​
​​ ​warm-ups instead!​ ​​

650
00:37:46,915 --> 00:37:50,185
​​​ ​Hey, are you listening?​ ​​

651
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:53,255
​​​ ​What are you staring at?​ ​​

652
00:37:53,255 --> 00:37:56,124
​​​ ​You wanna sit back,​ ​​
​​ ​relax, and watch me?​ ​​

653
00:37:56,124 --> 00:37:56,925
​​​ ​Cut it out!​ ​​

654
00:37:56,925 --> 00:37:58,693
​​​ ​If that's the case,​ ​​

655
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:01,162
​​​ ​you'd get a better​ ​​
​​ ​view if you play!​ ​​

656
00:38:01,162 --> 00:38:03,098
​​​ ​It's such a beautiful day.​ ​​

657
00:38:03,098 --> 00:38:06,268
​​​ ​Don't waste it​ ​​
​​ ​sitting around!​ ​​

658
00:38:06,801 --> 00:38:10,138
​​​ ​Okay, I'll start!​ ​​

659
00:38:10,138 --> 00:38:12,040
​​​ ​Here goes!​ ​​

660
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,750
​​​ ​Hee-hee, this is so fun!​ ​​

661
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:25,954
​​​ ​Take that! Yah-yah!​ ​​

662
00:38:25,954 --> 00:38:29,057
​​​ ​Gaa! So sawty!​ ​​

663
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:31,660
​​​ ​Ptoo!​ ​​

664
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:32,827
​​​ ​Augh...​ ​​

665
00:38:32,827 --> 00:38:34,696
​​​ ​Sawty food is good,​ ​​

666
00:38:34,696 --> 00:38:38,533
​​​ ​but why does the sea​ ​​
​​ ​have to be so sawty?​ ​​

667
00:38:38,533 --> 00:38:41,503
​​​ ​If seawater was​ ​​
​​ ​cwear and tasty,​ ​​

668
00:38:41,503 --> 00:38:45,073
​​​ ​wouldn't that​ ​​
​​ ​be wonderfuw?​ ​​

669
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:48,310
​​​ ​Cause we could use​ ​​
​​ ​the sawt fwom the sea​ ​​

670
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:51,680
​​​ ​to make wots​ ​​
​​ ​of tasty snacks!​ ​​

671
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,581
​​​ ​If I said​ ​​

672
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:56,785
​​​ ​to make snacks​ ​​
​​ ​out of seawater,​ ​​

673
00:38:56,785 --> 00:38:58,019
​​​ ​I'm sure my Lu-knights​ ​​

674
00:38:58,019 --> 00:39:00,455
​​​ ​would wush​ ​​
​​ ​into action, right?​ ​​

675
00:39:01,156 --> 00:39:04,125
​​​ ​You'll do it, wight?​ ​​

676
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:07,395
​​​ ​Then off you go!​ ​​

677
00:39:15,704 --> 00:39:18,039
​​​ ​It's finally here.​ ​​

678
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:20,075
​​​ ​The beach episode!​ ​​

679
00:39:21,076 --> 00:39:23,044
​​​ ​Now then!​ ​​
​​ ​Where do we start?​ ​​

680
00:39:23,044 --> 00:39:24,679
​​​ ​What do we do first?​ ​​

681
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:27,482
​​​ ​Hmm...​ ​​
​​ ​Beach volleyball?​ ​​

682
00:39:27,816 --> 00:39:29,417
​​​ ​Watergun?​ ​​

683
00:39:29,417 --> 00:39:32,554
​​​ ​Standing in the water​ ​​
​​ ​and splashing​ ​​
​​ ​each other?​ ​​

684
00:39:32,554 --> 00:39:34,356
​​​ ​Burying someone​ ​​
​​ ​in the sand!​ ​​

685
00:39:36,057 --> 00:39:38,793
​​​ ​Or maybe getting carried​ ​​
​​ ​out to sea in a pool tube?​ ​​

686
00:39:39,427 --> 00:39:41,830
​​​ ​What about that prank​ ​​
​​ ​where you put on​ ​​
​​ ​a fake shark fin​ ​​

687
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:43,965
​​​ ​and scare people​ ​​
​​ ​in the water?​ ​​

688
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:49,137
​​​ ​Or sitting under a​ ​​
​​ ​beach umbrella rubbing​ ​​
​​ ​sunscreen on each other.​ ​​

689
00:39:49,938 --> 00:39:54,242
​​​ ​Ahh. Man,​ ​​
​​ ​beaches are the best!​ ​​

690
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:58,480
​​​ ​There's so little time!​ ​​
​​ ​Let's get started.​ ​​

691
00:39:59,214 --> 00:40:03,418
​​​ ​We gotta experience​ ​​
​​ ​the true anime​ ​​
​​ ​beach episode!​ ​​

692
00:40:10,859 --> 00:40:12,460
​​​ ​I'm back!​ ​​

693
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,695
​​​ ​Ta-da!​ ​​

694
00:40:13,695 --> 00:40:16,064
​​​ ​Well? Check it out!​ ​​

695
00:40:16,064 --> 00:40:17,832
​​​ ​My swimsuit!​ ​​

696
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,667
​​​ ​Isn't it cute?​ ​​

697
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:20,802
​​​ ​Hee-hee! ♪​ ​​

698
00:40:20,802 --> 00:40:22,237
​​​ ​Right?​ ​​

699
00:40:22,937 --> 00:40:24,672
​​​ ​H-Hey!​ ​​

700
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,541
​​​ ​Don't stare!​ ​​

701
00:40:26,541 --> 00:40:28,777
​​​ ​Sure, I told you​ ​​
​​ ​to check it out,​ ​​

702
00:40:28,777 --> 00:40:30,979
​​​ ​but when you look me​ ​​
​​ ​over so intently,​ ​​

703
00:40:30,979 --> 00:40:32,714
​​​ ​it's embarrassing!​ ​​

704
00:40:32,714 --> 00:40:34,616
​​​ ​A-Anyway, let's​ ​​
​​ ​stop wasting time!​ ​​

705
00:40:34,616 --> 00:40:36,918
​​​ ​There's so much​ ​​
​​ ​to do at the beach!​ ​​

706
00:40:36,918 --> 00:40:38,953
​​​ ​So? What should​ ​​
​​ ​we do first?​ ​​

707
00:40:38,953 --> 00:40:40,088
​​​ ​Play with​ ​​
​​ ​this beach ball?​ ​​

708
00:40:40,088 --> 00:40:41,489
​​​ ​Swim in the ocean?​ ​​

709
00:40:41,489 --> 00:40:43,525
​​​ ​Let's have lots of fun!​ ​​

710
00:40:44,225 --> 00:40:45,293
​​​ ​Ack!​ ​​

711
00:40:46,461 --> 00:40:48,730
​​​ ​S-Sorry...​ ​​

712
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:56,171
​​​ ​Take that!​ ​​

713
00:40:56,504 --> 00:40:57,806
​​​ ​Ha-ha!​ ​​

714
00:40:57,806 --> 00:40:59,674
​​​ ​Gotcha!​ ​​

715
00:40:59,674 --> 00:41:02,043
​​​ ​My plan to​ ​​
​​ ​use my cuteness​ ​​
​​ ​as a distraction​ ​​

716
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:05,747
​​​ ​so I could soak​ ​​
​​ ​my assistant​ ​​
​​ ​went off flawlessly!​ ​​

717
00:41:05,747 --> 00:41:09,984
​​​ ​I've once again​ ​​
​​ ​demonstrated my​ ​​
​​ ​exceptional brains!​ ​​

718
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:11,352
​​​ ​Eek!​ ​​

719
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:13,455
​​​ ​Argh!​ ​​

720
00:41:13,455 --> 00:41:16,057
​​​ ​Now you've done it!​ ​​

721
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:18,393
​​​ ​Now it's my turn!​ ​​

722
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:20,061
​​​ ​Take that! And that!​ ​​

723
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:22,063
​​​ ​And that and that!​ ​​

724
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:23,231
​​​ ​Ha-ha-ha!​ ​​

725
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:27,135
​​​ ​Stop it, assistant!​ ​​
​​ ​That's cold!​ ​​

726
00:41:27,469 --> 00:41:30,905
​​​ ​But this is so much fun!​ ​​

727
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:33,975
​​​ ​Ah... Ah... Ah-choo!​ ​​

728
00:41:34,509 --> 00:41:39,647
​​​ ​Oh, I'm might be​ ​​
​​ ​feeling a bit chilly...​ ​​

729
00:41:39,647 --> 00:41:40,949
​​​ ​In that case,​ ​​

730
00:41:40,949 --> 00:41:44,285
​​​ ​the best way to​ ​​
​​ ​warm up is this!​ ​​

731
00:41:44,786 --> 00:41:47,222
​​​ ​Gosh,​ ​​
​​ ​I'm such a genius!​ ​​

732
00:41:47,222 --> 00:41:49,257
​​​ ​Augh!​ ​​

733
00:41:53,795 --> 00:41:56,364
​​​ ​Hey! Behind you.​ ​​

734
00:41:56,865 --> 00:41:59,634
​​​ ​Hehe. Check this out.​ ​​

735
00:42:02,737 --> 00:42:05,707
​​​ ​Hee-hee.​ ​​
​​ ​How do I look?​ ​​

736
00:42:06,407 --> 00:42:08,877
​​​ ​You think​ ​​
​​ ​I'm cute? Hee-hee.​ ​​

737
00:42:08,877 --> 00:42:11,346
​​​ ​I know, right?​ ​​

738
00:42:12,847 --> 00:42:15,750
​​​ ​Thank you, thank you.​ ​​

739
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:17,418
​​​ ​Hee-hee.​ ​​

740
00:42:17,418 --> 00:42:18,586
​​​ ​Ugh!​ ​​

741
00:42:19,387 --> 00:42:20,822
​​​ ​Ouch.​ ​​

742
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:23,591
​​​ ​Oh.​ ​​

743
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:29,097
​​​ ​Everything's all​ ​​
​​ ​spinny now. Whoa.​ ​​

744
00:42:29,097 --> 00:42:32,934
​​​ ​Oi! What are you​ ​​
​​ ​laughing at, huh?​ ​​

745
00:42:37,739 --> 00:42:41,042
​​​ ​So this is the allegedly​ ​​
​​ ​haunted place?​ ​​

746
00:42:41,743 --> 00:42:43,111
​​​ ​No, I'm not scared.​ ​​

747
00:42:43,611 --> 00:42:45,046
​​​ ​What, you don't​ ​​
​​ ​believe me?​ ​​

748
00:42:45,446 --> 00:42:47,916
​​​ ​Look, if this​ ​​
​​ ​place is haunted,​ ​​

749
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:49,884
​​​ ​that means it's​ ​​
​​ ​full of ghosts, right?​ ​​

750
00:42:50,351 --> 00:42:51,419
​​​ ​In other words,​ ​​

751
00:42:51,753 --> 00:42:55,490
​​​ ​the stories of all​ ​​
​​ ​those dearly departed​ ​​
​​ ​are gathered here.​ ​​

752
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:56,624
​​​ ​If I'm lucky,​ ​​

753
00:42:56,624 --> 00:42:59,160
​​​ ​I'll meet some​ ​​
​​ ​of them, so I can​ ​​
​​ ​archive their stories!​ ​​

754
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:00,161
​​​ ​Hey,​ ​​

755
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:02,330
​​​ ​maybe I should​ ​​
​​ ​try to summon​ ​​
​​ ​the spirits myself?​ ​​

756
00:43:02,463 --> 00:43:05,500
​​​ ​I'd love to see the look​ ​​
​​ ​of terror on your face...​ ​​

757
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:08,269
​​​ ​Oh, don't be​ ​​
​​ ​such a scaredy-cat.​ ​​

758
00:43:08,469 --> 00:43:10,872
​​​ ​Ghost stories are mostly​ ​​
​​ ​superstition, anyway.​ ​​

759
00:43:11,239 --> 00:43:12,774
​​​ ​Here,​ ​​
​​ ​I'll prove it to you.​ ​​

760
00:43:13,441 --> 00:43:14,976
​​​ ​Say cheese!​ ​​

761
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:19,514
​​​ ​See, as long as we're​ ​​
​​ ​giving off happy,​ ​​
​​ ​positive vibes,​ ​​

762
00:43:19,581 --> 00:43:21,583
​​​ ​it'll scare away the​ ​​
​​ ​negative ghost energy!​ ​​

763
00:43:23,051 --> 00:43:23,985
​​​ ​...What's the matter?​ ​​

764
00:43:25,153 --> 00:43:27,121
​​​ ​What?! Is that a face?!​ ​​

765
00:43:27,922 --> 00:43:30,058
​​​ ​Oh gosh!​ ​​
​​ ​Let's get outta here!​ ​​

766
00:43:35,496 --> 00:43:38,433
​​​ ​Yeah, just a little​ ​​
​​ ​to the right.​ ​​

767
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:41,869
​​​ ​No, you went too far!​ ​​

768
00:43:42,136 --> 00:43:44,806
​​​ ​If you don't smash that​ ​​
​​ ​watermelon open soon,​ ​​

769
00:43:44,806 --> 00:43:46,708
​​​ ​I'm gonna beepin' die!​ ​​

770
00:43:48,142 --> 00:43:51,245
​​​ ​It's so hot out here,​ ​​

771
00:43:51,245 --> 00:43:53,181
​​​ ​if I don't get something​ ​​
​​ ​cool to eat...​ ​​

772
00:43:53,181 --> 00:43:56,618
​​​ ​then all the emotions​ ​​
​​ ​inside me are​ ​​
​​ ​gonna burst out!​ ​​

773
00:43:58,219 --> 00:44:00,722
​​​ ​Okay, keep​ ​​
​​ ​going straight...​ ​​

774
00:44:01,589 --> 00:44:03,224
​​​ ​Now stop right there!​ ​​

775
00:44:03,758 --> 00:44:05,727
​​​ ​And swing!​ ​​

776
00:44:06,294 --> 00:44:09,631
​​​ ​Yeah! Nice!​ ​​

777
00:44:09,697 --> 00:44:12,233
​​​ ​You smashed that​ ​​
​​ ​watermelon open​ ​​
​​ ​real good!​ ​​

778
00:44:13,835 --> 00:44:15,970
​​​ ​Here, lemme get​ ​​
​​ ​a piece for you.​ ​​

779
00:44:17,305 --> 00:44:18,640
​​​ ​Let's eat together!​ ​​

780
00:44:19,474 --> 00:44:23,044
​​​ ​Mmm, it's so good!​ ​​

781
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:27,849
​​​ ​Thanks to you,​ ​​
​​ ​my radiance is​ ​​
​​ ​even brighter!​ ​​

782
00:44:32,987 --> 00:44:34,656
​​​ ​The sun is so bright...​ ​​

783
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:37,925
​​​ ​I guess that blinding​ ​​
​​ ​light is how you know​ ​​
​​ ​you're at the beach.​ ​​

784
00:44:39,027 --> 00:44:39,761
​​​ ​What?​ ​​

785
00:44:40,161 --> 00:44:43,464
​​​ ​No, I'm fine just hanging​ ​​
​​ ​out under the umbrella.​ ​​

786
00:44:43,698 --> 00:44:46,934
​​​ ​I'd rather not​ ​​
​​ ​expose myself to​ ​​
​​ ​that harsh sunlight.​ ​​

787
00:44:47,301 --> 00:44:49,470
​​​ ​We'd be missing out​ ​​
​​ ​if we don't swim?​ ​​

788
00:44:49,837 --> 00:44:51,906
​​​ ​Well, you can go ahead.​ ​​

789
00:44:51,906 --> 00:44:52,807
​​​ ​Don't mind me.​ ​​

790
00:44:53,074 --> 00:44:55,043
​​​ ​If you're having fun,​ ​​
​​ ​then so am I.​ ​​

791
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:56,644
​​​ ​Hmph.​ ​​

792
00:44:56,644 --> 00:44:58,913
​​​ ​You said that on​ ​​
​​ ​purpose, didn't you?​ ​​

793
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:01,616
​​​ ​You know how​ ​​
​​ ​easily I sunburn.​ ​​

794
00:45:01,783 --> 00:45:05,486
​​​ ​If I go out there,​ ​​
​​ ​I'm gonna turn into​ ​​
​​ ​an itchy red blob!​ ​​

795
00:45:05,753 --> 00:45:06,521
​​​ ​And besides...​ ​​

796
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:08,222
​​​ ​being seen in​ ​​
​​ ​my swimsuit...​ ​​

797
00:45:08,322 --> 00:45:10,825
​​​ ​is kinda embarrassing...​ ​​

798
00:45:12,527 --> 00:45:14,162
​​​ ​Fine, you win.​ ​​

799
00:45:14,529 --> 00:45:18,533
​​​ ​But only if you help me​ ​​
​​ ​put on sunscreen, okay?​ ​​

800
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:19,767
​​​ ​Heh-heh,​ ​​

801
00:45:19,767 --> 00:45:22,804
​​​ ​c'mon, what are​ ​​
​​ ​you blushing for?​ ​​

802
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:26,941
​​​ ​You shouldn't tease​ ​​
​​ ​if you can't take it!​ ​​

803
00:45:32,013 --> 00:45:34,182
​​​ ​Look!​ ​​
​​ ​There's cotton candy!​ ​​

804
00:45:34,949 --> 00:45:36,250
​​​ ​This one's​ ​​
​​ ​blue and fluffy...​ ​​

805
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:39,020
​​​ ​Isn't that basically me?​ ​​

806
00:45:39,387 --> 00:45:42,490
​​​ ​Mm-hm-hm~ I bet you​ ​​
​​ ​want some too, huh?​ ​​

807
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:44,392
​​​ ​Here, you can​ ​​
​​ ​have a bite.​ ​​

808
00:45:45,526 --> 00:45:46,594
​​​ ​Is it good?​ ​​

809
00:45:46,728 --> 00:45:51,165
​​​ ​If the cotton candy​ ​​
​​ ​is anything like​ ​​
​​ ​me, it must be...​ ​​

810
00:45:51,466 --> 00:45:54,469
​​​ ​Huh? Why are​ ​​
​​ ​you making such​ ​​
​​ ​a funny face?​ ​​

811
00:45:55,136 --> 00:45:56,871
​​​ ​You're being silly...​ ​​

812
00:45:57,271 --> 00:46:00,975
​​​ ​Oh, I know! You're​ ​​
​​ ​just trying to trick me!​ ​​

813
00:46:01,209 --> 00:46:03,211
​​​ ​But I'm not​ ​​
​​ ​gonna fall for that!​ ​​

814
00:46:03,211 --> 00:46:06,547
​​​ ​I know cotton candy​ ​​
​​ ​tastes really​ ​​
​​ ​sweet and yummy!​ ​​

815
00:46:07,281 --> 00:46:08,950
​​​ ​Aahm...​ ​​

816
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:13,020
​​​ ​Waoh! The inside of my​ ​​
​​ ​mouth feels all tingly!​ ​​

817
00:46:13,154 --> 00:46:16,524
​​​ ​And there's this minty​ ​​
​​ ​breeze in my sniffer, too!​ ​​

818
00:46:16,524 --> 00:46:20,762
​​​ ​Eh-heh-heh, it's not what​ ​​
​​ ​I expected, but I like it!​ ​​

819
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:23,531
​​​ ​And I'm gonna​ ​​
​​ ​make you like it too!​ ​​

820
00:46:23,531 --> 00:46:25,967
​​​ ​Ey-ey-ey!​ ​​

821
00:46:31,172 --> 00:46:32,440
​​​ ​It's summer!​ ​​

822
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:33,975
​​​ ​It's really hot!​ ​​

823
00:46:34,308 --> 00:46:36,410
​​​ ​And I can't wait to​ ​​
​​ ​get my paws wet!​ ​​

824
00:46:36,778 --> 00:46:40,148
​​​ ​So here we are!​ ​​
​​ ​The river! Ja-jan!​ ​​

825
00:46:40,748 --> 00:46:42,350
​​​ ​All right! Time to play!​ ​​

826
00:46:43,184 --> 00:46:44,519
​​​ ​Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha!​ ​​

827
00:46:44,752 --> 00:46:47,789
​​​ ​C'mon, you too! The​ ​​
​​ ​water's nice and cool!​ ​​

828
00:46:48,489 --> 00:46:49,757
​​​ ​A change of clothes?​ ​​

829
00:46:50,024 --> 00:46:51,392
​​​ ​Don't worry about that!​ ​​

830
00:46:51,592 --> 00:46:53,561
​​​ ​If you ask me,​ ​​
​​ ​when it's this hot out,​ ​​

831
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:55,463
​​​ ​it's better to cool your​ ​​
​​ ​whole self in the water,​ ​​

832
00:46:55,463 --> 00:46:56,631
​​​ ​clothes and all!​ ​​

833
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:59,267
​​​ ​You too!​ ​​
​​ ​Come on, let's play!​ ​​

834
00:47:00,601 --> 00:47:01,636
​​​ ​Ooh?​ ​​

835
00:47:01,636 --> 00:47:03,104
​​​ ​Are you getting​ ​​
​​ ​all flustered​ ​​

836
00:47:03,104 --> 00:47:05,606
​​​ ​because you think​ ​​
​​ ​my wet clothes will​ ​​
​​ ​turn see-through?​ ​​

837
00:47:06,007 --> 00:47:07,074
​​​ ​Not today!​ ​​

838
00:47:07,408 --> 00:47:10,578
​​​ ​I'm wearing something​ ​​
​​ ​underneath, so no​ ​​
​​ ​see-through for you!​ ​​

839
00:47:12,013 --> 00:47:13,181
​​​ ​Did you get​ ​​
​​ ​your hopes up?​ ​​

840
00:47:13,981 --> 00:47:14,715
​​​ ​Fwah?​ ​​

841
00:47:14,949 --> 00:47:16,551
​​​ ​I smell like a wet dog?!​ ​​

842
00:47:16,984 --> 00:47:19,353
​​​ ​Sniff-sniff...​ ​​

843
00:47:19,854 --> 00:47:21,856
​​​ ​Th-There's no way I do!​ ​​

844
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:23,391
​​​ ​I'm a good puppy!​ ​​

845
00:47:23,558 --> 00:47:25,626
​​​ ​And good puppies​ ​​
​​ ​don't smell bad!​ ​​
