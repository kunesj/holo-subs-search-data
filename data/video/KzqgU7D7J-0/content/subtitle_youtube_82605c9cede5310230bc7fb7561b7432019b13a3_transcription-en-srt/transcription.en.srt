so cuz I woke up and I had had uh
basically one banana and I will admit I

3074
01:35:30,270 --> 01:35:30,280
basically one banana and I will admit I
 

3075
01:35:30,280 --> 01:35:33,109
basically one banana and I will admit I
I was going to kind of cheat for my

3076
01:35:33,109 --> 01:35:33,119
I was going to kind of cheat for my
 

3077
01:35:33,119 --> 01:35:36,510

01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:40,510
breakfast because I would I wanted to
there's like some leftover uh like

3080
01:35:40,510 --> 01:35:40,520
there's like some leftover uh like
 

3081
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:44,629
there's like some leftover uh like
chocolate e

3082
01:35:44,629 --> 01:35:44,639

 

3083
01:35:44,639 --> 01:35:46,790

cereal and I tried it but it was

3084
01:35:46,790 --> 01:35:46,800
cereal and I tried it but it was
 

3085
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:49,470
cereal and I tried it but it was
actually disgusting so I only had like

3086
01:35:49,470 --> 01:35:49,480
actually disgusting so I only had like
 

3087
01:35:49,480 --> 01:35:52,189
actually disgusting so I only had like
five bites or so of the chocolate cereal

3088
01:35:52,189 --> 01:35:52,199
five bites or so of the chocolate cereal
 

3089
01:35:52,199 --> 01:35:54,590
five bites or so of the chocolate cereal
and one banana

3090
01:35:54,590 --> 01:35:54,600
and one banana
 

3091
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:56,790
and one banana
so

3092
01:35:56,790 --> 01:35:56,800
so
 

3093
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:59,390
so
yeah I think it's this way

3094
01:35:59,390 --> 01:35:59,400
yeah I think it's this way
 

3095
01:35:59,400 --> 01:36:03,189
yeah I think it's this way
maybe so I'm probably going to get

3096
01:36:03,189 --> 01:36:03,199
maybe so I'm probably going to get
 

3097
01:36:03,199 --> 01:36:05,310
maybe so I'm probably going to get
hungry don't worry it doesn't count as a

3098
01:36:05,310 --> 01:36:05,320
hungry don't worry it doesn't count as a
 

3099
01:36:05,320 --> 01:36:06,669
hungry don't worry it doesn't count as a
cheat because I didn't really eat much

3100
01:36:06,669 --> 01:36:06,679
cheat because I didn't really eat much
 

3101
01:36:06,679 --> 01:36:08,910
cheat because I didn't really eat much
of

3102
01:36:08,910 --> 01:36:08,920

 

3103
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:13,510

it is it this way guess I could try to

3104
01:36:13,510 --> 01:36:13,520
it is it this way guess I could try to
 

3105
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:16,510
it is it this way guess I could try to
go towards

3106
01:36:16,510 --> 01:36:16,520

 

3107
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:18,910

zero this way then I think it's going

3108
01:36:18,910 --> 01:36:18,920
zero this way then I think it's going
 

3109
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:26,910
zero this way then I think it's going
towards zero

3110
01:36:26,910 --> 01:36:26,920
