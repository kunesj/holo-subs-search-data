​​​ ​That wasn't totally awful​ ​​
​​ ​for someone going first.​ ​​

33
00:00:54,138 --> 00:00:55,806
​​​ ​Though you did go a tiny bit over time.​ ​​

34
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:57,508

00:01:55,632 --> 00:01:58,068
​​​ ​Q. What is this?​ ​​

61
00:01:58,068 --> 00:02:00,637
​​​ ​An apple!​ ​​

62
00:02:00,637 --> 00:02:03,507

​​​ ​We wanna make this a long one!​ ​​

68
00:02:07,778 --> 00:02:10,614
​​​ ​It could end immediately​ ​​
​​ ​after the first challenge.​ ​​

69
00:02:10,614 --> 00:02:12,816
​​​ ​That'd be an absolute disaster.​ ​​

70
00:02:12,816 --> 00:02:14,351
​​​ ​I'll put you through that hell if I have to!​ ​​

71
00:02:14,351 --> 00:02:16,253

86
00:02:33,437 --> 00:02:34,771
​​​ ​Sounds good.​ ​​

87

89
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:36,940
​​​ ​We can just wing it.​ ​​

90
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,276
​​​ ​So that's why the bird picked it.​ ​​

91
00:02:39,276 --> 00:02:41,178
​​​ ​Okay, so you're going with shiritori.​ ​​

92
00:02:41,178 --> 00:02:45,883
