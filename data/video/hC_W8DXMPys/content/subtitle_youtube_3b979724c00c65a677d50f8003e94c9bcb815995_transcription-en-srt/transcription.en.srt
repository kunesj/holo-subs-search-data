on the honeywork stage but then this

1272
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:44,440
on the honeywork stage but then this
 

1273
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,309
on the honeywork stage but then this
time you know normally we were split in

1274
00:37:46,309 --> 00:37:46,319
time you know normally we were split in
 

1275
00:37:46,319 --> 00:37:49,510
time you know normally we were split in
like two days right like half of us one

1276
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:49,520
like two days right like half of us one
 

1277
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,069
like two days right like half of us one
day half of us the other day but now we

1278
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:52,079
day half of us the other day but now we
 

1279
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:54,750
day half of us the other day but now we
split into three plus the honey workor

1280
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:54,760
split into three plus the honey workor
 

1281
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,790
split into three plus the honey workor
so it's kind of like four but honey work

1282
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:56,800
so it's kind of like four but honey work
 

1283
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,670
so it's kind of like four but honey work
isn't really split it's just like uh a

1284
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:00,680
isn't really split it's just like uh a
 

1285
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,829
isn't really split it's just like uh a
certain amount of members so yeah yeah

1286
00:38:03,829 --> 00:38:03,839
certain amount of members so yeah yeah
 

1287
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:06,190
certain amount of members so yeah yeah
but free main stations which I

1288
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:06,200
but free main stations which I
 

1289
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,430
but free main stations which I
mean I don't know if that's the ideal

1290
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:08,440
mean I don't know if that's the ideal
 

1291
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,510
mean I don't know if that's the ideal
solution because if you have more OES

1292
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:11,520
solution because if you have more OES
 

1293
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,349
solution because if you have more OES
now like let's say you're free OES and

1294
00:38:13,349 --> 00:38:13,359
now like let's say you're free OES and
 

1295
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:16,510
now like let's say you're free OES and
they're all split across the days I mean

1296
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:16,520
they're all split across the days I mean
 

1297
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,990
they're all split across the days I mean
it gives you a good reason to go to all

4265
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:03,870
so well how reassuring I mean I don't
know it could be kind of kind of

01:58:03,870 --> 01:58:03,880
know it could be kind of kind of
 

4267
01:58:03,880 --> 01:58:06,430
know it could be kind of kind of
reassuring because if you do it yourself

4268
01:58:06,430 --> 01:58:06,440
reassuring because if you do it yourself
 

4269
