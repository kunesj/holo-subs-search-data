three leaves yeah
 

599
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,230
three leaves yeah
and they're like the first the one one p

600
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:00,240
and they're like the first the one one p
 

601
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,629
and they're like the first the one one p
pokes up to the top the other one

602
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:02,639
pokes up to the top the other one
 

603
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,069
pokes up to the top the other one
is like in the middle and the other one

604
00:14:04,069 --> 00:14:04,079
is like in the middle and the other one
 

605
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,230
is like in the middle and the other one
goes i don't have that one i think we'll

606
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:06,240
goes i don't have that one i think we'll
 

607
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,710
goes i don't have that one i think we'll
have to make something like that is

608
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:08,720
have to make something like that is
 

609
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,910
have to make something like that is
there like

610
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:09,920
there like
 

611
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,829
there like
i don't know this one is

612
00:14:14,829 --> 00:14:14,839

 

613
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,910

uh one is only used to make other things

614
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:17,920
uh one is only used to make other things
 

615
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,069
uh one is only used to make other things
but it does doesn't show

616
00:14:20,069 --> 00:14:20,079
but it does doesn't show
 

617
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,629
but it does doesn't show
like it's a basic basal component i

618
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:22,639
like it's a basic basal component i
 

619
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,910
like it's a basic basal component i
think

620
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:25,920

 

621
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,949

um the ox yeah

622
00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:28,959
um the ox yeah
 

623
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,470
um the ox yeah
um pb was made out of p e and f r but o

624
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:32,480
um pb was made out of p e and f r but o
 

625
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,670
um pb was made out of p e and f r but o
x is

626
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:33,680
x is
 

627
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,069
x is
is like a base component

628
00:14:36,069 --> 00:14:36,079
is like a base component
 

629
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,189
is like a base component
unless we can do it the other way around

630
00:14:39,189 --> 00:14:39,199
unless we can do it the other way around
 

631
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:40,069
unless we can do it the other way around
like

632
00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:40,079
like
 

633
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,150
like
going both directions

634
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:42,160
going both directions
 

635
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,269
going both directions
like like making out of pb making p e

636
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:45,279
like like making out of pb making p e
 

637
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,629
like like making out of pb making p e
and f r oh probably um yeah there's like

638
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:48,639
and f r oh probably um yeah there's like
 

639
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,750
and f r oh probably um yeah there's like
an extractor yeah there's an extractor

640
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:51,760
an extractor yeah there's an extractor
 

641
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,110
an extractor yeah there's an extractor
oh

642
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:53,120
oh
 

643
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,350
oh
oh you could split it into two in that

644
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:55,360
oh you could split it into two in that
 

645
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,710
oh you could split it into two in that
case

646
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:56,720
case
 

647
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,629
case
if you have because we are trying to

648
00:14:58,629 --> 00:14:58,639
if you have because we are trying to
 

649
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,069
if you have because we are trying to
make

650
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:00,079
make
 

651
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,829
make
am right now i guess i don't know if you

652
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:01,839
am right now i guess i don't know if you
 

653
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,030
am right now i guess i don't know if you
even have am or po that we would be able

654
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:05,040
even have am or po that we would be able
 

655
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,509
even have am or po that we would be able
to extract ox

656
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:07,519
to extract ox
 

657
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,750
to extract ox
i don't know what those are well we need

658
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:09,760
i don't know what those are well we need
 

659
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,750
i don't know what those are well we need
this we need ox but no we need we need

660
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:13,760
this we need ox but no we need we need
 

661
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,870
this we need ox but no we need we need
pb and ox in order to make am

662
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:16,880
pb and ox in order to make am
 

663
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,629
pb and ox in order to make am
so rx is part of am and ox is part of a

664
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:20,639
so rx is part of am and ox is part of a
 

665
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,030
so rx is part of am and ox is part of a
different one p o okay

666
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,040
different one p o okay
 

667
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,350
different one p o okay
what makes ox again

668
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:25,360
what makes ox again
 

669
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,269
what makes ox again
uh

670
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:27,279
uh
 

671
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,310
uh
i am and p.o

00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:30,320
i am and p.o
 

673
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,110
i am and p.o
okay wait what makes the ones

674
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:33,120
okay wait what makes the ones
 

675
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,069
okay wait what makes the ones
uh

676
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:34,079
uh
 

677
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,509
uh
what is that

678
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:35,519
what is that
 

679
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,990
what is that
wait when you say what makes ox um like

680
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:38,000
wait when you say what makes ox um like
 

681
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,230
wait when you say what makes ox um like
there's nothing here that says ox is

682
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:40,240
there's nothing here that says ox is
 

683
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,030
there's nothing here that says ox is
made by this and this but you can split

684
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:43,040
made by this and this but you can split
 

685
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,710
made by this and this but you can split
um away out of two other ones

686
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:46,720
um away out of two other ones
 

687
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,910
um away out of two other ones
okay so what

688
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:47,920

maybe i need to find one um
i still lever for that one

2742
00:58:08,710 --> 00:58:08,720
i still lever for that one
 

2743
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,789
i still lever for that one
the lever on the lever i have the lever

2744
00:58:10,789 --> 00:58:10,799
the lever on the lever i have the lever
 

2745
00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:12,069
the lever on the lever i have the lever
for that one it's

2746
00:58:12,069 --> 00:58:12,079
for that one it's
 

2747
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:15,030
for that one it's
like i can move it from oh can you do it

2748
00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:15,040
like i can move it from oh can you do it
 

2749
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:17,670
like i can move it from oh can you do it
okay well the arrow looks real okay okay

2750
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:17,680
okay well the arrow looks real okay okay
 

2751
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:20,549
okay well the arrow looks real okay okay
okay oh all right i see

2752
00:58:20,549 --> 00:58:20,559
okay oh all right i see
 

2753
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:22,950
okay oh all right i see
uh so when you trigger the lever what it

2754
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:22,960
uh so when you trigger the lever what it
 

2755
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,670
uh so when you trigger the lever what it
does is it does correspond to like the

2756
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:25,680
does is it does correspond to like the
 

2757
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,829
does is it does correspond to like the
yellow one like you said oh it

2758
00:58:27,829 --> 00:58:27,839
yellow one like you said oh it
 

2759
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:30,069
yellow one like you said oh it
corresponds to it but what happens is

2760
00:58:30,069 --> 00:58:30,079
corresponds to it but what happens is
 

2761
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:31,430
corresponds to it but what happens is
that um

2762
00:58:31,430 --> 00:58:31,440
that um
 

2763
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,510
that um
it switches the

2764
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:33,520
it switches the
 

2765
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,190
it switches the
rotation so

2766
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:35,200
rotation so
 

2767
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,829
rotation so
now instead of turning uh clockwise it's

2768
00:58:37,829 --> 00:58:37,839
now instead of turning uh clockwise it's
 

2769
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:39,910
now instead of turning uh clockwise it's
turning counterclockwise

2770
00:58:39,910 --> 00:58:39,920
turning counterclockwise
 

2771
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,910
turning counterclockwise
now i have three of them facing the same

2772
00:58:41,910 --> 00:58:41,920
now i have three of them facing the same
 

2773
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:44,470
now i have three of them facing the same
direction and i suppose maybe i'm

2774
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:44,480
direction and i suppose maybe i'm
 

2775
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,309
direction and i suppose maybe i'm
supposed to copy

2776
00:58:46,309 --> 00:58:46,319
supposed to copy
 

2777
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:47,589
supposed to copy
like uh

2778
00:58:47,589 --> 00:58:47,599
like uh
 

2779

like uh
you think they should all be facing the

2780
00:58:48,870 --> 00:58:48,880
you think they should all be facing the
 

2781
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:51,589
you think they should all be facing the
same direction

2782
00:58:51,589 --> 00:58:51,599

never like gotten into it but i probably
 

5231
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:03,430
never like gotten into it but i probably
would like it i think

it's so funny yeah you're still in
 

5239
01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:13,189
it's so funny yeah you're still in
character i shouldn't be more in

5240

character i shouldn't be more in
 

5241
01:48:13,199 --> 01:48:15,030

character too
 

5243
01:48:15,040 --> 01:48:16,390
character too
it's a little surprising because usually

5244
01:48:16,390 --> 01:48:16,400
it's a little surprising because usually
 

5245
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:19,189
it's a little surprising because usually
i like like fantasy sort of books or

like recently i've been reading a book
 

5263
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:39,510
like recently i've been reading a book
about simulations oh and like uh

5264
01:48:39,510 --> 01:48:39,520
about simulations oh and like uh
 

5265
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:40,950
about simulations oh and like uh
simulations

5266
01:48:40,950 --> 01:48:40,960
simulations
 

5267
01:48:40,960 --> 01:48:42,790
simulations
the world building is pretty intense

5268
01:48:42,790 --> 01:48:42,800
the world building is pretty intense
 

5269
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:44,709
the world building is pretty intense
yeah it's about building a simulation

5270
01:48:44,709 --> 01:48:44,719
yeah it's about building a simulation
 

5271
01:48:44,719 --> 01:48:45,830
yeah it's about building a simulation
that

5272
01:48:45,830 --> 01:48:45,840
that
 

5273
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:47,669
that
is complicated but essentially they're

5274
01:48:47,669 --> 01:48:47,679
is complicated but essentially they're
 

5275
01:48:47,679 --> 01:48:49,910
is complicated but essentially they're
like creating these virtual building

5276
01:48:49,910 --> 01:48:49,920
like creating these virtual building
 

5277
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:51,990
like creating these virtual building
blocks of life where they go through

5278
01:48:51,990 --> 01:48:52,000
blocks of life where they go through
 

5279
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:55,030
blocks of life where they go through
explaining like how they make a from an

5280
01:48:55,030 --> 01:48:55,040
explaining like how they make a from an
 

5281
01:48:55,040 --> 01:48:57,910
explaining like how they make a from an
atomic level create atoms virtually and

5282
01:48:57,910 --> 01:48:57,920
atomic level create atoms virtually and
 

5283
01:48:57,920 --> 01:48:59,350
atomic level create atoms virtually and
how they kind of

5284
01:48:59,350 --> 01:48:59,360
how they kind of
 

5285
01:48:59,360 --> 01:49:01,669
how they kind of
uh evolve into you know like more

5286
01:49:01,669 --> 01:49:01,679
uh evolve into you know like more
 

5287
01:49:01,679 --> 01:49:07,270
uh evolve into you know like more
advanced things from there and i guess

5288
01:49:07,270 --> 01:49:07,280

 

5289
01:49:07,280 --> 01:49:08,390

yeah it's

5290
01:49:08,390 --> 01:49:08,400
yeah it's
 

5291
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:12,550
yeah it's
it's a bit much sometimes that's

5292
01:49:12,550 --> 01:49:12,560
it's a bit much sometimes that's
 

5293
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:13,750
it's a bit much sometimes that's
that's probably not something that i

5294
01:49:13,750 --> 01:49:13,760
that's probably not something that i
 

5295
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:17,430
that's probably not something that i
would pick out of the shelf

5296
01:49:17,430 --> 01:49:17,440

 

5297
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:18,629

i'm just trying to get through it but

5298
01:49:18,629 --> 01:49:18,639
i'm just trying to get through it but
 

5299
01:49:18,639 --> 01:49:20,229
i'm just trying to get through it but
it's kind of interesting because i i

5300
01:49:20,229 --> 01:49:20,239
it's kind of interesting because i i
 

5301
01:49:20,239 --> 01:49:21,589
it's kind of interesting because i i
like reading it because it talks about

5302
01:49:21,589 --> 01:49:21,599
like reading it because it talks about
 

5303
01:49:21,599 --> 01:49:23,750
like reading it because it talks about
like some time relativity stuff and like

5304
01:49:23,750 --> 01:49:23,760
like some time relativity stuff and like
 

5305
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:25,669
like some time relativity stuff and like
going through experiments because when

5306
01:49:25,669 --> 01:49:25,679
going through experiments because when
 

5307
01:49:25,679 --> 01:49:27,669
going through experiments because when
you're uploaded to that virtual world

5308
01:49:27,669 --> 01:49:27,679
you're uploaded to that virtual world
 

5309
01:49:27,679 --> 01:49:29,910
you're uploaded to that virtual world
like uh you experience time differently

5310
01:49:29,910 --> 01:49:29,920
like uh you experience time differently
 

5311
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:30,709
like uh you experience time differently
so

5312
01:49:30,709 --> 01:49:30,719
so
 

5313
01:49:30,719 --> 01:49:32,950
so
that's pretty interesting you know

5314
01:49:32,950 --> 01:49:32,960
that's pretty interesting you know
 

5315
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:35,510
that's pretty interesting you know
right now when you're talking to me

5316
01:49:35,510 --> 01:49:35,520
right now when you're talking to me
 

5317

5323
01:49:40,239 --> 01:49:43,750
all that goes through my head is like
cryptic signs

5324
01:49:43,750 --> 01:49:43,760
cryptic signs
 

5325
01:49:43,760 --> 01:49:45,430
cryptic signs
i didn't understand english it was just

5326
01:49:45,430 --> 01:49:45,440
i didn't understand english it was just
 

5327

but maybe maybe we'll pick up
 

5345
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:09,589
but maybe maybe we'll pick up
another book after that one and then

5346
01:50:09,589 --> 01:50:09,599
another book after that one and then
 

5347
01:50:09,599 --> 01:50:11,589
another book after that one and then
another who knows who else maybe

5348
01:50:11,589 --> 01:50:11,599
another who knows who else maybe
 

5349

maybe i'll
 

5351
01:50:13,119 --> 01:50:16,709
maybe i'll
get caught in the web of books

5352
01:50:16,709 --> 01:50:16,719
get caught in the web of books
 

5353
01:50:16,719 --> 01:50:18,950
get caught in the web of books
maybe because i'm running out of netflix

5354
01:50:18,950 --> 01:50:18,960
maybe because i'm running out of netflix
 

5355
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:19,669
maybe because i'm running out of netflix
so

5356

you can't run out i mean if you run out
 

5361
01:50:23,679 --> 01:50:24,870
you can't run out i mean if you run out
of netflix you just go to another

5362
01:50:24,870 --> 01:50:24,880
of netflix you just go to another
 

5363
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:26,390
of netflix you just go to another
subscription service yeah i'm running

5406
01:51:09,430 --> 01:51:09,440
i'm in the middle of one right now i'm
 

5407
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:12,390
i'm in the middle of one right now i'm
not gonna mention any any cases
