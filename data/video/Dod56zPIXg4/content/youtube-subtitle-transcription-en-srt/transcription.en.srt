01:10:21,149 --> 01:10:21,159
box and it was falling apart so I got
 

2365
01:10:21,159 --> 01:10:23,990

an hour or so am I like 50% through at
 

6995
03:16:15,840 --> 03:16:18,550
an hour or so am I like 50% through at
least

6996
03:16:18,550 --> 03:16:18,560

6997
03:16:18,560 --> 03:16:21,269

it feels like I'm pretty deep in it but

6998
03:16:21,269 --> 03:16:21,279
it feels like I'm pretty deep in it but
 

6999
03:16:21,279 --> 03:16:24,070
it feels like I'm pretty deep in it but
it's probably like get the transceiver

it's probably like get the transceiver
 

7001
03:16:24,080 --> 03:16:26,710
it's probably like get the transceiver
and then

7002
03:16:26,710 --> 03:16:26,720
and then
 

7003
03:16:26,720 --> 03:16:29,429
and then
memory and then the whole there will be

7004
03:16:29,429 --> 03:16:29,439
memory and then the whole there will be
 

7005
03:16:29,439 --> 03:16:37,030
memory and then the whole there will be
a whole plot twist a lot of other

7006
03:16:37,030 --> 03:16:37,040

 

7007
03:16:37,040 --> 03:16:40,550

these things came

7018
03:16:51,229 --> 03:16:51,239
these things came
 

7019
03:16:51,239 --> 03:16:53,630
these things came
from after the humans disappeared that

7020
03:16:53,630 --> 03:16:53,640
from after the humans disappeared that
 

7021
03:16:53,640 --> 03:16:59,670
from after the humans disappeared that
bacteria mutated growing eating way more

7022
03:16:59,670 --> 03:16:59,680

 

7023
03:16:59,680 --> 03:17:06,269

ah and now we have

7024
03:17:06,269 --> 03:17:06,279

7050
03:17:45,469 --> 03:17:45,479
over to this side and then run to the
 

7051
03:17:45,479 --> 03:17:47,030
over to this side and then run to the
other cuz I guess there's something

7052
03:17:47,030 --> 03:17:47,040
other cuz I guess there's something
 

7053
03:17:47,040 --> 03:17:49,229
other cuz I guess there's something
there that I can jump on this these

7054
03:17:49,229 --> 03:17:49,239
there that I can jump on this these
 

7055
03:17:49,239 --> 03:17:50,670
there that I can jump on this these
things

7056
03:17:50,670 --> 03:17:50,680
things
 

7057
03:17:50,680 --> 03:17:52,510
things
there

7058
03:17:52,510 --> 03:17:52,520
there
 

7059
03:17:52,520 --> 03:17:59,189
there
okay hacking to again let's see what

7060
03:17:59,189 --> 03:17:59,199

 

7061
03:17:59,199 --> 03:18:02,910

now I'm here and do
 

7067
03:18:11,160 --> 03:18:14,990
now I'm here and do
I do I hack it

7068
03:18:14,990 --> 03:18:15,000

 

7069
03:18:15,000 --> 03:18:21,429
