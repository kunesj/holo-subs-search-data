hours before the video has to go up and
 

527
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,430
hours before the video has to go up and
so the artist only had like that amount

00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:47,440
so the artist only had like that amount
 

529
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,029
so the artist only had like that amount
of time to draw it that was like the

530
00:19:50,029 --> 00:19:50,039
of time to draw it that was like the
 

531
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:53,270
of time to draw it that was like the
first year and then in this year the the

532
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:53,280
first year and then in this year the the
 

533
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,830
first year and then in this year the the
2023 year we tried to improve that by at

534
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:56,840
2023 year we tried to improve that by at
 

535
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,390
2023 year we tried to improve that by at
least having the girl tell us ahead of

536
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:00,400
least having the girl tell us ahead of
 

537
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,590
least having the girl tell us ahead of
time what they will do in the video so

538
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:03,600
time what they will do in the video so
 

539
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,430
time what they will do in the video so
that the artist can already draw ahead

540
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:05,440
that the artist can already draw ahead
 

541
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,310
that the artist can already draw ahead
of

542
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:07,320
of
 

543
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,310
of
time

544
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:09,320
time
 

545
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,630
time
um but that way it was sometimes maybe

546
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:12,640
um but that way it was sometimes maybe
 

547
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,990
um but that way it was sometimes maybe
not too accurate you know unless like

548
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:15,000
not too accurate you know unless like
 

549
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,310
not too accurate you know unless like
sometimes when the girls did bring their

550
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:16,320
sometimes when the girls did bring their
 

551
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,990
sometimes when the girls did bring their
vide sometime somehow early enough then

552
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:19,000
vide sometime somehow early enough then
 

553
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,549
vide sometime somehow early enough then
the artist was still able to uh you

at four we'll do zero here then we're at
 

4769
02:15:05,920 --> 02:15:08,830
at four we'll do zero here then we're at
six and then we'll do a minus oh my God
