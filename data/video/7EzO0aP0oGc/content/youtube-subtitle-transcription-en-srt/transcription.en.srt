376
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:46,480
distances but
 

377
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,110

huge distances but it's more of a
 

381
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:52,189
huge distances but it's more of a
problem of like

382
00:13:52,189 --> 00:13:52,199
problem of like
 

383
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:55,230

00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:57,720
go as a German even if you speak English
 

387
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,189
go as a German even if you speak English
you can go to an Italian or a French

388
00:14:00,189 --> 00:14:00,199
you can go to an Italian or a French
 

389
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:02,269
you can go to an Italian or a French
convention or Spanish convention and you

390
00:14:02,269 --> 00:14:02,279
convention or Spanish convention and you
 

391
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:04,749
convention or Spanish convention and you
you don't have an idea about anything

392
00:14:04,749 --> 00:14:04,759
you don't have an idea about anything
 

393
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:06,790
you don't have an idea about anything
that's going on in the panels they don't

394
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:06,800
that's going on in the panels they don't
 

395
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,509
that's going on in the panels they don't
speak English I mean maybe sometimes

396
00:14:09,509 --> 00:14:09,519
speak English I mean maybe sometimes
 

397
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,670

with like uh International guests

398
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:12,680
with like uh International guests
 

399
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:16,110
with like uh International guests
there's like English panels and then you

400
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:16,120
there's like English panels and then you
 

401
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,910
there's like English panels and then you
will understand it too but generally

402
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:17,920
will understand it too but generally
 

403
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,110
will understand it too but generally
it's not built for you right

404
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:20,120
it's not built for you right
 

405
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,470
it's not built for you right
so that's the bigger problem I think
