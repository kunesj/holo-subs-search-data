yourself bigger
 

2827
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,990
yourself bigger
while holding that i can't hear i can't

2828
01:09:49,990 --> 01:09:50,000
while holding that i can't hear i can't
 

2829
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,590
while holding that i can't hear i can't
but let me put it down and make it

2830
01:09:51,590 --> 01:09:51,600
but let me put it down and make it
 

2831
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:54,229
but let me put it down and make it
and then hold it and then come down oh

2832
01:09:54,229 --> 01:09:54,239
and then hold it and then come down oh
 

2833
01:09:54,239 --> 01:09:55,270
and then hold it and then come down oh
you can't hold it

2834
01:09:55,270 --> 01:09:55,280
you can't hold it
 

2835
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:58,390
you can't hold it
okay okay it's got to be this size

2836
01:09:58,390 --> 01:09:58,400
okay okay it's got to be this size
 

2837
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:02,229
okay okay it's got to be this size
yeah maybe come down for now okay

2838
01:10:02,229 --> 01:10:02,239
yeah maybe come down for now okay
 

2839
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:05,030
yeah maybe come down for now okay
oysha but i'm sure there's one up there

2840
01:10:05,030 --> 01:10:05,040
oysha but i'm sure there's one up there
 

2841
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:07,430
oysha but i'm sure there's one up there
too and it's probably made so that

2842
01:10:07,430 --> 01:10:07,440
too and it's probably made so that
 

2843
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:10,310
too and it's probably made so that
i can get up there because yeah i guess

2844
01:10:10,310 --> 01:10:10,320
i can get up there because yeah i guess
 

2845
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:10,870
i can get up there because yeah i guess
yeah

2846
01:10:10,870 --> 01:10:10,880
yeah
 

2847
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:13,110
yeah
you just have to get big now and get on

2848
01:10:13,110 --> 01:10:13,120
you just have to get big now and get on
 

2849
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:14,390
you just have to get big now and get on
that side

2850
01:10:14,390 --> 01:10:14,400
that side
 

2851
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:15,750
that side
i'm gonna set this down really quick

2852
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:15,760
i'm gonna set this down really quick
 

2853
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:18,790
i'm gonna set this down really quick
okay okay

2854
01:10:18,790 --> 01:10:18,800

 

2855
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:21,030

all right there we go you ready i'm

2856
01:10:21,030 --> 01:10:21,040
all right there we go you ready i'm
 

2857
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:24,390
all right there we go you ready i'm
ready

2858
01:10:24,390 --> 01:10:24,400

 

2859
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:26,950

oh there you go yeah that was the right

2860
01:10:26,950 --> 01:10:26,960
oh there you go yeah that was the right
 

2861
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:35,030
oh there you go yeah that was the right
thing to do

2862
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:35,040

 

2863
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:37,669

so probably one has to go over here

2864
01:10:37,669 --> 01:10:37,679
so probably one has to go over here
 

2865
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:39,189
so probably one has to go over here
close enough

2866
01:10:39,189 --> 01:10:39,199
close enough
 

2867
01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:41,189
close enough
and then one in the middle somewhere and

2868
01:10:41,189 --> 01:10:41,199
and then one in the middle somewhere and
 

2869
01:10:41,199 --> 01:10:44,310
and then one in the middle somewhere and
we can probably move them a bit more

2870
01:10:44,310 --> 01:10:44,320
we can probably move them a bit more
 

2871
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:48,149
we can probably move them a bit more
to like here maybe and that one a

2872
01:10:48,149 --> 01:10:48,159
to like here maybe and that one a
 

2873
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:50,709
to like here maybe and that one a
bit further i think they don't connect

2874
01:10:50,709 --> 01:10:50,719
bit further i think they don't connect
 

2875
01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:52,149
bit further i think they don't connect
here

2876
01:10:52,149 --> 01:10:52,159
here
 

2877
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:55,350
here
but maybe oh [\h__\h]

2878
01:10:55,350 --> 01:10:55,360
but maybe oh [\h__\h]
 

2879
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:57,669
but maybe oh [\h__\h]
let's make like a circuit i guess okay i

2880
01:10:57,669 --> 01:10:57,679
let's make like a circuit i guess okay i
 

2881
01:10:57,679 --> 01:10:59,270
let's make like a circuit i guess okay i
see so maybe it just needs to be a bit

2882
01:10:59,270 --> 01:10:59,280
see so maybe it just needs to be a bit
 

2883
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:00,630
see so maybe it just needs to be a bit
closer

2884
01:11:00,630 --> 01:11:00,640
closer
 

2885
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:03,430
closer
close as we can get it to be try and

2886
01:11:03,430 --> 01:11:03,440
close as we can get it to be try and
 

2887
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:05,110
close as we can get it to be try and
pull that as far as you can maybe

2888
01:11:05,110 --> 01:11:05,120
pull that as far as you can maybe
 

2889
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:08,630
pull that as far as you can maybe
yeah here here is another one

2890
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:08,640
yeah here here is another one
 

2891
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,830
yeah here here is another one
there okay then just leave that one

2892
01:11:10,830 --> 01:11:10,840
there okay then just leave that one
 

2893
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:17,669
there okay then just leave that one
there

2894
01:11:17,669 --> 01:11:17,679

 

2895
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:26,070

there is maximum

2896
01:11:26,070 --> 01:11:26,080
there is maximum
 

2897
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:28,709
there is maximum
yeah that's maximum hey that's not

2898
01:11:28,709 --> 01:11:28,719
yeah that's maximum hey that's not
 

2899
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:30,550
yeah that's maximum hey that's not
enough maybe there's more

2900
01:11:30,550 --> 01:11:30,560
enough maybe there's more
 

2901
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:32,470
enough maybe there's more
yeah there must be more what's so like

2902
01:11:32,470 --> 01:11:32,480
yeah there must be more what's so like
 

2903
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:34,470
yeah there must be more what's so like
we haven't gone over there over here

2904
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:34,480
we haven't gone over there over here
