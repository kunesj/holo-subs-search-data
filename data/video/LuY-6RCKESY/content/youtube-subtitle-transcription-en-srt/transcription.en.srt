rule of thumb is to have two people on

428
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:09,480
rule of thumb is to have two people on
 

429
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,750
rule of thumb is to have two people on
on a skill each so like one backup one

430
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:13,760
on a skill each so like one backup one
 

431
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,310
on a skill each so like one backup one
and then one other for like when they're

432
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:15,320
and then one other for like when they're
 

433
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,310
and then one other for like when they're
not online so yeah you can take up

434
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:17,320
not online so yeah you can take up
 

435
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,829
not online so yeah you can take up
farming I'll try to get a farm going all

436
00:13:20,829 --> 00:13:20,839
farming I'll try to get a farm going all
 

437
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:23,269

right I watch the video well actually to
 

439
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,990
right I watch the video well actually to
be precise I watched one minute

440
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:26,000
be precise I watched one minute
 

441
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,629
be precise I watched one minute
of that's good enough

442
00:13:29,629 --> 00:13:29,639
of that's good enough
 

443
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:31,230
of that's good enough
okay and hopefully we'll find more

444
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:31,240
okay and hopefully we'll find more
 

445
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,389

with us and
then that would be useful where's the

582
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:44,000
then that would be useful where's the
 

583
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,269
then that would be useful where's the
issue really that we don't have enough

584

the same time uh efficiently I think
 

591
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,470
the same time uh efficiently I think
that and I think the issue is we're not

592
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:52,480
that and I think the issue is we're not
 

593
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,069
that and I think the issue is we're not
home enough to food and we don't have

be no Zoom

7342
03:06:19,710 --> 03:06:19,720
be no Zoom
 

7343
03:06:19,720 --> 03:06:22,710
be no Zoom
around

7344
03:06:22,710 --> 03:06:22,720
around
 

7345
03:06:22,720 --> 03:06:25,269
around
Zoomies I'll be the fastest in these

7346
03:06:25,269 --> 03:06:25,279
Zoomies I'll be the fastest in these
 

7347
03:06:25,279 --> 03:06:28,469
Zoomies I'll be the fastest in these
lands for now I'll make more though I

7348
03:06:28,469 --> 03:06:28,479
lands for now I'll make more though I
 

7349
03:06:28,479 --> 03:06:31,550
lands for now I'll make more though I
think I can make a couple

7350
03:06:31,550 --> 03:06:31,560
think I can make a couple
 

7351
03:06:31,560 --> 03:06:35,590
think I can make a couple
maybe Ranger outfit that looks

7352
03:06:35,590 --> 03:06:35,600
maybe Ranger outfit that looks
 

7353
03:06:35,600 --> 03:06:39,429
maybe Ranger outfit that looks
good let me see if I can make some

7354
03:06:39,429 --> 03:06:39,439
good let me see if I can make some
 

7355
03:06:39,439 --> 03:06:42,030
good let me see if I can make some
bandages it gets laggy when I go into

7356

bandages it gets laggy when I go into
 

7357
03:06:42,040 --> 03:06:45,790
bandages it gets laggy when I go into
that it's generally laggy here weird

7358
03:06:45,790 --> 03:06:45,800
that it's generally laggy here weird
 

7359
03:06:45,800 --> 03:06:50,030

03:06:52,269 --> 03:06:52,279
oh it's a little better for Max Health
 

7363
03:06:52,279 --> 03:06:56,309
oh it's a little better for Max Health
Wheels oh we might not have so many

7364
03:06:56,309 --> 03:06:56,319

 

7365
03:06:56,319 --> 03:06:59,910

wheels didn't we have more can you craft
 

7367
03:06:59,920 --> 03:07:03,750
wheels didn't we have more can you craft
a wheel there Wheels all over the place

7368
03:07:03,750 --> 03:07:03,760
a wheel there Wheels all over the place
 

7369
03:07:03,760 --> 03:07:06,630
a wheel there Wheels all over the place
all around the desert it seems like but

7370
03:07:06,630 --> 03:07:06,640
all around the desert it seems like but
 

7371
03:07:06,640 --> 03:07:08,150
all around the desert it seems like but
can you actually pick those up or do you

7372
03:07:08,150 --> 03:07:08,160
can you actually pick those up or do you
 

7373
03:07:08,160 --> 03:07:09,150
can you actually pick those up or do you
have to

7374
03:07:09,150 --> 03:07:09,160
have to
 

7375
03:07:09,160 --> 03:07:12,150
have to
like I'll see if I see another one out

7376
03:07:12,150 --> 03:07:12,160
like I'll see if I see another one out
 

7377
03:07:12,160 --> 03:07:15,870

normal then they're probably sad and
thirsty and taking them out of the I

7390
03:07:34,229 --> 03:07:34,239
thirsty and taking them out of the I
 

7391
03:07:34,239 --> 03:07:36,790
thirsty and taking them out of the I
guess they are probably sad and thirsty

7392
03:07:36,790 --> 03:07:36,800
guess they are probably sad and thirsty
 

7393
03:07:36,800 --> 03:07:42,229

7395
03:07:42,239 --> 03:07:45,429

it okay I think I think tires only give

7396
03:07:45,429 --> 03:07:45,439
it okay I think I think tires only give
 

7397
03:07:45,439 --> 03:07:48,110

03:07:54,750 --> 03:07:54,760
more and we can make Wheels ourselves
 

7405
03:07:54,760 --> 03:07:57,229
more and we can make Wheels ourselves
with a oh quite a oh it takes a few

the moment
 

10855
04:37:42,160 --> 04:37:44,310
the moment
and it just feels weird to cook dinner

10856
04:37:44,310 --> 04:37:44,320
and it just feels weird to cook dinner
