okay so today we're playing draw and
 

381
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,509
okay so today we're playing draw and
guess

382
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:43,519
guess
 

383
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,990
guess
there are two game modes there's one

384
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:46,000
there are two game modes there's one
 

385
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,389
there are two game modes there's one
where basically one person draws we all

386
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:48,399
where basically one person draws we all
 

387
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,710
where basically one person draws we all
look at it and we guess at the same time

388
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:50,720
look at it and we guess at the same time
 

389
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,949
look at it and we guess at the same time
in the chat what it is

390
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:52,959
in the chat what it is
 

391
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,350
in the chat what it is
until we get it right i guess i know

392
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:55,360
until we get it right i guess i know
 

393
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,550
