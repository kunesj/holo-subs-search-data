the default meet four thousand which
 

935
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,690
the default meet four thousand which
kind of adds up to roughly that

936
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:05,700
kind of adds up to roughly that
 

937
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,769

right to the Chateau Brio a la carte uh

938
00:27:09,769 --> 00:27:09,779
right to the Chateau Brio a la carte uh

00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:11,100
one
 

941
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,190
one
but you know if they would have just put

942
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:13,200
but you know if they would have just put
 

943
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,769
but you know if they would have just put
the Chateau Brio extra on there

944
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:15,779
the Chateau Brio extra on there
 

945
00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:18,890
the Chateau Brio extra on there
for that final price I wouldn't have

946
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:18,900
for that final price I wouldn't have
 

947
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,510
for that final price I wouldn't have
been confused but I was especially

948
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:20,520
been confused but I was especially
 

949
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,210
been confused but I was especially
confused because the course was supposed

950
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:23,220
confused because the course was supposed
 

951
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,210
confused because the course was supposed
to include

952
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:25,220
to include
 

953
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:30,230
to include
the the basic meat anyway and yet

954
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:30,240
the the basic meat anyway and yet
 

955
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,950
the the basic meat anyway and yet
on the bill it's listed as course uh uh

956
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:33,960
on the bill it's listed as course uh uh

a hundred bucks
 

959
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,409
a hundred bucks
then the basic meat separately extra

960
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:39,419
then the basic meat separately extra
 

961
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:41,210
then the basic meat separately extra
money costing

962
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:41,220

and the Chateaubriand

964
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:44,940
and the Chateaubriand
 

965
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,850
and the Chateaubriand
you get what I'm saying why I was so

966
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:46,860
you get what I'm saying why I was so
 

967
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,730
you get what I'm saying why I was so
confused about it

968
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:49,740
confused about it
 

969
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,950
confused about it
I mean the price was also shock but in

970
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:51,960
I mean the price was also shock but in
 

971
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,230
I mean the price was also shock but in
hindsight I understand the pricing that

972
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:54,240
hindsight I understand the pricing that
 

973
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,570
hindsight I understand the pricing that
you know I misunderstood that the

974
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:56,580
you know I misunderstood that the
 

975
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:59,470
you know I misunderstood that the
Chateaubriand only costs

976
00:27:59,470 --> 00:27:59,480
Chateaubriand only costs
 

977
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:05,570
Chateaubriand only costs
4400 if you just upgrade your course

978
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:05,580
4400 if you just upgrade your course
 

979
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:08,510
4400 if you just upgrade your course
I did not expect it to be double that

980
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:08,520
I did not expect it to be double that
 

981
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:14,149
I did not expect it to be double that
when uh you order extra

982
00:28:14,149 --> 00:28:14,159

 

983
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,730

I get that but the way it was listed was

984
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:16,740
I get that but the way it was listed was
 

985
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,230
I get that but the way it was listed was
just so confusing I thought they made a

986
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:18,240
just so confusing I thought they made a
 

987
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,130
just so confusing I thought they made a
mistake

988
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:19,140
mistake
 

989
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:22,250
mistake
and I do think that it's it it makes no

990
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:22,260
and I do think that it's it it makes no
 

991
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,269
and I do think that it's it it makes no
sense

992
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:23,279
sense
 

993
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,930
sense
in terms of how it was listed Pam

994
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:26,940
in terms of how it was listed Pam
 

995
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,930
in terms of how it was listed Pam
no it was a Teppanyaki well it's still

996
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:29,940
no it was a Teppanyaki well it's still
 

997
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,510
no it was a Teppanyaki well it's still
worth it was good the Chateau Brian was

998
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:32,520
worth it was good the Chateau Brian was
 

999
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,149
worth it was good the Chateau Brian was
incredibly good but in hindsight um it

1000
00:28:35,149 --> 00:28:35,159
incredibly good but in hindsight um it
 

1001
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:38,149
incredibly good but in hindsight um it
was actually in general way more than in

1002
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:38,159
was actually in general way more than in
 

1003
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,549
was actually in general way more than in
other Teppanyaki places it felt like way

1004
00:28:40,549 --> 00:28:40,559
other Teppanyaki places it felt like way
 

1005
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,350
other Teppanyaki places it felt like way
more meat than another Teppanyaki places

1006
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:42,360
more meat than another Teppanyaki places
 

1007
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,430
more meat than another Teppanyaki places
so

1008
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:43,440
so
 

1009
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,289
so
I could have just

1010
00:28:45,289 --> 00:28:45,299
I could have just
 

1011
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:48,470
I could have just
gone with the Chateaubriand only and and

1012
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:48,480
gone with the Chateaubriand only and and
 

1013
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,810
gone with the Chateaubriand only and and
if I knew it was gonna cost that much I

1014
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:50,820
if I knew it was gonna cost that much I
 

1015
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,490
if I knew it was gonna cost that much I

um you know it they they teach you step
 

3519
01:36:03,060 --> 01:36:04,610
um you know it they they teach you step
by step so I think it will turn out

3520
01:36:04,610 --> 01:36:04,620
by step so I think it will turn out
 

3521
01:36:04,620 --> 01:36:06,169
by step so I think it will turn out
really pretty and if you especially if

3522
01:36:06,169 --> 01:36:06,179
really pretty and if you especially if
 

3523
01:36:06,179 --> 01:36:08,330
really pretty and if you especially if
you go for something more abstract then

3524
01:36:08,330 --> 01:36:08,340
you go for something more abstract then
 

3525
01:36:08,340 --> 01:36:09,890
you go for something more abstract then
I don't think you can do much wrong what
