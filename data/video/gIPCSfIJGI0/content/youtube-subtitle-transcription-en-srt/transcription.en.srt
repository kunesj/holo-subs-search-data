2020 because it's so hard to compare

those two years
 

3795
01:40:22,239 --> 01:40:24,070
those two years
because i was in japan most of the time

3796
01:40:24,070 --> 01:40:24,080
because i was in japan most of the time
 

3797
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:27,030
because i was in japan most of the time
in 2020

01:40:27,030 --> 01:40:27,040

 

3799
01:40:27,040 --> 01:40:30,310

uh

3801
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:33,189

and so i think it's uh not really

3802
01:40:33,189 --> 01:40:33,199
and so i think it's uh not really
 

3803
01:40:33,199 --> 01:40:35,669
and so i think it's uh not really
comparable

3804
01:40:35,669 --> 01:40:35,679
comparable
 

3805
01:40:35,679 --> 01:40:40,070
comparable

what was all of that for then up until
 

5257
02:18:47,519 --> 02:18:49,589
what was all of that for then up until

02:18:49,589 --> 02:18:49,599
now
 

5259
02:18:49,599 --> 02:18:51,990

i mean is it officially related prologue

5260
02:18:51,990 --> 02:18:52,000
i mean is it officially related prologue
 

5261
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:55,030
i mean is it officially related prologue
no it isn't right

5262
02:18:55,030 --> 02:18:55,040
no it isn't right
 

5263
02:18:55,040 --> 02:18:56,629
no it isn't right
but you take it as a prologue because

5264
02:18:56,629 --> 02:18:56,639
but you take it as a prologue because
 

5265
02:18:56,639 --> 02:18:58,389
but you take it as a prologue because
everything after that is so much more

5266
02:18:58,389 --> 02:18:58,399
everything after that is so much more
 

5267
02:18:58,399 --> 02:19:06,549
everything after that is so much more
important i guess

5268
02:19:06,549 --> 02:19:06,559
important i guess
 

5269
02:19:06,559 --> 02:19:08,309
