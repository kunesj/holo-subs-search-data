them in the pizza oven instead of the
 

14033
07:06:00,780 --> 07:06:03,530
them in the pizza oven instead of the

14034
07:06:03,530 --> 07:06:03,540
normal oven and apparently
 

14035
07:06:03,540 --> 07:06:05,270

I was maybe in Japan

14038
07:06:07,368 --> 07:06:07,378
I was maybe in Japan
 

14039
07:06:07,378 --> 07:06:09,110
I was maybe in Japan
but apparently it tasted really

14040
07:06:09,110 --> 07:06:09,120
but apparently it tasted really
 

14041
07:06:09,120 --> 07:06:12,468
but apparently it tasted really
disgusting

14043
07:06:12,478 --> 07:06:15,890

so I think it's maybe something like you

14044
07:06:15,890 --> 07:06:15,900
so I think it's maybe something like you
 

14045
07:06:15,900 --> 07:06:18,288
so I think it's maybe something like you
know in in normal Pizza Oven it would

14046
07:06:18,288 --> 07:06:18,298
know in in normal Pizza Oven it would
 

14047
07:06:18,298 --> 07:06:20,930
know in in normal Pizza Oven it would
take like 12 minutes or so

14048
07:06:20,930 --> 07:06:20,940
take like 12 minutes or so
 

14049
07:06:20,940 --> 07:06:23,150
take like 12 minutes or so
in a normal oven and then the pizza oven

14050
07:06:23,150 --> 07:06:23,160
in a normal oven and then the pizza oven
 

14051
07:06:23,160 --> 07:06:25,070
in a normal oven and then the pizza oven
you have to take it out after like

14052
07:06:25,070 --> 07:06:25,080
you have to take it out after like
