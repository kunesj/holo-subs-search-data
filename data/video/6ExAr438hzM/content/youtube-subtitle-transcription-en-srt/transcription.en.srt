05:51:38,948 --> 05:51:38,958
the reasoning behind it but it's not
 

11637
05:51:38,958 --> 05:51:41,110
the reasoning behind it but it's not
really like I'm forcing you guys so you

11638
05:51:41,110 --> 05:51:41,120
really like I'm forcing you guys so you
 

11639
05:51:41,120 --> 05:51:42,628
really like I'm forcing you guys so you
guys are already members I don't really

11640
05:51:42,628 --> 05:51:42,638
guys are already members I don't really
 

11641
05:51:42,638 --> 05:51:44,948
guys are already members I don't really
think there's much like really anyone

11642
05:51:44,948 --> 05:51:44,958
think there's much like really anyone
 

11643
05:51:44,958 --> 05:51:49,390
think there's much like really anyone
who's going to join right now to play uh

11644
05:51:49,390 --> 05:51:49,400
who's going to join right now to play uh

15100
07:25:49,590 --> 07:25:49,600

 

15101
07:25:49,600 --> 07:25:52,388

many yeah so many there there will be

15102
07:25:52,388 --> 07:25:52,398
many yeah so many there there will be
 

15103
07:25:52,398 --> 07:25:54,830
many yeah so many there there will be
like so many streams all the time there

15104
07:25:54,830 --> 07:25:54,840
like so many streams all the time there
 

15105
07:25:54,840 --> 07:25:57,190
like so many streams all the time there
will be a lot of overlapping as well I

15106
07:25:57,190 --> 07:25:57,200
will be a lot of overlapping as well I
 

15107
07:25:57,200 --> 07:26:01,388
will be a lot of overlapping as well I
think now that it's 11: instead of just

think now that it's 11: instead of just
 

15109
07:26:01,398 --> 07:26:04,830
think now that it's 11: instead of just
five and uh overlapping is definitely

15110
07:26:04,830 --> 07:26:04,840
five and uh overlapping is definitely
 

15111
07:26:04,840 --> 07:26:06,430
five and uh overlapping is definitely
inevitable

15112
07:26:06,430 --> 07:26:06,440
inevitable
 

15113
07:26:06,440 --> 07:26:09,990
inevitable
now and uh

15114
07:26:09,990 --> 07:26:10,000
