and the the reason why I'm stalling

280
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:15,120
and the the reason why I'm stalling
 

281
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,150
and the the reason why I'm stalling
right now is because

282
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:17,160
right now is because
 

283
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,750
right now is because
I had both of my joy-cons in my switch

284
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:20,760
I had both of my joy-cons in my switch
 

285
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,150
I had both of my joy-cons in my switch
inserted but apparently one of them

00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:23,160
inserted but apparently one of them
 

287
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:31,750
inserted but apparently one of them
didn't load so I'm stalling right now

I I originally I was thinking
 

4749
02:21:06,660 --> 02:21:08,690
I I originally I was thinking
um that if the PS5 arrives like it

4750
02:21:08,690 --> 02:21:08,700
um that if the PS5 arrives like it
 

4751
02:21:08,700 --> 02:21:10,250
um that if the PS5 arrives like it
should have arrived this week you know

4752

should have arrived this week you know
 

4753

so I was like even if the the

02:21:12,240 --> 02:21:13,910

think so

I think if I would stream at the same
 

4809
02:22:18,300 --> 02:22:19,730

4810
02:22:19,730 --> 02:22:19,740
time then we're gonna have issues like
 

4811
02:22:19,740 --> 02:22:22,990
time then we're gonna have issues like
with Neo automata for example again

4819
02:22:31,380 --> 02:22:34,610

then my PC might be better for it but

4820

then my PC might be better for it but
 

4821
02:22:34,620 --> 02:22:36,290
then my PC might be better for it but
if you think about the fact that I'm

if you think about the fact that I'm
 

4823
02:22:36,300 --> 02:22:38,809

also streaming it

also streaming it
 

4825

it runs great on PC now but anyway we're

05:52:39,170 --> 05:52:39,180
when I opened the packages up and all
 

12439
05:52:39,180 --> 05:52:41,990
when I opened the packages up and all
that I I genuinely thought that the

12440
05:52:41,990 --> 05:52:42,000
that I I genuinely thought that the
 

12441
05:52:42,000 --> 05:52:44,750
that I I genuinely thought that the
small dongles

12442
05:52:44,750 --> 05:52:44,760
small dongles
 

12443
05:52:44,760 --> 05:52:48,288
small dongles
um were just you know like uh for I

12444
05:52:48,288 --> 05:52:48,298
um were just you know like uh for I
 

12445
05:52:48,298 --> 05:52:50,570
um were just you know like uh for I
don't know charging like I don't know I

12446
05:52:50,570 --> 05:52:50,580
don't know charging like I don't know I
 

12447
05:52:50,580 --> 05:52:52,548
don't know charging like I don't know I
thought it was like an extra

12448
05:52:52,548 --> 05:52:52,558
thought it was like an extra
 

12449
05:52:52,558 --> 05:52:55,548
thought it was like an extra
dead because because it made those it

12450
05:52:55,548 --> 05:52:55,558
dead because because it made those it
 

12451
05:52:55,558 --> 05:52:57,590
dead because because it made those it
already made sense to me without those

12452
05:52:57,590 --> 05:52:57,600
already made sense to me without those
 

12453
05:52:57,600 --> 05:53:00,288
already made sense to me without those
like I was able to use them without the

12454
05:53:00,288 --> 05:53:00,298
like I was able to use them without the
 

12455
05:53:00,298 --> 05:53:02,990
like I was able to use them without the
dongles like like like you have to

12456
05:53:02,990 --> 05:53:03,000
dongles like like like you have to
 

12457
05:53:03,000 --> 05:53:06,170
dongles like like like you have to
understand my my way of thinking a

12458
05:53:06,170 --> 05:53:06,180
understand my my way of thinking a
 

12459
05:53:06,180 --> 05:53:07,788
understand my my way of thinking a
little bit because the cables fit in

12460
05:53:07,788 --> 05:53:07,798
little bit because the cables fit in
 

12461
05:53:07,798 --> 05:53:10,730
little bit because the cables fit in
there without the dongle

12462
05:53:10,730 --> 05:53:10,740
there without the dongle
 

12463
05:53:10,740 --> 05:53:13,128
there without the dongle
like I was able to connect it already

12464
05:53:13,128 --> 05:53:13,138
like I was able to connect it already
 

12465
05:53:13,138 --> 05:53:17,150
like I was able to connect it already
without the dongle and the thing is the

12466
05:53:17,150 --> 05:53:17,160
without the dongle and the thing is the
 

12467
05:53:17,160 --> 05:53:19,970
without the dongle and the thing is the
they worked without the dongle as well I

12468
05:53:19,970 --> 05:53:19,980
they worked without the dongle as well I
 

12469
05:53:19,980 --> 05:53:22,430
they worked without the dongle as well I
just couldn't get more than two to work

12470
05:53:22,430 --> 05:53:22,440
just couldn't get more than two to work
 

12471
05:53:22,440 --> 05:53:25,128
just couldn't get more than two to work
you understand like The Trackers that

12472
05:53:25,128 --> 05:53:25,138
you understand like The Trackers that
 

12473
05:53:25,138 --> 05:53:27,410
you understand like The Trackers that
have free trackers and two controllers

12474
05:53:27,410 --> 05:53:27,420
have free trackers and two controllers
 

12475
05:53:27,420 --> 05:53:29,090
have free trackers and two controllers
and the three trackers needed this

12476
05:53:29,090 --> 05:53:29,100
and the three trackers needed this
 

12477
05:53:29,100 --> 05:53:31,670
and the three trackers needed this
dongle attached to it additionally which

12478
05:53:31,670 --> 05:53:31,680
dongle attached to it additionally which
 

12479
05:53:31,680 --> 05:53:34,930
dongle attached to it additionally which
is like a really really tiny tiny thingy

12480
05:53:34,930 --> 05:53:34,940
is like a really really tiny tiny thingy
 

12481
05:53:34,940 --> 05:53:37,628
is like a really really tiny tiny thingy
and

12482
05:53:37,628 --> 05:53:37,638
and
 

12483
05:53:37,638 --> 05:53:40,250
and
I I

12484
05:53:40,250 --> 05:53:40,260
I I
 

12485
05:53:40,260 --> 05:53:42,708
I I
I use it without and it worked it worked

12486
05:53:42,708 --> 05:53:42,718
I use it without and it worked it worked
 

12487
05:53:42,718 --> 05:53:44,990
I use it without and it worked it worked
so I thought the issue was I don't know

12488
05:53:44,990 --> 05:53:45,000
so I thought the issue was I don't know
 

12489
05:53:45,000 --> 05:53:46,128
so I thought the issue was I don't know
something

12490
05:53:46,128 --> 05:53:46,138
something
 

12491
05:53:46,138 --> 05:53:48,490
something
but I didn't think of the dongle because

12492
05:53:48,490 --> 05:53:48,500
but I didn't think of the dongle because
 

12493
05:53:48,500 --> 05:53:51,410
but I didn't think of the dongle because
in general they worked so

12494
05:53:51,410 --> 05:53:51,420
in general they worked so
 

12495
05:53:51,420 --> 05:53:53,330
in general they worked so
they just didn't get I couldn't just

12496
05:53:53,330 --> 05:53:53,340
they just didn't get I couldn't just
 

12497
05:53:53,340 --> 05:53:55,510
they just didn't get I couldn't just
connect more than two at once

12498
05:53:55,510 --> 05:53:55,520
connect more than two at once
 

12499
05:53:55,520 --> 05:53:58,430
connect more than two at once
dongle dongle

12500
05:53:58,430 --> 05:53:58,440
dongle dongle
 

12501
05:53:58,440 --> 05:54:00,170
dongle dongle
yeah and then the thing is also that

12502
05:54:00,170 --> 05:54:00,180
yeah and then the thing is also that
 

12503
05:54:00,180 --> 05:54:03,530
yeah and then the thing is also that

otherwise we would have been [\h__\h]

12534
05:54:39,288 --> 05:54:39,298
otherwise we would have been [\h__\h]
 

12535
05:54:39,298 --> 05:54:41,150
otherwise we would have been [\h__\h]
until the end because we just couldn't

12536
05:54:41,150 --> 05:54:41,160
until the end because we just couldn't
 

12537
05:54:41,160 --> 05:54:43,310
until the end because we just couldn't
figure it out on our own

12538
05:54:43,310 --> 05:54:43,320
figure it out on our own
 

12539
05:54:43,320 --> 05:54:47,570
figure it out on our own
yeah I guess it was just too obvious

12540
05:54:47,570 --> 05:54:47,580
yeah I guess it was just too obvious
 

12541
05:54:47,580 --> 05:54:49,970
yeah I guess it was just too obvious
to figure it out but I I did ask

12542
05:54:49,970 --> 05:54:49,980
to figure it out but I I did ask
 

12543
05:54:49,980 --> 05:54:54,830
to figure it out but I I did ask
beforehand I was like I'm in other other

12544
05:54:54,830 --> 05:54:54,840
beforehand I was like I'm in other other
 

12545
05:54:54,840 --> 05:54:57,170
beforehand I was like I'm in other other
people here do you think it's okay to

12546
05:54:57,170 --> 05:54:57,180
people here do you think it's okay to
 

12547
05:54:57,180 --> 05:54:59,448
people here do you think it's okay to
maybe ask because I know that there's a

12548
05:54:59,448 --> 05:54:59,458
maybe ask because I know that there's a
 

12549
05:54:59,458 --> 05:55:02,330
maybe ask because I know that there's a
lot of texting Savvy people in my

12550
05:55:02,330 --> 05:55:02,340
lot of texting Savvy people in my
 

12551
05:55:02,340 --> 05:55:03,830
lot of texting Savvy people in my
audience

12552
05:55:03,830 --> 05:55:03,840
audience
 

12553
05:55:03,840 --> 05:55:06,110
audience
do you think it's okay to ask and they

12554
05:55:06,110 --> 05:55:06,120
do you think it's okay to ask and they
 

12555
05:55:06,120 --> 05:55:09,110
do you think it's okay to ask and they
were like yeah yeah

12559
05:55:12,058 --> 05:55:14,750

yeah and yeah those teasers yeah I think

12560
05:55:14,750 --> 05:55:14,760
yeah and yeah those teasers yeah I think
 

12561
05:55:14,760 --> 05:55:16,810
yeah and yeah those teasers yeah I think
they were pretty obvious anyway

12562
05:55:16,810 --> 05:55:16,820
they were pretty obvious anyway
 

12563
05:55:16,820 --> 05:55:19,610
they were pretty obvious anyway
because at that point we had teasers out

12564
05:55:19,610 --> 05:55:19,620
because at that point we had teasers out
 

12565
05:55:19,620 --> 05:55:23,030
because at that point we had teasers out
already with us as a Wolfie

12566
05:55:23,030 --> 05:55:23,040
already with us as a Wolfie
 

12567
05:55:23,040 --> 05:55:26,050
already with us as a Wolfie
