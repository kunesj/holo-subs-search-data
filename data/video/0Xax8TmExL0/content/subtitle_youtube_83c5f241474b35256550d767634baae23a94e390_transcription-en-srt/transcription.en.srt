no unable to move what then we missed a

330
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:21,279
no unable to move what then we missed a
 

331
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,269

raid what does this mean for us that the

332
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:23,279
raid what does this mean for us that the
 

333
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,829
raid what does this mean for us that the
next raid will be super strong we're

334
00:14:25,829 --> 00:14:25,839
next raid will be super strong we're
 

335
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,030
next raid will be super strong we're
ready we're going to do it we're going

336
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:28,040

toy it strong together I think that it

338
00:14:31,949 --> 00:14:31,959
toy it strong together I think that it
 

339
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:33,629
toy it strong together I think that it
also has to do with our levels and stuff

340
00:14:33,629 --> 00:14:33,639
also has to do with our levels and stuff
 

341
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,629
also has to do with our levels and stuff
so since no one leveled up I think so

342
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:36,639
so since no one leveled up I think so
 

343
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,790
so since no one leveled up I think so
that's how it wasn't the better at least

344
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:38,800
that's how it wasn't the better at least

there's a big circle now
 

983
00:31:08,639 --> 00:31:10,190
there's a big circle now
mhm

984
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:10,200
mhm
 

985
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:14,629
mhm
um so we just you guys are in the circle

986
00:31:14,629 --> 00:31:14,639
um so we just you guys are in the circle
 

987
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:17,110
um so we just you guys are in the circle
so okay I guess I'll go a little bit

988
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:17,120
so okay I guess I'll go a little bit
 

989
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,470
so okay I guess I'll go a little bit
further so we have a better yeah Circle

990
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:20,480
further so we have a better yeah Circle
 

991
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,029
further so we have a better yeah Circle
radius you are right on the edge okay

992
00:31:24,029 --> 00:31:24,039
radius you are right on the edge okay
 

993
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:25,269
radius you are right on the edge okay
and

994

and
 

995
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:28,710
and
it's shouldn't be too bad then it's a

996
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:28,720
it's shouldn't be too bad then it's a
 

997
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,549
it's shouldn't be too bad then it's a
big radius uh-oh usually it shrinks the

998
00:31:32,549 --> 00:31:32,559
big radius uh-oh usually it shrinks the
 

999
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:35,950
big radius uh-oh usually it shrinks the
further down you go oh

1000
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:35,960

rock is the
 

1229
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:03,069
rock is the
the limit B yeah so the limit actually

1230
00:37:03,069 --> 00:37:03,079
the limit B yeah so the limit actually
 

1231
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:04,910
the limit B yeah so the limit actually
you can break the rock but you need a

1232
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:04,920
you can break the rock but you need a
 

1233
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:09,589
you can break the rock but you need a
better shovel you need to

1234
00:37:09,589 --> 00:37:09,599

 

1235
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,470

upgrade well again the the the whole

1236
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:12,480
upgrade well again the the the whole
 

1237
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,630
upgrade well again the the the whole
perimeter is really really big it's like

1238
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:14,640
perimeter is really really big it's like
 

1239
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,510
perimeter is really really big it's like
really really big

1240
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:16,520
really really big
 

1241
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:20,950
really really big
so I think yeah you guys aren't even at

1242
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:20,960
so I think yeah you guys aren't even at
 

1243
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,390
so I think yeah you guys aren't even at
the edge if you dig that L off okay it

1244
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:24,400
the edge if you dig that L off okay it
 

1245
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,030
the edge if you dig that L off okay it
is getting pretty late we're going to

1246
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:26,040
is getting pretty late we're going to
 

1247
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,030
is getting pretty late we're going to
have to be careful yeah

1248
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:28,040
have to be careful yeah
 

1249
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,430
have to be careful yeah
yeah wonder where we can maybe we can

1250
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:30,440
yeah wonder where we can maybe we can
 

1251
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,430
yeah wonder where we can maybe we can
find a place to hold up in the

1252
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:32,440
find a place to hold up in the
 

1253
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,430
find a place to hold up in the
night there was a house

1254
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:35,440
night there was a house

this
 

1259
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:43,589
this
hole maybe we could actually like make a

1260
00:37:43,589 --> 00:37:43,599
hole maybe we could actually like make a
 

1261
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:46,030
hole maybe we could actually like make a
literal you know like a little to like a

1262
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:46,040
literal you know like a little to like a
 

1263
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:49,150
literal you know like a little to like a
little oh like a little Hideout yeah

1264

00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,550
yeah yeah because like if they can't
they can't jump so if we have a place

1268
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:54,560
they can't jump so if we have a place
 

1269
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,309
they can't jump so if we have a place
that is in the middle of this but is

1270
00:37:56,309 --> 00:37:56,319
that is in the middle of this but is
 

1271
00:37:56,319 --> 00:37:59,750
that is in the middle of this but is
surrounded by hole they can't get to us

1272
00:37:59,750 --> 00:37:59,760
surrounded by hole they can't get to us
 

1273

somewhere over here you guys are on the
very edge of the perimeter now mhm um so

1302
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:35,280
very edge of the perimeter now mhm um so
 

1303
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:44,069
very edge of the perimeter now mhm um so
like somewhere around where I am

1304

close again this we're at the center of
the perimeter now so it should be around

1314
00:38:59,309 --> 00:38:59,319
the perimeter now so it should be around
 

1315
00:38:59,319 --> 00:39:02,670
the perimeter now so it should be around
here we dug that huge big

1316
