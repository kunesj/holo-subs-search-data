00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,870
hey if she's up there maybe she can like
like like put it above my head that was

958
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:06,880
like like put it above my head that was
 

959
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,669
like like put it above my head that was
my

960
00:24:07,669 --> 00:24:07,679
my
 

961
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,230
my
ideal plan that i'm in the water by the

962
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:10,240
ideal plan that i'm in the water by the
 

963
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,870
ideal plan that i'm in the water by the
ladder at the bottom and you put it

964
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:12,880
ladder at the bottom and you put it
 

965
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,110
ladder at the bottom and you put it
above my head you know what i mean so i

966
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:15,120
above my head you know what i mean so i
 

967
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,149
above my head you know what i mean so i
can just swoosh in there yeah that was

968
00:24:18,149 --> 00:24:18,159
can just swoosh in there yeah that was
 

969
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,110
can just swoosh in there yeah that was
my idea

970
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:21,120

 

971
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,070

well in my head i was like you know why

972
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:24,080
well in my head i was like you know why
 

973
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,990
well in my head i was like you know why
not be efficient and i mean

974
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:28,000
not be efficient and i mean
 

975
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:35,830
not be efficient and i mean
relaxing uh-huh yes

976
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:35,840

 

977
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,390

and then so there was the stair again

978
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:38,400
and then so there was the stair again
 

979
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,190
and then so there was the stair again
the stairs so there was like barely no

980
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:41,200
the stairs so there was like barely no
 

981
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,070
the stairs so there was like barely no
wind but like you know if i roll the

982
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:44,080
wind but like you know if i roll the
 

983
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,630
wind but like you know if i roll the
floatie down the stairs there's gonna be

984
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:46,640
floatie down the stairs there's gonna be
 

985
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,070
floatie down the stairs there's gonna be
like there right now

986
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:48,080

on this is the same seaplane that flew
 

3583
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:19,030
on this is the same seaplane that flew
us to the uh resort right and then we

3584
01:16:19,030 --> 01:16:19,040
us to the uh resort right and then we

would have been a problem yeah but
 

5033
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:09,270
would have been a problem yeah but
besides that i guess

5034
01:45:09,270 --> 01:45:09,280
besides that i guess
 

5035
01:45:09,280 --> 01:45:12,390
besides that i guess
a serious answer would be um

5036
01:45:12,390 --> 01:45:12,400
a serious answer would be um
 

5037
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:15,270
a serious answer would be um
to bring like the the proper headphone

5038
01:45:15,270 --> 01:45:15,280
to bring like the the proper headphone
 

5039

that would have been good yeah
 

5043
01:45:21,119 --> 01:45:24,870
that would have been good yeah
oh well yeah i guess so

5044
01:45:24,870 --> 01:45:24,880
oh well yeah i guess so
 

5045
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:26,870
oh well yeah i guess so
yeah but besides that i think we both

5046
01:45:26,870 --> 01:45:26,880

accordingly i wouldn't i still wouldn't

5486
01:54:10,950 --> 01:54:10,960

recommend going during the monsoon

5488
01:54:13,270 --> 01:54:13,280
recommend going during the monsoon
 

5489
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:15,109
recommend going during the monsoon
season because honestly

5490
01:54:15,109 --> 01:54:15,119
season because honestly
 

5491
01:54:15,119 --> 01:54:16,790
season because honestly
it wasn't even much cheaper you would

5492
01:54:16,790 --> 01:54:16,800
it wasn't even much cheaper you would
 

5493
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:18,470
it wasn't even much cheaper you would
expect that during that season it would

5494
01:54:18,470 --> 01:54:18,480
expect that during that season it would
 

5495
01:54:18,480 --> 01:54:20,950
expect that during that season it would
be cheaper but i feel like it was still

5496
01:54:20,950 --> 01:54:20,960
be cheaper but i feel like it was still
 

5497
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:22,870
be cheaper but i feel like it was still
very very expensive so

5498
01:54:22,870 --> 01:54:22,880
very very expensive so
 

5499
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:23,990
very very expensive so
it doesn't really make that much

5500
01:54:23,990 --> 01:54:24,000
it doesn't really make that much
 

5501
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,550
it doesn't really make that much
difference if you can't go during a

5502
01:54:26,550 --> 01:54:26,560
difference if you can't go during a
 

5503
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:27,910
difference if you can't go during a
normal season

5504
01:54:27,910 --> 01:54:27,920
normal season
 

5505
01:54:27,920 --> 01:54:29,750
normal season
go during the normal season not during

5506
01:54:29,750 --> 01:54:29,760
go during the normal season not during
 

5507
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:32,470
go during the normal season not during
the monsoon season do it i felt like the

5508
01:54:32,470 --> 01:54:32,480
the monsoon season do it i felt like the
 

5509
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:34,790
the monsoon season do it i felt like the
best weather was like the like day four

5510
01:54:34,790 --> 01:54:34,800
best weather was like the like day four
 

5511
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:36,550
best weather was like the like day four
because it started

5512
01:54:36,550 --> 01:54:36,560
because it started
 

5513
01:54:36,560 --> 01:54:38,629
because it started
getting better but also there was a

5514
01:54:38,629 --> 01:54:38,639
getting better but also there was a
 

5515
01:54:38,639 --> 01:54:40,709
getting better but also there was a
little bit of like clouds right so it

5516
01:54:40,709 --> 01:54:40,719
little bit of like clouds right so it
 

5517
01:54:40,719 --> 01:54:43,189
little bit of like clouds right so it
was just like not very hot but no rain

5518
01:54:43,189 --> 01:54:43,199
was just like not very hot but no rain
 

5519
01:54:43,199 --> 01:54:45,910

that makes me think like if you don't go
into if you don't go during the monsoon

5526
01:54:53,189 --> 01:54:53,199
into if you don't go during the monsoon

01:54:53,199 --> 01:54:55,510
into if you don't go during the monsoon
season but during the high whatever
