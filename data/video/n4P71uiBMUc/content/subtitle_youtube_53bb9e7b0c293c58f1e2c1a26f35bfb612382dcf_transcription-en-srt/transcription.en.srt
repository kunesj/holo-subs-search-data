require uh

414
00:12:59,430 --> 00:12:59,440

 

415
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,110

like a block down here yeah so the

416
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:03,120
like a block down here yeah so the
 

417
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,310
like a block down here yeah so the
the rail would be this height

418
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:06,320
the rail would be this height
 

419
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,990
the rail would be this height
where this block is here but because

420
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,000
where this block is here but because
 

421
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,670
where this block is here but because
your floor is

422
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:09,680
your floor is
 

423
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,310
your floor is
essentially this block you either have

424
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:12,320
essentially this block you either have
 

425
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,470
essentially this block you either have
to raise it on the inside by one block

426
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:14,480
to raise it on the inside by one block
 

427
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,230
to raise it on the inside by one block
so we can dig this out and then put it

428
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:16,240
so we can dig this out and then put it
 

429
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:16,629
so we can dig this out and then put it
back

430
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:16,639
back
 

431
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,150
back
because we need to get in there to be

432
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:18,160
because we need to get in there to be
 

433
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,310
because we need to get in there to be
able to put the rails on this level

434
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:20,320
able to put the rails on this level
 

435
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,230

437
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,190
so that uh it can collect the eggs at
the right height

438
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:25,200

 

439
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,590

i am confused uh what is the better
option mrs amelia watson

444
00:13:34,069 --> 00:13:34,079
option mrs amelia watson
 

445
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,150
option mrs amelia watson
um let me let me let me assess the

446
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,160
um let me let me let me assess the
 

447
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,590
um let me let me let me assess the
situation here

448
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:41,600

 

449
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,269

they have escaped now they will die

450
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:45,279
they have escaped now they will die
 

451
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,710
they have escaped now they will die
well i think what we could do here is

452
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:48,720
well i think what we could do here is
 

453
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,990
well i think what we could do here is
we'll kill like half of them

454
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:52,000
we'll kill like half of them
 

455
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,430
we'll kill like half of them
okay well i have enough eggs that's okay

456
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:55,440
okay well i have enough eggs that's okay
 

457
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,949
okay well i have enough eggs that's okay
why why would you kill half of them what

458
00:13:56,949 --> 00:13:56,959
why why would you kill half of them what
 

459
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,750
why why would you kill half of them what
is that necessary for okay okay okay so

460
00:13:59,750 --> 00:13:59,760
is that necessary for okay okay okay so
 

461
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,670
is that necessary for okay okay okay so
we'll we'll recording them off we'll

462
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:01,680
we'll we'll recording them off we'll
 

463
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,509
we'll we'll recording them off we'll
split it in half with a fence and then

464
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:03,519
split it in half with a fence and then
 

465
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,829
split it in half with a fence and then
we'll kill one half

466
00:14:05,829 --> 00:14:05,839
we'll kill one half
 

467
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,189
we'll kill one half
why so that we can fill that half with

468
00:14:09,189 --> 00:14:09,199
why so that we can fill that half with
 

469
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:09,670
why so that we can fill that half with
dirt

470
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:09,680
dirt
 

471
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,509
dirt
and then bring the other chickens from

472
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:11,519
and then bring the other chickens from
 

473
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,750
and then bring the other chickens from
the other side onto the raised dirt

474
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:13,760
the other side onto the raised dirt
 

475
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,550
the other side onto the raised dirt
and then we can fill it fill the other

476
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:16,560
and then we can fill it fill the other
 

477
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,230
and then we can fill it fill the other
half with dirt so that

478
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:18,240
half with dirt so that
 

479
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,590
half with dirt so that
we fill the whole thing but in in steps

480
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:21,600
we fill the whole thing but in in steps
 

481
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,110
we fill the whole thing but in in steps
uh chat would you say that that makes

3515
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:52,629
so i don't know exactly how to start it
so if you can think of a way to start it

3516
01:25:52,629 --> 01:25:52,639
so if you can think of a way to start it
 

3517
01:25:52,639 --> 01:25:55,750
so if you can think of a way to start it
you can do it i think i think right you

3518
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:55,760
you can do it i think i think right you
 

3519
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:56,870
you can do it i think i think right you
have the brain power

3520
01:25:56,870 --> 01:25:56,880
have the brain power
 

3521
01:25:56,880 --> 01:26:00,310
have the brain power
yes totally yeah i believe in you side

3522
01:26:00,310 --> 01:26:00,320
yes totally yeah i believe in you side
 

3523
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:01,750
yes totally yeah i believe in you side
down pyramid okay

3524
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:01,760
down pyramid okay
 

3525
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:06,390
down pyramid okay
but like on top uh from like the

3526
01:26:06,390 --> 01:26:06,400
but like on top uh from like the
 

3527
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:11,990
but like on top uh from like the
from like um how do i explain my thought

3528
01:26:11,990 --> 01:26:12,000

 

3529
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,830

uh the base here is that the smallest

3530
01:26:15,830 --> 01:26:15,840
uh the base here is that the smallest
 

3531
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:16,790
uh the base here is that the smallest
point of the

3532
01:26:16,790 --> 01:26:16,800
point of the
 

3533
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:20,070
point of the
tip of the pyramid or do i build a tiny

3534
01:26:20,070 --> 01:26:20,080
tip of the pyramid or do i build a tiny
 

3535
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:20,470
tip of the pyramid or do i build a tiny
tip

3536
01:26:20,470 --> 01:26:20,480
tip
 

3537
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:24,550
tip
on on top of that uh

3538
01:26:24,550 --> 01:26:24,560
on on top of that uh
 

3539
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:32,950
on on top of that uh
platform yeah i'll be right there okay

3540
01:26:32,950 --> 01:26:32,960

 

3541
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:39,669

all done i'm almost i'm almost there

3542
01:26:39,669 --> 01:26:39,679

 

3543
01:26:39,679 --> 01:26:41,110

i think you you have the right idea i

3544
01:26:41,110 --> 01:26:41,120
i think you you have the right idea i
 

3545
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:42,390
i think you you have the right idea i
think you guys already i just have to

3546
01:26:42,390 --> 01:26:42,400
think you guys already i just have to
 

3547
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:42,870
think you guys already i just have to
see what

3548
01:26:42,870 --> 01:26:42,880

3549
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:46,550
see what
what you're talking about

3550
01:26:46,550 --> 01:26:46,560

 

3551
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:50,550

just like see your explanation clearly

3552
01:26:50,550 --> 01:26:50,560
just like see your explanation clearly
 

3553
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:52,149
just like see your explanation clearly
there's nothing to see though it's just

3554
01:26:52,149 --> 01:26:52,159
there's nothing to see though it's just
 

3555
01:26:52,159 --> 01:26:53,830
there's nothing to see though it's just
imagination

3556
01:26:53,830 --> 01:26:53,840
imagination
 

3557
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:56,790
imagination
yeah yeah yeah you can like do a little

3558
01:26:56,790 --> 01:26:56,800
yeah yeah yeah you can like do a little
 

3559
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:57,270
yeah yeah yeah you can like do a little
guide

3560
01:26:57,270 --> 01:26:57,280
guide
 

3561
01:26:57,280 --> 01:27:01,750
guide
okay i'm coming up

3562
01:27:01,750 --> 01:27:01,760

 

3563
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:05,350

you know that deutsche technology is the

3564
01:27:05,350 --> 01:27:05,360
you know that deutsche technology is the
 

3565
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:05,750
you know that deutsche technology is the
best

3566
01:27:05,750 --> 01:27:05,760
best
 

3567
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:09,189
best
technology uh

3568
01:27:09,189 --> 01:27:09,199
technology uh
 

3569
01:27:09,199 --> 01:27:12,470
technology uh
okay i'm here okay question was

3570
01:27:12,470 --> 01:27:12,480
okay i'm here okay question was
 

3571
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:14,629
okay i'm here okay question was
it so if we're building an upside down

3572
01:27:14,629 --> 01:27:14,639
it so if we're building an upside down
 

3573
01:27:14,639 --> 01:27:15,669
it so if we're building an upside down
pyramid

3574
01:27:15,669 --> 01:27:15,679
pyramid
 

3575
01:27:15,679 --> 01:27:19,270
pyramid
um does is it like the tiny

3576
01:27:19,270 --> 01:27:19,280
um does is it like the tiny
 

3577
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:22,310
um does is it like the tiny
tip the one block tip of the pyramid

3578
01:27:22,310 --> 01:27:22,320
tip the one block tip of the pyramid
 

3579
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:24,070
tip the one block tip of the pyramid
is it supposed to be in the middle i'm

3580
01:27:24,070 --> 01:27:24,080
is it supposed to be in the middle i'm
 

3581
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:26,709
is it supposed to be in the middle i'm
thinking or is this huge platform

3582
01:27:26,709 --> 01:27:26,719
thinking or is this huge platform
 

3583
01:27:26,719 --> 01:27:30,470
thinking or is this huge platform
the smallest uh tip smallest

3584
01:27:30,470 --> 01:27:30,480
the smallest uh tip smallest
 

3585
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:34,550
the smallest uh tip smallest
uh whatever whatever

3586
01:27:34,550 --> 01:27:34,560
uh whatever whatever
 

3587
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:38,149
uh whatever whatever
let's see what's okay so

3588
01:27:38,149 --> 01:27:38,159

 

3589
01:27:38,159 --> 01:27:39,430

there this is this is the tip of the

3590
01:27:39,430 --> 01:27:39,440
there this is this is the tip of the
 

3591
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:42,580
there this is this is the tip of the
pyramid you see this

3592
01:27:42,580 --> 01:27:42,590

 

3593
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:45,110

[Laughter]

3594
01:27:45,110 --> 01:27:45,120
[Laughter]
 

3595
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:48,550
[Laughter]
okay so we'll build

3596
01:27:48,550 --> 01:27:48,560
okay so we'll build
 

3597
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:50,149
okay so we'll build
this is the perimeter of the tip and

3598
01:27:50,149 --> 01:27:50,159
this is the perimeter of the tip and
 

3599
01:27:50,159 --> 01:27:52,070
this is the perimeter of the tip and
then we build like staircases

3600
01:27:52,070 --> 01:27:52,080
then we build like staircases
 

3601
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:54,870
then we build like staircases
up you understand like uh we should be

3602
01:27:54,870 --> 01:27:54,880
up you understand like uh we should be
 

3603
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:56,470
up you understand like uh we should be
able to walk up each corner

3604
01:27:56,470 --> 01:27:56,480
able to walk up each corner
 

3605
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:59,510
able to walk up each corner
from the inside oh from the inside you

3606
01:27:59,510 --> 01:27:59,520
from the inside oh from the inside you
 

3607
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:00,950
from the inside oh from the inside you
want to build it

3608
01:28:00,950 --> 01:28:00,960
want to build it
 

3609
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:04,390
want to build it
then yeah like uh

3610
01:28:04,390 --> 01:28:04,400
then yeah like uh
 

3611
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:06,950
then yeah like uh
oh that makes sense we shouldn't be able

3612
01:28:06,950 --> 01:28:06,960
oh that makes sense we shouldn't be able
 

3613
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:07,750
oh that makes sense we shouldn't be able
to do it like that

3614
01:28:07,750 --> 01:28:07,760
to do it like that
 

3615
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:11,270
to do it like that
i think it is i think that's

3616
01:28:11,270 --> 01:28:11,280
i think it is i think that's
 

3617
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:15,510
i think it is i think that's
but aren't we building

3618
01:28:15,510 --> 01:28:15,520
but aren't we building
 

3619
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:17,910
but aren't we building
unnecessary blocks outside like like

3620
01:28:17,910 --> 01:28:17,920
unnecessary blocks outside like like
 

3621
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:19,830
unnecessary blocks outside like like
like this one because we have to place

3622
01:28:19,830 --> 01:28:19,840
like this one because we have to place
 

3623
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:21,110
like this one because we have to place
something

3624
01:28:21,110 --> 01:28:21,120
something
 

3625
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:23,430
something
underneath every time to build the next

3626
01:28:23,430 --> 01:28:23,440
underneath every time to build the next
 

3627
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:26,170
underneath every time to build the next
step

3628
01:28:26,170 --> 01:28:26,180

 

3629
01:28:26,180 --> 01:28:27,750

[Music]

3630
01:28:27,750 --> 01:28:27,760
[Music]
 

3631
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:29,110
[Music]
we can well that's why we have this

3632
01:28:29,110 --> 01:28:29,120
we can well that's why we have this
 

3633
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:33,510
we can well that's why we have this
platform here so that we can uh

3634
01:28:33,510 --> 01:28:33,520

 

3635
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:35,510

yeah yeah you got the right idea i think

3636
01:28:35,510 --> 01:28:35,520
yeah yeah you got the right idea i think
 

3637
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:40,830
yeah yeah you got the right idea i think
this is yeah okay

3638
01:28:40,830 --> 01:28:40,840

 

3639
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:43,350

yeah but the highest yes

3640
01:28:43,350 --> 01:28:43,360
yeah but the highest yes
 

3641
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:46,470
yeah but the highest yes
we got a problem okay so maybe go on the

3642
01:28:46,470 --> 01:28:46,480
we got a problem okay so maybe go on the
 

3643
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:49,830
we got a problem okay so maybe go on the
other corner and then

3644
01:28:49,830 --> 01:28:49,840

 

3645
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:54,830

understand how i can do the thing
 

3673
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:37,110
understand how i can do the thing
okay we'll go we'll go out by two this

3674
01:29:37,110 --> 01:29:37,120
okay we'll go we'll go out by two this
 

3675
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:42,870
okay we'll go we'll go out by two this
time okay

3676
01:29:42,870 --> 01:29:42,880

 

3677
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:46,149

and just to give it more um i want to

3678

and just to give it more um i want to
 

3679
01:29:46,159 --> 01:29:47,430
and just to give it more um i want to
say girth but i don't think that's the

3680
01:29:47,430 --> 01:29:47,440
say girth but i don't think that's the
 

3681
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:47,830
say girth but i don't think that's the
right

3682
01:29:47,830 --> 01:29:47,840
right
 

3683
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:54,550

it's probably just gonna be like
 

7251
03:17:06,880 --> 03:17:08,309
