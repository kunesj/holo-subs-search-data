1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,820
​​​ ​There's no better street advertising​ ​​
​​ ​than a cute maid.​ ​​

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:06,690
​​​ ​Dog gods are very old in age, right?​ ​​

3
00:00:04,989 --> 00:00:05,089
​​<i>​ ​​​ ​</i>​

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:07,758
​​​ ​That's creepy!​ ​​

5
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:12,830
​​​ ​Kikkeriki!​ ​​

6
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:14,999
​​​ ​Today we have another episode​ ​​

7
00:00:14,999 --> 00:00:18,202
​​​ ​of holo's Bonjour!​ ​​

8
00:00:19,636 --> 00:00:24,441
​​​ ​This is hololive's official​ ​​
​​ ​variety talk show where​ ​​

9
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:29,079
​​​ ​a cast member is swapped out​ ​​
​​ ​at each episode!​ ​​

10
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:31,215
​​​ ​Without further ado,​ ​​

11
00:00:31,215 --> 00:00:33,984
​​​ ​let's introduce today's cast!​ ​​

12
00:00:33,984 --> 00:00:36,186
​​​ ​Of course,​ ​​

13
00:00:36,186 --> 00:00:37,588
​​​ ​there's me, Kiara.​ ​​

14
00:00:37,588 --> 00:00:39,023
​​​ ​Takanashi Kiara here!​ ​​

15
00:00:39,023 --> 00:00:42,393
​​​ ​I'm a member of hololive English -Myth-!​ ​​

16
00:00:42,393 --> 00:00:45,029
​​​ ​I'm what they call a phoenix,​ ​​

17
00:00:45,029 --> 00:00:46,730
​​​ ​but I'm also a manager,​ ​​

18
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,065
​​​ ​or rather a CEO...​ ​​

19
00:00:48,065 --> 00:00:48,866
​​​ ​Wait, hold on.​ ​​

20
00:00:48,866 --> 00:00:50,968
​​​ ​I've been mixing it up!​ ​​

21
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:55,205
​​​ ​I'm a phoenix and CEO,​ ​​
​​ ​but they call me Manager!​ ​​

22
00:00:55,205 --> 00:00:59,143
​​​ ​Our second cast member​ ​​
​​ ​is this lady beside me!​ ​​

23
00:00:59,143 --> 00:01:00,277
​​​ ​Reine!​ ​​

24
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:09,219
​​​ ​Reine here,​ ​​
​​ ​from hololive Indonesia's 2nd Gen!​ ​​

25
00:01:09,219 --> 00:01:10,020
​​​ ​I am a peacock!​ ​​

26
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,188
​​​ ​Peace.​ ​​

27
00:01:14,691 --> 00:01:17,261
​​​ ​Last up is our newcomer!​ ​​

28
00:01:17,261 --> 00:01:19,596
​​​ ​Our third cast member is...​ ​​

29
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:27,838
​​​ ​I'm IRyS,​ ​​
​​ ​hololive English Project: HOPE's VSinger!​ ​​

30
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:28,639
​​​ ​I'm, umm...​ ​​

31
00:01:28,639 --> 00:01:30,808
​​​ ​I'm an angel!​ ​​

32
00:01:30,808 --> 00:01:32,976
​​​ ​Angel?!​ ​​

33
00:01:32,443 --> 00:01:33,777
​​​ ​I am!​ ​​

34
00:01:32,976 --> 00:01:35,145
​​​ ​You're not <i>just </i>an angel, right?​ ​​

35
00:01:35,145 --> 00:01:36,413
​​​ ​Hmm? What was that?​ ​​

36
00:01:36,413 --> 00:01:37,848
​​​ ​That's not right.​ ​​

37
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:37,848
​​​ ​What?​ ​​

38
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,316
​​​ ​What are those horns then?​ ​​

39
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:39,316
​​​ ​My horns?​ ​​

40
00:01:39,316 --> 00:01:40,684
​​​ ​They're angel horns, I'm sure!​ ​​

41
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:41,985
​​​ ​Angels have horns, don't they?​ ​​

42
00:01:41,985 --> 00:01:43,921
​​​ ​And your wings. Where are the wings?​ ​​

43
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:45,456
​​​ ​Where are your angel wings?​ ​​

44
00:01:45,456 --> 00:01:47,724
​​​ ​I have wings! It's just that...​ ​​

45
00:01:47,724 --> 00:01:50,928
​​​ ​I don't have them with me right now.​ ​​

46
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:53,397
​​​ ​They're in her wardrobe.​ ​​

47
00:01:50,928 --> 00:01:53,197
​​​ ​I have wings! I really do!​ ​​

48
00:01:50,928 --> 00:01:53,397
​​​ ​You sure 'bout that? Hmm?​ ​​

49
00:01:52,496 --> 00:01:53,397
​​​ ​Sure, sure.​ ​​

50
00:01:53,397 --> 00:01:55,466
​​​ ​Okay, fine. I was lying!​ ​​

51
00:01:55,466 --> 00:01:57,101
​​​ ​I'm half-angel and half-demon!​ ​​

52
00:01:57,101 --> 00:01:59,336
​​​ ​Thanks for having me here!​ ​​

53
00:01:57,634 --> 00:01:59,336
​​​ ​Thanks for coming.​ ​​

54
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:00,604
​​​ ​That's all!​ ​​

55
00:02:00,604 --> 00:02:04,508
​​​ ​Today's show will be​ ​​
​​ ​presented by the three of us!​ ​​

56
00:02:04,508 --> 00:02:07,077
​​​ ​I, Takanashi Kiara,​ ​​

57
00:02:07,077 --> 00:02:09,613
​​​ ​will be today's MC!​ ​​

58
00:02:12,015 --> 00:02:13,817
​​​ ​Sounds like she's fit for the job!​ ​​

59
00:02:15,586 --> 00:02:19,723
​​​ ​By the way, did you girls notice?​ ​​

60
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:23,760
​​​ ​There are no Japanese​ ​​
​​ ​members left among us!​ ​​

61
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,095
​​​ ​How did that happen?​ ​​

62
00:02:25,095 --> 00:02:30,134
​​​ ​The official Japanese channel​ ​​
​​ ​is ours for the taking!​ ​​

63
00:02:31,635 --> 00:02:35,038
​​​ ​Now is our time to shine!​ ​​

64
00:02:33,937 --> 00:02:35,038
​​​ ​Heck yeah!​ ​​

65
00:02:35,272 --> 00:02:36,640
​​​ ​Gottem.​ ​​

66
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,510
​​​ ​It's not like there were​ ​​
​​ ​no Japanese members​ ​​

67
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,645
​​​ ​available to join the show today,​ ​​

68
00:02:41,645 --> 00:02:43,947
​​​ ​but when the staff asked me​ ​​

69
00:02:43,947 --> 00:02:46,450
​​​ ​who I wanted next on the show,​ ​​

70
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,985
​​​ ​I said "Reine."​ ​​

71
00:02:47,985 --> 00:02:49,520
​​​ ​And if I remember right, Reine-chan,​ ​​

72
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,854
​​​ ​you wanted IRyS, yeah?​ ​​

73
00:02:51,889 --> 00:02:53,090
​​​ ​You did, right?​ ​​

74
00:02:52,356 --> 00:02:53,891
​​​ ​I think so?​ ​​

75
00:02:53,891 --> 00:02:55,759
​​​ ​You <i>think </i>so? You're not even sure?​ ​​

76
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:56,960
​​​ ​I think I did!​ ​​

77
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,960
​​​ ​You <i>think</i>?​ ​​

78
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,831
​​​ ​Why am I even here, then?​ ​​

79
00:02:58,862 --> 00:03:00,831
​​​ ​Very good question.​ ​​

80
00:03:00,831 --> 00:03:02,266
​​​ ​Who invited you?​ ​​

81
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:03,934
​​​ ​Who the heck called me here?​ ​​

82
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:08,605
​​​ ​So now that we've figured all of that out,​ ​​

83
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:13,010
​​​ ​let's kick things off​ ​​
​​ ​with our usual first segment!​ ​​

84
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:17,581
​​​ ​Random Rapid-Fire Interrogation!​ ​​

85
00:03:21,718 --> 00:03:23,921
​​​ ​Today's first segment is​ ​​

86
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:26,190
​​​ ​Random Rapid-Fire Interrogation.​ ​​

87
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,492
​​​ ​In this segment, the two of us long-timers​ ​​

88
00:03:28,492 --> 00:03:31,094
​​​ ​will be pelting the newcomer IRyS​ ​​

89
00:03:31,094 --> 00:03:32,930
​​​ ​with a― ohoho―​ ​​

90
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:36,800
​​​ ​barrage of random questions!​ ​​

91
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,468
​​​ ​That's how this works.​ ​​

92
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:41,305
​​​ ​Are you ready for this, IRyS-chan?​ ​​

93
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:44,708
​​​ ​I-I'll do my best!​ ​​

94
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:45,809
​​​ ​You go girl!​ ​​

95
00:03:45,075 --> 00:03:46,910
​​​ ​I'll try!​ ​​

96
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:46,910
​​​ ​Go for it.​ ​​

97
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,545
​​​ ​Let us begin.​ ​​

98
00:03:48,545 --> 00:03:50,881
​​​ ​Twenty question assault...​ ​​

99
00:03:50,881 --> 00:03:51,415
​​​ ​Assault...​ ​​

100
00:03:51,415 --> 00:03:53,517
​​​ ​Starts now!​ ​​

101
00:03:54,451 --> 00:03:57,321
​​​ ​Which song of yours is your favorite?​ ​​

102
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:58,755
​​<i>​ ​Gravity</i>!​ ​​

103
00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:03,393
​​​ ​What's your favorite holoEN song​ ​​
​​ ​that isn't your own?​ ​​

104
00:04:03,393 --> 00:04:04,995
​​​ ​It's <i>DO U</i>!​ ​​

105
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:06,263
​​​ ​NO WAY! SERIOUSLY?!​ ​​

106
00:04:06,263 --> 00:04:08,398
​​​ ​It has to be <i>DO U</i>!​ ​​

107
00:04:07,264 --> 00:04:08,398
​​​ ​Thanks!​ ​​

108
00:04:08,398 --> 00:04:10,334
​​​ ​Tell us a secret!​ ​​

109
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:11,735
​​​ ​Oh, umm...​ ​​

110
00:04:11,735 --> 00:04:14,004
​​​ ​A secret... A secret...​ ​​

111
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:17,741
​​​ ​I bought a PS4 for Christmas,​ ​​

112
00:04:17,741 --> 00:04:20,410
​​​ ​but I haven't touched it at all so far!​ ​​

113
00:04:23,413 --> 00:04:25,782
​​​ ​Who's the scariest senpai?​ ​​

114
00:04:28,652 --> 00:04:31,521
​​​ ​C-C-Calli-senpai!​ ​​

115
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:35,525
​​​ ​You get along quite well, though!​ ​​

116
00:04:36,727 --> 00:04:39,062
​​​ ​And who's the nicest senpai?​ ​​

117
00:04:39,062 --> 00:04:40,998
​​​ ​Watame-senpai!​ ​​

118
00:04:40,998 --> 00:04:43,300
​​​ ​Oh, I get you there.​ ​​

119
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,669
​​​ ​What activity would you like to do with me?​ ​​

120
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,405
​​​ ​A keyboard review!​ ​​

121
00:04:50,907 --> 00:04:52,376
​​​ ​Let's try out some keyboards!​ ​​

122
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:53,410
​​​ ​And for the last one...​ ​​

123
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:55,846
​​​ ​Say a line in your most handsome voice!​ ​​

124
00:04:55,846 --> 00:04:56,780
​​​ ​Handsome voice...​ ​​

125
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:00,117
​​​ ​I want your everything.​ ​​

126
00:05:03,153 --> 00:05:03,954
​​​ ​I tried.​ ​​

127
00:05:03,954 --> 00:05:06,023
​​​ ​I tried. Yep. I tried.​ ​​

128
00:05:06,023 --> 00:05:09,226
​​​ ​That's a wrap!​ ​​

129
00:05:07,591 --> 00:05:09,226
​​​ ​A wrap!​ ​​

130
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:10,093
​​​ ​So, uhh...​ ​​

131
00:05:10,093 --> 00:05:12,763
​​​ ​You mentioned that Calli-chan​ ​​
​​ ​was the scariest senpai,​ ​​

132
00:05:12,763 --> 00:05:15,132
​​​ ​but you get along just fine.​ ​​

133
00:05:15,132 --> 00:05:17,200
​​​ ​Was she scary to you at first?​ ​​

134
00:05:17,868 --> 00:05:19,736
​​​ ​No, it's not like that.​ ​​

135
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,973
​​​ ​It's not that she was scary at first,​ ​​

136
00:05:22,973 --> 00:05:26,410
​​​ ​but more like... She's a reaper, right?​ ​​

137
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,010
​​​ ​Yep.​ ​​

138
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:30,947
​​​ ​And if you make the grim reaper angry,​ ​​
​​ ​you know you're in for...​ ​​

139
00:05:30,947 --> 00:05:32,149
​​​ ​Well...​ ​​

140
00:05:32,149 --> 00:05:33,050
​​​ ​Y'know...​ ​​

141
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:36,753
​​​ ​You'd be really cautious at first, right?​ ​​

142
00:05:37,688 --> 00:05:40,390
​​​ ​She ended up being​ ​​
​​ ​the nicest one in the end though.​ ​​

143
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:43,560
​​​ ​She's really nice,​ ​​
​​ ​and we work really well together.​ ​​

144
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:45,062
​​​ ​Calli-chan's the type to​ ​​

145
00:05:45,062 --> 00:05:48,598
​​​ ​never get mad at other holo members.​ ​​

146
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:48,131
​​​ ​Right?!​ ​​

147
00:05:48,131 --> 00:05:50,334
​​​ ​She's not the type to get mad at all!​ ​​

148
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,334
​​​ ​She never would.​ ​​

149
00:05:50,334 --> 00:05:51,702
​​​ ​Looking back a bit,​ ​​

150
00:05:51,702 --> 00:05:53,370
​​​ ​my first impression of her was,​ ​​

151
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,605
​​​ ​"Oh, she's a rapper.​ ​​

152
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,407
​​​ ​She might go full rapper​ ​​

153
00:05:57,407 --> 00:06:01,345
​​​ ​and shred me to bits​ ​​
​​ ​with some heavy bars."​ ​​

154
00:06:01,345 --> 00:06:03,747
​​​ ​Intimidating, isn't she?​ ​​

155
00:06:02,646 --> 00:06:04,815
​​​ ​Yes.​ ​​

156
00:06:03,747 --> 00:06:04,815
​​​ ​Understandable.​ ​​

157
00:06:04,815 --> 00:06:06,783
​​​ ​But later on, I ended up​ ​​

158
00:06:04,815 --> 00:06:05,982
​​​ ​I get ya.​ ​​

159
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,252
​​​ ​getting along just fine with her.​ ​​

160
00:06:09,252 --> 00:06:11,154
​​​ ​Did anything catch your eye, Reine-chan?​ ​​

161
00:06:11,154 --> 00:06:13,056
​​​ ​Oh, right!​ ​​

162
00:06:13,056 --> 00:06:15,525
​​​ ​So about your secret, IRyS.​ ​​

163
00:06:15,525 --> 00:06:18,228
​​​ ​About that PS4...​ ​​

164
00:06:18,228 --> 00:06:20,897
​​​ ​Do you have plans​ ​​
​​ ​to use it any time soon?​ ​​

165
00:06:21,832 --> 00:06:24,935
​​​ ​I do! Someday!​ ​​

166
00:06:24,935 --> 00:06:28,171
​​​ ​I've been thinking of playing​ ​​
​​ ​a <i>Yakuza </i>game.​ ​​

167
00:06:28,171 --> 00:06:30,040
​​​ ​That's actually why I bought a PS4,​ ​​

168
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,944
​​​ ​although I really wanted a PS5.​ ​​

169
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,944
​​​ ​I think it's worth it.​ ​​

170
00:06:33,944 --> 00:06:36,146
​​​ ​Once I bought it, though,​ ​​

171
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:40,083
​​​ ​I started thinking that I'd have no space​ ​​
​​ ​for it once I took it out of the box.​ ​​

172
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:43,587
​​​ ​And setting everything up​ ​​
​​ ​seemed like a pain.​ ​​

173
00:06:43,587 --> 00:06:44,688
​​​ ​Hey!​ ​​

174
00:06:43,587 --> 00:06:46,056
​​​ ​So it's been stuck in the box ever since.​ ​​

175
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:47,023
​​​ ​You already bought it!​ ​​

176
00:06:47,023 --> 00:06:49,793
​​​ ​Just go play <i>Yakuza </i>on it already!​ ​​

177
00:06:49,226 --> 00:06:51,795
​​​ ​Oh, but okay― So you see...​ ​​

178
00:06:51,795 --> 00:06:54,498
​​​ ​I've wanted the PS4 controller​ ​​
​​ ​for a while now,​ ​​

179
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:57,434
​​​ ​so I've at least opened the box for that one.​ ​​

180
00:06:57,434 --> 00:06:59,069
​​​ ​Agh...​ ​​

181
00:06:57,434 --> 00:06:59,069
​​​ ​It has seen some use, yes.​ ​​

182
00:06:59,302 --> 00:07:02,606
​​​ ​It's time for the next segment!​ ​​

183
00:07:02,606 --> 00:07:06,977
​​​ ​KFP's Road to Greatness!​ ​​

184
00:07:06,977 --> 00:07:10,547
​​​ ​Woo-hoo!​ ​​

185
00:07:07,544 --> 00:07:09,112
​​​ ​This is...​ ​​

186
00:07:07,811 --> 00:07:10,914
​​​ ​Woo-hoo!​ ​​

187
00:07:09,112 --> 00:07:12,082
​​​ ​Thank you, that's very kind.​ ​​

188
00:07:13,316 --> 00:07:15,318
​​​ ​This is my segment!​ ​​

189
00:07:15,318 --> 00:07:20,424
​​​ ​You see, I've been looking for​ ​​
​​ ​a manager for the Japan branch,​ ​​

190
00:07:20,424 --> 00:07:22,192
​​​ ​and I <i>still </i>haven't found one!​ ​​

191
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:26,563
​​​ ​None of the applicants were qualified.​ ​​

192
00:07:26,062 --> 00:07:26,563
​​​ ​Oh no!​ ​​

193
00:07:26,563 --> 00:07:28,965
​​​ ​But wait, we're not JP members.​ ​​

194
00:07:28,965 --> 00:07:31,735
​​​ ​Are we still applying to be​ ​​
​​ ​the Japanese branch manager?​ ​​

195
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:31,168
​​​ ​Oh...​ ​​

196
00:07:31,735 --> 00:07:33,537
​​​ ​Well, IRyS does...​ ​​

197
00:07:31,735 --> 00:07:33,537
​​​ ​How about the Indonesian branch?​ ​​

198
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:36,706
​​​ ​IRyS does live in Japan, right?​ ​​

199
00:07:35,238 --> 00:07:37,474
​​​ ​That's true.​ ​​

200
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,041
​​​ ​So, yeah...​ ​​

201
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:41,978
​​​ ​You two will have to take a test given by me​ ​​

202
00:07:41,978 --> 00:07:44,448
​​​ ​to see if you're fit for the job.​ ​​

203
00:07:44,448 --> 00:07:46,016
​​​ ​If you pass the test,​ ​​

204
00:07:46,016 --> 00:07:49,019
​​​ ​you get to be manager!​ ​​

205
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:49,753
​​​ ​So...​ ​​

206
00:07:49,753 --> 00:07:50,687
​​​ ​Ooh...​ ​​

207
00:07:49,753 --> 00:07:51,621
​​​ ​good luck, you two!​ ​​

208
00:07:51,121 --> 00:07:53,256
​​​ ​Yeah, I'll do my best!​ ​​

209
00:07:51,621 --> 00:07:53,256
​​​ ​Okay!​ ​​

210
00:07:53,256 --> 00:07:56,359
​​​ ​That manager position is mine!​ ​​

211
00:07:55,325 --> 00:07:56,359
​​​ ​It just might be!​ ​​

212
00:07:56,359 --> 00:07:57,127
​​​ ​It might!​ ​​

213
00:07:57,127 --> 00:07:58,595
​​​ ​First up is this!​ ​​

214
00:07:58,595 --> 00:07:59,663
​​​ ​Ta-dah!​ ​​

215
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,932
​​​ ​Manager qualification #1:​ ​​

216
00:08:01,932 --> 00:08:04,634
​​​ ​Proper assignment of staff!​ ​​

217
00:08:04,634 --> 00:08:06,336
​​​ ​Woo-hoo!​ ​​

218
00:08:04,634 --> 00:08:08,805
​​​ ​Yay!​ ​​

219
00:08:04,634 --> 00:08:08,805
​​​ ​Woo!​ ​​

220
00:08:06,336 --> 00:08:08,805
​​​ ​Yeah!​ ​​

221
00:08:08,805 --> 00:08:11,842
​​​ ​A manager needs to have​ ​​

222
00:08:11,842 --> 00:08:14,177
​​​ ​the skill to figure out what task​ ​​

223
00:08:14,177 --> 00:08:17,147
​​​ ​each staff member is best suited to.​ ​​

224
00:08:17,147 --> 00:08:21,451
​​​ ​So let's see if you two have that skill.​ ​​

225
00:08:21,451 --> 00:08:26,156
​​​ ​You will be shown pictures​ ​​
​​ ​of four holo members.​ ​​

226
00:08:26,156 --> 00:08:36,433
​​​ ​You'll have to assign them to one of four jobs:​ ​​
​​ ​the counter, kitchen, advertising, or delivery.​ ​​

227
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:39,636
​​​ ​If your assignments are the same as mine,​ ​​

228
00:08:39,636 --> 00:08:42,272
​​​ ​then you're fit for the manager role!​ ​​

229
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:46,877
​​​ ​The holo members applying​ ​​
​​ ​for part-time jobs this time are...​ ​​

230
00:08:46,877 --> 00:08:48,011
​​​ ​these four!​ ​​

231
00:08:48,011 --> 00:08:49,446
​​​ ​Ta-dah!​ ​​

232
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:52,916
​​​ ​Counter​ ​​
​​ ​Kitchen​ ​​
​​ ​Advertising​ ​​
​​ ​Delivery​ ​​

233
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:52,916
​​​ ​Minato Aqua​ ​​

234
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:52,916
​​​ ​Sakura Miko​ ​​

235
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:52,916
​​​ ​Inugami Korone​ ​​

236
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:52,916
​​​ ​Shirogane Noel​ ​​

237
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:57,254
​​​ ​Please assign these four​ ​​
​​ ​to their most appropriate jobs!​ ​​

238
00:08:57,254 --> 00:09:01,358
​​​ ​Your thinking time starts now!​ ​​

239
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:00,557
​​​ ​What?!​ ​​

240
00:09:01,358 --> 00:09:02,192
​​​ ​Go!​ ​​

241
00:09:02,192 --> 00:09:05,128
​​​ ​There are perfect matches for them!​ ​​

242
00:09:03,827 --> 00:09:06,429
​​​ ​Uh, counter...​ ​​

243
00:09:04,861 --> 00:09:06,429
​​​ ​Are there?​ ​​

244
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:06,963
​​​ ​For all of them!​ ​​

245
00:09:06,429 --> 00:09:07,497
​​​ ​Um...​ ​​

246
00:09:07,898 --> 00:09:09,266
​​​ ​...two...​ ​​

247
00:09:09,266 --> 00:09:10,500
​​​ ​one!​ ​​

248
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:12,068
​​​ ​I'm not so sure about​ ​​
​​ ​my answers, to be honest.​ ​​

249
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:14,437
​​​ ​Ding-ding-ding!​ ​​

250
00:09:12,435 --> 00:09:13,803
​​​ ​Me neither.​ ​​

251
00:09:14,838 --> 00:09:17,207
​​​ ​So much pressure!​ ​​

252
00:09:15,605 --> 00:09:18,842
​​​ ​Thinking time over!​ ​​

253
00:09:17,207 --> 00:09:18,842
​​​ ​Very, very...​ ​​

254
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:18,842
​​​ ​I know.​ ​​

255
00:09:18,842 --> 00:09:19,809
​​​ ​So much pressure.​ ​​

256
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:23,647
​​​ ​Now, let's take a look at your answers!​ ​​

257
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:26,316
​​​ ​Here's how they answered!​ ​​

258
00:09:27,951 --> 00:09:29,519
​​​ ​Ah, I see.​ ​​

259
00:09:30,387 --> 00:09:32,455
​​​ ​I had no idea!​ ​​

260
00:09:30,787 --> 00:09:32,455
​​​ ​I can tell you struggled.​ ​​

261
00:09:33,023 --> 00:09:34,758
​​​ ​Then first...​ ​​

262
00:09:34,758 --> 00:09:37,794
​​​ ​let's hear Reine-chan's​ ​​
​​ ​answers and reasoning—​ ​​

263
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,794
​​​ ​Hang on!​ ​​

264
00:09:37,794 --> 00:09:41,064
​​​ ​Wait, can we start with IRyS?​ ​​

265
00:09:40,096 --> 00:09:41,932
​​​ ​Wait, me first?​ ​​

266
00:09:41,932 --> 00:09:43,166
​​​ ​Well...​ ​​

267
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:46,870
​​​ ​running the counter​ ​​
​​ ​seemed easiest, you know?​ ​​

268
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,306
​​​ ​You chose it because it was easiest?​ ​​

269
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,639
​​​ ​It seemed easiest, so...​ ​​

270
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:51,107
​​​ ​Well, you know.​ ​​

271
00:09:51,107 --> 00:09:53,276
​​​ ​She's a baby, Miko-senpai.​ ​​

272
00:09:51,107 --> 00:09:53,276
​​​ ​Head of the holo babies​ ​​

273
00:09:53,276 --> 00:09:54,711
​​​ ​Good point.​ ​​

274
00:09:53,276 --> 00:09:55,545
​​​ ​Miko-senpai's just a baby.​ ​​

275
00:09:55,545 --> 00:10:01,017
​​​ ​And the advertising job​ ​​
​​ ​would go to our poster girl,​ ​​

276
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,320
​​​ ​Aqua-senpai. Since she's a maid.​ ​​

277
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,156
​​​ ​There's no better street advertising​ ​​
​​ ​than a cute maid.​ ​​

278
00:10:06,156 --> 00:10:10,360
​​​ ​Yes, your reasoning is not bad.​ ​​

279
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,696
​​​ ​I had my reasons.​ ​​

280
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,696
​​​ ​I'd like to hear Reine-chan...​ ​​

281
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:15,999
​​​ ​Let's hear Reine-chan's reasoning.​ ​​

282
00:10:15,999 --> 00:10:19,903
​​​ ​The counter goes to Noel-senpai​ ​​

283
00:10:19,903 --> 00:10:22,872
​​​ ​because she has strong muscles.​ ​​

284
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,908
​​​ ​Everyone who goes up to the counter,​ ​​

285
00:10:24,908 --> 00:10:28,144
​​​ ​would be like, "Oh my god, muscle!​ ​​
​​ ​How very strong you are!"​ ​​

286
00:10:25,075 --> 00:10:30,513
​​​ ​Customer​ ​​

287
00:10:28,979 --> 00:10:30,513
​​​ ​Would they?!​ ​​

288
00:10:29,145 --> 00:10:32,415
​​​ ​"Th-This restaurant must be..."​ ​​

289
00:10:30,914 --> 00:10:34,117
​​​ ​Does... Does that have anything​ ​​
​​ ​to do with being at the counter?!​ ​​

290
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,319
​​​ ​Yeah, I don't think muscles are relevant there!​ ​​

291
00:10:34,117 --> 00:10:36,319
​​​ ​Yes, they are!​ ​​

292
00:10:36,319 --> 00:10:40,423
​​​ ​You mean customers who want​ ​​
​​ ​to build muscle might visit?​ ​​

293
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:40,423
​​​ ​Yes, exactly!​ ​​

294
00:10:40,423 --> 00:10:42,559
​​​ ​And Korone-senpai for delivery.​ ​​

295
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,728
​​​ ​Because she's a dog god.​ ​​

296
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:46,830
​​​ ​So if...​ ​​

297
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:47,964
​​​ ​Yes?​ ​​

298
00:10:47,964 --> 00:10:52,802
​​​ ​Dog gods are very old in age, right?​ ​​

299
00:10:52,802 --> 00:10:54,537
​​​ ​What are you talking about?!​ ​​

300
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,271
​​​ ​Huh?​ ​​

301
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,271
​​​ ​Their age is—​ ​​

302
00:10:55,271 --> 00:10:57,574
​​​ ​You're bringing up her age?!​ ​​

303
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:59,509
​​​ ​I dunno about Japan,​ ​​

304
00:10:59,509 --> 00:11:02,345
​​​ ​but in places like Indonesia,​ ​​

305
00:11:02,345 --> 00:11:05,448
​​​ ​you cannot rely on GPS at all.​ ​​

306
00:11:05,448 --> 00:11:06,483
​​​ ​I see.​ ​​

307
00:11:05,448 --> 00:11:06,483
​​​ ​Right.​ ​​

308
00:11:06,483 --> 00:11:08,652
​​​ ​So when there's a problem with that,​ ​​

309
00:11:08,652 --> 00:11:10,654
​​​ ​I think Korone-senpai could figure it out.​ ​​

310
00:11:10,654 --> 00:11:14,858
​​​ ​Since she has lots of​ ​​
​​ ​"walking-walking" experience in life.​ ​​

311
00:11:14,858 --> 00:11:16,826
​​​ ​I see.​ ​​

312
00:11:14,858 --> 00:11:16,226
​​​ ​She's got lots of that.​ ​​

313
00:11:15,358 --> 00:11:17,360
​​​ ​I see.​ ​​

314
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,729
​​​ ​Okay, I get what you mean.​ ​​

315
00:11:19,729 --> 00:11:23,400
​​​ ​Now, let's see what my answers were!​ ​​

316
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,467
​​​ ​Okay!​ ​​

317
00:11:26,236 --> 00:11:27,504
​​​ ​Here they are!​ ​​

318
00:11:27,504 --> 00:11:29,939
​​​ ​Look! I got 3 and 4!​ ​​

319
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,939
​​​ ​Reine-chan!​ ​​

320
00:11:28,171 --> 00:11:29,939
​​​ ​Mine are all wrong!​ ​​

321
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:30,874
​​​ ​Hang on!​ ​​

322
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,242
​​​ ​You got two!​ ​​

323
00:11:32,242 --> 00:11:34,110
​​​ ​Reine-chan, you got two right! Nice job!​ ​​

324
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,145
​​​ ​And next,​ ​​

325
00:11:35,145 --> 00:11:37,981
​​​ ​I assigned Noel-senpai to the kitchen​ ​​

326
00:11:37,981 --> 00:11:41,418
​​​ ​because she's got big "mom" energy.​ ​​

327
00:11:41,418 --> 00:11:43,186
​​​ ​With such "mom" energy,​ ​​

328
00:11:43,186 --> 00:11:47,924
​​​ ​I thought, she <i>must </i>be good at cooking.​ ​​

329
00:11:47,924 --> 00:11:51,294
​​​ ​I chose Korone-senpai for delivery​ ​​

330
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:54,297
​​​ ​because she seems like she'd be fast.​ ​​

331
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:57,734
​​​ ​That's true, she seems athletic.​ ​​

332
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:57,734
​​​ ​Yes, exactly!​ ​​

333
00:11:57,734 --> 00:12:01,738
​​​ ​Plus, if she gets lost along the way,​ ​​

334
00:12:01,738 --> 00:12:03,106
​​​ ​she's a dog,​ ​​

335
00:12:03,106 --> 00:12:05,375
​​​ ​so she can go sniff-sniff​ ​​

336
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:08,912
​​​ ​and find where she needs to go.​ ​​

337
00:12:06,076 --> 00:12:07,477
​​​ ​Yeah, of course.​ ​​

338
00:12:08,912 --> 00:12:11,981
​​​ ​Reine-chan, you got half! That's amazing!​ ​​

339
00:12:11,614 --> 00:12:13,016
​​​ ​Good job!​ ​​

340
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,016
​​​ ​Wow!​ ​​

341
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,217
​​​ ​Yay!​ ​​

342
00:12:14,217 --> 00:12:16,152
​​​ ​I didn't get a single one!​ ​​

343
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,954
​​​ ​Well...​ ​​

344
00:12:17,954 --> 00:12:23,393
​​​ ​You'll get one more chance in​ ​​
​​ ​the next game, which is about memory!​ ​​

345
00:12:23,393 --> 00:12:25,662
​​​ ​And the next qualification is...​ ​​

346
00:12:23,727 --> 00:12:25,662
​​​ ​Memory?​ ​​

347
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,197
​​​ ​this!​ ​​

348
00:12:27,197 --> 00:12:28,665
​​​ ​Manager qualification #2:​ ​​

349
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,734
​​​ ​Memory!​ ​​

350
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,235
​​​ ​Ooh!​ ​​

351
00:12:30,734 --> 00:12:32,235
​​​ ​Wow!​ ​​

352
00:12:30,934 --> 00:12:33,203
​​​ ​Whoa!​ ​​

353
00:12:32,235 --> 00:12:35,171
​​​ ​I am <i>very </i>confident about this!​ ​​

354
00:12:34,604 --> 00:12:36,806
​​​ ​Wow! Really?​ ​​

355
00:12:34,604 --> 00:12:35,872
​​​ ​Really?​ ​​

356
00:12:35,872 --> 00:12:36,806
​​​ ​Yeah!​ ​​

357
00:12:36,806 --> 00:12:39,109
​​​ ​My memory's really good, totally!​ ​​

358
00:12:37,407 --> 00:12:38,408
​​​ ​Well...​ ​​

359
00:12:39,109 --> 00:12:42,212
​​​ ​Reine-chan's memory isn't that good,​ ​​

360
00:12:42,212 --> 00:12:43,913
​​​ ​so I'll go with you, IRyS-chan.​ ​​

361
00:12:42,212 --> 00:12:43,113
​​​ ​Huh?​ ​​

362
00:12:43,913 --> 00:12:44,848
​​​ ​What?!​ ​​

363
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:46,616
​​​ ​Huh? Oh, really?​ ​​

364
00:12:46,616 --> 00:12:49,652
​​​ ​Yeah, but I got a perfect score​ ​​
​​ ​on this test last time.​ ​​

365
00:12:49,652 --> 00:12:50,620
​​​ ​Well, yeah...​ ​​

366
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,490
​​​ ​This challenge is too easy.​ ​​

367
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:55,492
​​​ ​I don't think Reine-chan...​ ​​

368
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:55,492
​​​ ​It's easy, huh?​ ​​

369
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,492
​​​ ​In that case,​ ​​

370
00:12:55,492 --> 00:12:58,928
​​​ ​why don't you participate too,​ ​​
​​ ​this time, Kiara?​ ​​

371
00:12:55,492 --> 00:12:57,293
​​​ ​So it's easy.​ ​​

372
00:12:58,928 --> 00:13:01,498
​​​ ​Right, if it's so easy.​ ​​

373
00:13:00,063 --> 00:13:01,498
​​​ ​It's easy, right?​ ​​

374
00:13:01,498 --> 00:13:02,632
​​​ ​C'mon!​ ​​

375
00:13:02,632 --> 00:13:04,033
​​​ ​I wasn't prepared for this!​ ​​

376
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,401
​​​ ​Well...​ ​​

377
00:13:06,302 --> 00:13:07,137
​​​ ​All right.​ ​​

378
00:13:07,137 --> 00:13:10,173
​​​ ​As a KFP employee,​ ​​
​​ ​you gotta remember the menu​ ​​

379
00:13:10,173 --> 00:13:12,308
​​​ ​and the customers' orders.​ ​​

380
00:13:12,308 --> 00:13:14,611
​​​ ​So a good memory is essential!​ ​​

381
00:13:14,611 --> 00:13:16,079
​​​ ​So for your next task,​ ​​

382
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,282
​​​ ​you will be shown a short clip of a hamburger.​ ​​

383
00:13:19,282 --> 00:13:21,551
​​​ ​You'll have to memorize the order​ ​​

384
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:24,587
​​​ ​of the ingredients in the hamburger,​ ​​

385
00:13:24,587 --> 00:13:29,492
​​​ ​but you have only ten seconds​ ​​
​​ ​to save it to your memory!​ ​​

386
00:13:29,492 --> 00:13:31,227
​​​ ​Here we go!​ ​​

387
00:13:29,492 --> 00:13:31,227
​​​ ​Limiter off!​ ​​

388
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,996
​​​ ​Here's the burger!​ ​​

389
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,295
​​​ ​Okay...​ ​​

390
00:13:32,996 --> 00:13:34,898
​​​ ​Ten seconds starts now.​ ​​

391
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:36,232
​​​ ​Wait, a sandwich?​ ​​

392
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:35,999
​​​ ​Huh?​ ​​

393
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,334
​​​ ​Wait, what?!​ ​​

394
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:41,771
​​​ ​Uhh...​ ​​

395
00:13:41,771 --> 00:13:42,705
​​​ ​Oh god.​ ​​

396
00:13:45,308 --> 00:13:46,176
​​​ ​Okay!​ ​​

397
00:13:46,176 --> 00:13:50,613
​​​ ​Write your answers in your spaces.​ ​​

398
00:13:50,613 --> 00:13:51,614
​​​ ​Hmm?​ ​​

399
00:13:51,014 --> 00:13:52,015
​​​ ​Uh, oopsie...​ ​​

400
00:13:51,614 --> 00:13:53,116
​​​ ​Wait, hang on...​ ​​

401
00:13:53,683 --> 00:13:56,886
​​​ ​How are you feeling? To be honest...​ ​​

402
00:13:56,886 --> 00:13:58,855
​​​ ​I'm not that confident myself.​ ​​

403
00:13:58,855 --> 00:14:00,089
​​​ ​Yeah.​ ​​

404
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:03,459
​​​ ​But you're the boss! You'll be fine.​ ​​

405
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:05,461
​​​ ​Well, let's take a look at our answers!​ ​​

406
00:14:05,461 --> 00:14:06,629
​​​ ​Ta-dah!​ ​​

407
00:14:05,461 --> 00:14:06,930
​​​ ​Okay!​ ​​

408
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,199
​​​ ​Huh? We don't quite agree.​ ​​

409
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,567
​​​ ​Huh? Hang on...​ ​​

410
00:14:10,567 --> 00:14:12,368
​​​ ​Wait, our answers are all...​ ​​

411
00:14:12,368 --> 00:14:14,003
​​​ ​We agree on the bread.​ ​​

412
00:14:14,003 --> 00:14:15,605
​​​ ​Well yeah, of course!​ ​​

413
00:14:14,003 --> 00:14:16,372
​​​ ​And the lettuce, too.​ ​​

414
00:14:16,372 --> 00:14:20,577
​​​ ​But then, it's ketchup, cheese, cheese,​ ​​
​​ ​for some reason.​ ​​

415
00:14:20,577 --> 00:14:22,879
​​​ ​Then cheese, sauce...​ ​​

416
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:24,581
​​​ ​Wait, what's that question mark?​ ​​

417
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:24,581
​​​ ​and question mark.​ ​​

418
00:14:24,581 --> 00:14:26,349
​​​ ​What's with the question mark?​ ​​

419
00:14:26,349 --> 00:14:30,720
​​​ ​Well of course, it represents ketchup!​ ​​

420
00:14:29,686 --> 00:14:31,287
​​​ ​What?!​ ​​

421
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:31,821
​​​ ​That's ketchup, right?​ ​​

422
00:14:31,821 --> 00:14:33,323
​​​ ​Oh, of course!​ ​​

423
00:14:33,323 --> 00:14:35,558
​​​ ​Let's check our answers!​ ​​

424
00:14:36,192 --> 00:14:38,027
​​​ ​I'm really not sure...​ ​​

425
00:14:38,027 --> 00:14:40,129
​​​ ​Ah, I messed up!​ ​​

426
00:14:38,027 --> 00:14:39,195
​​​ ​Ta-dah!​ ​​

427
00:14:39,195 --> 00:14:42,632
​​​ ​Ta-dahhh!​ ​​

428
00:14:42,165 --> 00:14:43,800
​​​ ​That means—​ ​​

429
00:14:42,699 --> 00:14:43,800
​​​ ​I also...​ ​​

430
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,101
​​​ ​Reine got it right, right?​ ​​

431
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,101
​​​ ​I also got it correct!​ ​​

432
00:14:45,101 --> 00:14:48,004
​​​ ​Mine's right too! 'Cause I'm the CEO!​ ​​

433
00:14:45,101 --> 00:14:46,369
​​​ ​Yeah!​ ​​

434
00:14:46,369 --> 00:14:48,671
​​​ ​Hang on, you had a question mark!​ ​​

435
00:14:48,004 --> 00:14:49,339
​​​ ​Huh?​ ​​

436
00:14:48,671 --> 00:14:50,840
​​​ ​A question mark doesn't count!​ ​​

437
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:50,840
​​​ ​Huh?​ ​​

438
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,109
​​​ ​No, see, the question mark​ ​​
​​ ​was ketchup-shaped.​ ​​

439
00:14:53,109 --> 00:14:54,477
​​​ ​It wasn't a question mark.​ ​​

440
00:14:53,543 --> 00:14:55,178
​​​ ​Yes, exactly! Thank you!​ ​​

441
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:55,178
​​​ ​What?!​ ​​

442
00:14:55,178 --> 00:14:58,381
​​​ ​Way to back me up, Reine-chan!​ ​​

443
00:14:55,178 --> 00:14:58,381
​​​ ​That's totally just a question mark!​ ​​

444
00:14:55,411 --> 00:15:01,851
​​​ ​PRESS X TO DOUBT​ ​​

445
00:14:58,381 --> 00:15:00,250
​​​ ​It represents the ketchup sauce.​ ​​

446
00:14:59,782 --> 00:15:01,851
​​​ ​That's cheating!​ ​​

447
00:15:01,851 --> 00:15:03,186
​​​ ​Okay, thank you.​ ​​

448
00:15:03,186 --> 00:15:05,221
​​​ ​I know you got my back, Reine-chan.​ ​​

449
00:15:04,287 --> 00:15:05,221
​​​ ​Not so fast!​ ​​

450
00:15:05,221 --> 00:15:07,490
​​​ ​Not so fast! I object!​ ​​

451
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:10,793
​​​ ​I am <i>not </i>going to be the​ ​​
​​ ​only one who got it wrong!​ ​​

452
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:13,930
​​​ ​It's time for our next segment!​ ​​

453
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:18,268
​​​ ​Romantic Laboratory!​ ​​

454
00:15:18,268 --> 00:15:20,837
​​​ ​This segment is brought to you by Reine-chan!​ ​​

455
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:22,305
​​​ ​I'll hand it off to you!​ ​​

456
00:15:22,305 --> 00:15:27,277
​​​ ​Hey! You know,​ ​​
​​ ​I really like fantasizing about stuff!​ ​​

457
00:15:27,277 --> 00:15:31,180
​​​ ​Especially those of the romantic kind!​ ​​

458
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,417
​​​ ​In this segment, you'll be given a prompt​ ​​

459
00:15:34,417 --> 00:15:37,887
​​​ ​that you'll have to come up​ ​​
​​ ​with a fantasy about!​ ​​

460
00:15:37,887 --> 00:15:42,358
​​​ ​In other words, this is a segment​ ​​
​​ ​where we can enjoy romance fantasies!​ ​​

461
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,293
​​​ ​I'm also...​ ​​

462
00:15:43,293 --> 00:15:45,495
​​​ ​a big fan of romance ships and such, so...​ ​​

463
00:15:45,495 --> 00:15:48,164
​​​ ​Ehehehe...​ ​​

464
00:15:46,796 --> 00:15:48,164
​​​ ​Oh!​ ​​

465
00:15:48,164 --> 00:15:49,198
​​​ ​Ehehehehe...​ ​​

466
00:15:48,164 --> 00:15:49,198
​​​ ​Lovely, lovely.​ ​​

467
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,734
​​​ ​The prompt for this round is as follows!​ ​​

468
00:15:51,734 --> 00:15:53,436
​​​ ​Um, yeah.​ ​​

469
00:15:53,937 --> 00:15:58,141
​​​ ​"I pilot a robot in order to defend the Earth."​ ​​

470
00:15:58,141 --> 00:15:58,942
​​​ ​Yeah!​ ​​

471
00:15:58,942 --> 00:16:04,147
​​​ ​"On one fateful day, a boy​ ​​
​​ ​was assigned to pilot the same robot!"​ ​​

472
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,684
​​​ ​So, how about it, girls?​ ​​

473
00:16:06,683 --> 00:16:09,018
​​​ ​Sounds like science fiction.​ ​​

474
00:16:09,018 --> 00:16:10,720
​​​ ​I'm ready already!​ ​​

475
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,788
​​​ ​Okay! They're ready!​ ​​

476
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,788
​​​ ​All right!​ ​​

477
00:16:11,788 --> 00:16:15,291
​​​ ​Then let's start with IRyS this round.​ ​​
​​ ​Go ahead!​ ​​

478
00:16:14,857 --> 00:16:15,825
​​​ ​Okay!​ ​​

479
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:15,825
​​​ ​Sure!​ ​​

480
00:16:15,825 --> 00:16:16,292
​​​ ​Okay.​ ​​

481
00:16:17,327 --> 00:16:21,698
​​​ ​I'm someone who pilots​ ​​
​​ ​a robot to protect the Earth!​ ​​

482
00:16:21,698 --> 00:16:24,434
​​​ ​In addition, I attend a pilot academy.​ ​​

483
00:16:24,434 --> 00:16:26,569
​​​ ​The setting for this story is a school.​ ​​

484
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:29,472
​​​ ​And so... I'm a pilot, but—​ ​​

485
00:16:29,472 --> 00:16:31,207
​​​ ​I'm a pilot who really sucks.​ ​​

486
00:16:31,207 --> 00:16:33,176
​​​ ​Like, I can't do anything right...​ ​​

487
00:16:33,176 --> 00:16:37,413
​​​ ​my grades are rock bottom​ ​​
​​ ​and I'm the absolute worst student pilot.​ ​​

488
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,348
​​​ ​And there!​ ​​

489
00:16:38,348 --> 00:16:40,850
​​​ ​The pilot assigned to the same robot—​ ​​

490
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:44,320
​​​ ​A high-caliber, handsome boy shows up​ ​​

491
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,057
​​​ ​as a transfer student​ ​​
​​ ​in my pilot academy class!​ ​​

492
00:16:48,057 --> 00:16:51,127
​​​ ​And he's seated next to me. Of course.​ ​​

493
00:16:50,727 --> 00:16:51,661
​​​ ​Ooh.​ ​​

494
00:16:51,127 --> 00:16:53,830
​​​ ​The instructor is like, "You're first-rate,​ ​​

495
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:58,501
​​​ ​so please teach your neighbor IRyS a lot!"​ ​​

496
00:16:58,067 --> 00:16:59,769
​​​ ​Neighbors, huh!​ ​​

497
00:16:59,002 --> 00:17:01,437
​​​ ​And then some day, I uhh...​ ​​

498
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,972
​​​ ​On an exam day,​ ​​

499
00:17:02,972 --> 00:17:06,075
​​​ ​I have a lesson where​ ​​
​​ ​I needed to maneuver a robot,​ ​​

500
00:17:06,075 --> 00:17:08,378
​​​ ​but my robot doesn't budge!​ ​​

501
00:17:08,378 --> 00:17:10,380
​​​ ​So the guy next to me says,​ ​​

502
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,615
​​​ ​"Give it to me,"​ ​​
​​ ​in the cockpit of the same robot​ ​​

503
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:13,983
​​​ ​and it's really cramped!​ ​​

504
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:17,420
​​​ ​He makes his way into my seat.​ ​​

505
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:20,056
​​​ ​So the both of us are sitting on the same seat,​ ​​

506
00:17:18,087 --> 00:17:19,489
​​​ ​It's so cramped! 😍​ ​​

507
00:17:20,056 --> 00:17:24,660
​​​ ​and like, as a pilot there are​ ​​
​​ ​a bunch of handles and controls​ ​​

508
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,229
​​​ ​you have to hold, right?​ ​​

509
00:17:26,229 --> 00:17:30,733
​​​ ​He places his hands on top of mine,​ ​​

510
00:17:30,733 --> 00:17:34,203
​​​ ​and says,​ ​​
​​ ​"This is how you maneuver the robot.​ ​​

511
00:17:34,203 --> 00:17:36,739
​​​ ​Using this method,​ ​​

512
00:17:36,739 --> 00:17:39,008
​​​ ​if you grip the handles like this,​ ​​

513
00:17:39,008 --> 00:17:41,244
​​​ ​you can move like so-and-so."​ ​​

514
00:17:41,244 --> 00:17:43,146
​​​ ​With a stud demeanor and all.​ ​​

515
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:44,847
​​​ ​That makes me swoon.​ ​​

516
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,847
​​​ ​That's creepy!​ ​​

517
00:17:46,883 --> 00:17:50,787
​​​ ​And then just like that,​ ​​
​​ ​my grades steadily go up.​ ​​

518
00:17:50,787 --> 00:17:53,389
​​​ ​And as a result of his guidance,​ ​​

519
00:17:53,389 --> 00:17:57,126
​​​ ​we find ourselves fighting for​ ​​
​​ ​the top spots in the class rankings.​ ​​

520
00:17:57,126 --> 00:17:59,996
​​​ ​So we end up as a supreme couple.​ ​​

521
00:18:02,698 --> 00:18:04,767
​​​ ​Nice.​ ​​

522
00:18:04,767 --> 00:18:07,670
​​​ ​That was pretty romantic.​ ​​

523
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:07,670
​​​ ​Mhm.​ ​​

524
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,540
​​​ ​Having a high caliber pilot boyfriend​ ​​

525
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:13,042
​​​ ​who'll teach you all the ropes is pretty nice.​ ​​

526
00:18:13,042 --> 00:18:14,644
​​​ ​Okay!​ ​​

527
00:18:14,644 --> 00:18:15,745
​​​ ​That was nice!​ ​​

528
00:18:15,745 --> 00:18:19,482
​​​ ​Now then, Kiara, tell us your fantasy!​ ​​

529
00:18:19,482 --> 00:18:20,817
​​​ ​It's pretty simple.​ ​​

530
00:18:20,817 --> 00:18:22,351
​​​ ​First off.​ ​​

531
00:18:20,817 --> 00:18:22,351
​​​ ​Simple?​ ​​

532
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,120
​​​ ​A boy appears.​ ​​

533
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,389
​​​ ​The boy, of course,​ ​​

534
00:18:26,389 --> 00:18:30,359
​​​ ​has a talent for piloting robots.​ ​​

535
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,461
​​​ ​He's really good.​ ​​

536
00:18:31,461 --> 00:18:33,096
​​​ ​But, so am I!​ ​​

537
00:18:33,096 --> 00:18:36,632
​​​ ​So we become rivals at first.​ ​​

538
00:18:35,731 --> 00:18:37,667
​​​ ​I see where this is going!​ ​​

539
00:18:36,632 --> 00:18:38,101
​​​ ​Both of us are good in the beginning.​ ​​

540
00:18:38,101 --> 00:18:41,104
​​​ ​So, both of us cooperate and...​ ​​

541
00:18:41,104 --> 00:18:43,005
​​​ ​...go out to fight in the robots.​ ​​

542
00:18:43,005 --> 00:18:44,440
​​​ ​Uh-huh.​ ​​

543
00:18:43,573 --> 00:18:45,875
​​​ ​And then, in one of those fights,​ ​​

544
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:49,879
​​​ ​alas, my robot gets destroyed!​ ​​

545
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:50,980
​​​ ​Oh no!​ ​​

546
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,916
​​​ ​And then, listen!​ ​​
​​ ​It wasn't limited to just the robot!​ ​​

547
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:56,018
​​​ ​All of my bones break, too!​ ​​

548
00:18:56,018 --> 00:18:57,920
​​​ ​It's another one of those, huh? (lol)​ ​​

549
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,023
​​​ ​Now it's Kiara's turn in the wheelchair, huh!​ ​​

550
00:18:58,187 --> 00:19:01,023
​​​ ​She answered with broken bones​ ​​
​​ ​in the previous prompt, too.​ ​​

551
00:19:01,023 --> 00:19:02,925
​​​ ​"Ow! I crashed into someone!​ ​​

552
00:19:02,925 --> 00:19:05,828
​​​ ​That was an explosive collision!"​ ​​

553
00:19:05,828 --> 00:19:07,530
​​​ ​Kiara then looks at the victim​ ​​

554
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:08,397
​​​ ​and exclaims.​ ​​

555
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,167
​​​ ​They're bleeding out!​ ​​

556
00:19:11,167 --> 00:19:13,736
​​​ ​On top of that, their bones are broken!​ ​​

557
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:15,438
​​​ ​How's this supposed to turn into love? (lol)​ ​​

558
00:19:15,438 --> 00:19:16,405
​​​ ​Wait! Listen!​ ​​

559
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,740
​​​ ​Wha—​ ​​

560
00:19:18,207 --> 00:19:19,609
​​​ ​That approach again, huh.​ ​​

561
00:19:18,207 --> 00:19:21,677
​​​ ​And the guy's by my side.​ ​​

562
00:19:21,677 --> 00:19:24,614
​​​ ​"You'll watch over me​ ​​
​​ ​until I meet my end, right?"​ ​​

563
00:19:24,614 --> 00:19:26,449
​​​ ​And they fall in love.​ ​​

564
00:19:27,216 --> 00:19:29,652
​​​ ​But wait, why does​ ​​
​​ ​he have to take care of you?​ ​​

565
00:19:29,652 --> 00:19:33,489
​​​ ​It's not like it's his fault that​ ​​
​​ ​Kiara got hurt in this situation...​ ​​

566
00:19:32,955 --> 00:19:34,290
​​​ ​No idea!​ ​​

567
00:19:33,489 --> 00:19:35,158
​​​ ​It was the bad guy, wasn't it?​ ​​

568
00:19:34,357 --> 00:19:35,158
​​​ ​Why?!​ ​​

569
00:19:35,158 --> 00:19:37,360
​​​ ​Don't ask me about the details!​ ​​

570
00:19:37,994 --> 00:19:39,996
​​​ ​Well, he is a nice guy after all...​ ​​

571
00:19:39,795 --> 00:19:41,397
​​​ ​Oh okay.​ ​​

572
00:19:39,996 --> 00:19:42,865
​​​ ​A kind, handsome, and prodigious person.​ ​​

573
00:19:42,131 --> 00:19:45,468
​​​ ​Well, I'm sure he liked Kiara​ ​​
​​ ​from the start, anyway.​ ​​

574
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:44,567
​​​ ​Yeah!​ ​​

575
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:46,169
​​​ ​Oh, probably...​ ​​

576
00:19:46,169 --> 00:19:50,573
​​​ ​We're rivals, but we end up​ ​​
​​ ​coming to like each other a little.​ ​​

577
00:19:49,872 --> 00:19:51,374
​​​ ​Uh-huh...​ ​​

578
00:19:50,573 --> 00:19:54,577
​​​ ​And he's like,​ ​​
​​ ​"I feel bad for you so I'll take care of you."​ ​​

579
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:54,577
​​​ ​"I feel bad for you"?!​ ​​

580
00:19:54,577 --> 00:19:57,413
​​​ ​Really now?​ ​​

581
00:19:58,147 --> 00:19:59,282
​​​ ​Now then.​ ​​

582
00:19:58,147 --> 00:20:00,449
​​​ ​Okay.​ ​​

583
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,717
​​​ ​That's romantic.​ ​​

584
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,717
​​​ ​Reine, what about you?​ ​​

585
00:20:01,717 --> 00:20:03,519
​​​ ​But what's with the bones?​ ​​

586
00:20:04,754 --> 00:20:06,656
​​​ ​My face hurts.​ ​​

587
00:20:04,754 --> 00:20:06,656
​​​ ​That's hard to ignore.​ ​​

588
00:20:04,754 --> 00:20:06,656
​​​ ​She has a point.​ ​​

589
00:20:06,656 --> 00:20:07,390
​​​ ​Yeah.​ ​​

590
00:20:06,656 --> 00:20:07,890
​​​ ​Uh-huh.​ ​​

591
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,592
​​​ ​Reine-chan, how about you?​ ​​

592
00:20:10,092 --> 00:20:12,528
​​​ ​My story?​ ​​

593
00:20:12,528 --> 00:20:16,365
​​​ ​It's a little similar to Kiara's, actually.​ ​​

594
00:20:16,365 --> 00:20:18,367
​​​ ​And I'm not talking about the bones!​ ​​

595
00:20:16,766 --> 00:20:17,567
​​​ ​Oh!​ ​​

596
00:20:18,668 --> 00:20:19,802
​​​ ​But—​ ​​

597
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:21,237
​​​ ​Yeah, not the bones.​ ​​

598
00:20:21,237 --> 00:20:22,772
​​​ ​I'll be quick.​ ​​

599
00:20:22,772 --> 00:20:26,008
​​​ ​I'm a first-rate pilot.​ ​​

600
00:20:26,008 --> 00:20:30,780
​​​ ​I'm always placing first​ ​​
​​ ​in exams and exercises.​ ​​

601
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:35,117
​​​ ​Then, one day, a male pilot prodigy​ ​​
​​ ​joined the academy.​ ​​

602
00:20:35,117 --> 00:20:40,056
​​​ ​Ever since then,​ ​​
​​ ​I started placing second in everything.​ ​​

603
00:20:40,056 --> 00:20:40,823
​​​ ​Oh my!​ ​​

604
00:20:40,056 --> 00:20:40,823
​​​ ​But!​ ​​

605
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:42,291
​​​ ​Ooh.​ ​​

606
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:45,328
​​​ ​That guy just becomes my rival.​ ​​

607
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:48,931
​​​ ​We become pillars​ ​​
​​ ​for each other, so it's fine.​ ​​

608
00:20:48,931 --> 00:20:51,601
​​​ ​So, we're getting along very well, yeah?​ ​​

609
00:20:48,931 --> 00:20:50,466
​​​ ​Nice.​ ​​

610
00:20:51,601 --> 00:20:52,835
​​​ ​But then the other students...​ ​​

611
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:56,372
​​​ ​"What's with this girl?"​ ​​

612
00:20:56,372 --> 00:20:59,375
​​​ ​"Why's she so buddy-buddy with the stud?"​ ​​

613
00:20:58,307 --> 00:21:00,009
​​​ ​They're jealous?!​ ​​

614
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:00,910
​​​ ​"Eww."​ ​​

615
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:01,811
​​​ ​And for example,​ ​​

616
00:21:01,811 --> 00:21:04,614
​​​ ​with the plane I pilot—​ ​​

617
00:21:04,614 --> 00:21:06,215
​​​ ​I mean, the robot—​ ​​

618
00:21:06,215 --> 00:21:07,750
​​​ ​They rough it up and whatnot.​ ​​

619
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,619
​​​ ​And...​ ​​

620
00:21:08,618 --> 00:21:09,619
​​​ ​That's blatant bullying!​ ​​

621
00:21:09,385 --> 00:21:10,653
​​​ ​Wha...​ ​​

622
00:21:09,619 --> 00:21:10,653
​​​ ​Yeah, bullying!​ ​​

623
00:21:10,653 --> 00:21:14,357
​​​ ​And then, that bullying goes too far!​ ​​

624
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:16,225
​​​ ​Too far! They go overboard once​ ​​

625
00:21:16,225 --> 00:21:18,494
​​​ ​and I end up getting injured.​ ​​

626
00:21:18,494 --> 00:21:19,562
​​​ ​But!​ ​​

627
00:21:20,129 --> 00:21:23,532
​​​ ​"It's too bad that girl got hurt!​ ​​

628
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:27,937
​​​ ​Stud-kun, why don't you practice with me?"​ ​​

629
00:21:27,503 --> 00:21:29,472
​​​ ​Girl, shut up!​ ​​

630
00:21:27,937 --> 00:21:30,039
​​​ ​But the guy is like,​ ​​

631
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:33,142
​​​ ​"No can do. I know someone's behind this!​ ​​

632
00:21:33,142 --> 00:21:36,846
​​​ ​I'll have to investigate this."​ ​​

633
00:21:36,846 --> 00:21:39,081
​​​ ​So he looks into who did it,​ ​​

634
00:21:39,081 --> 00:21:41,117
​​​ ​and they get caught in the end.​ ​​

635
00:21:41,117 --> 00:21:42,018
​​​ ​Yeah.​ ​​

636
00:21:41,117 --> 00:21:43,586
​​​ ​The perpetrator is identified.​ ​​

637
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,720
​​​ ​Yeah, he finds the perpetrator,​ ​​

638
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,223
​​​ ​and for my sake, says,​ ​​

639
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:48,424
​​​ ​"Listen up, everyone!​ ​​

640
00:21:48,424 --> 00:21:50,760
​​​ ​This girl—​ ​​

641
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:54,630
​​​ ​This girl is mine, so keep your hands off her!"​ ​​

642
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,899
​​​ ​He announces that and...​ ​​

643
00:21:55,464 --> 00:21:56,399
​​​ ​Ooh!​ ​​

644
00:21:56,399 --> 00:21:57,600
​​​ ​Oh my!​ ​​

645
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:59,535
​​​ ​Yeah. Happily ever after.​ ​​

646
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,535
​​​ ​That's sure to make you swoon!​ ​​

647
00:21:59,535 --> 00:22:00,536
​​​ ​Yay!​ ​​

648
00:22:00,536 --> 00:22:02,772
​​​ ​"My woman!"​ ​​

649
00:22:01,804 --> 00:22:05,675
​​​ ​Woo!​ ​​

650
00:22:02,772 --> 00:22:04,940
​​​ ​Yay!​ ​​

651
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,977
​​​ ​It was an ordinary love story.​ ​​

652
00:22:07,977 --> 00:22:09,979
​​​ ​Nice!​ ​​

653
00:22:08,611 --> 00:22:09,979
​​​ ​Ordinary is best.​ ​​

654
00:22:09,979 --> 00:22:11,547
​​​ ​Ordinary is best!​ ​​

655
00:22:11,547 --> 00:22:12,181
​​​ ​Right?​ ​​

656
00:22:11,547 --> 00:22:12,748
​​​ ​Ordinary is best, yep.​ ​​

657
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:16,485
​​​ ​Better than having to tend to​ ​​
​​ ​someone's broken bones for life, at least.​ ​​

658
00:22:16,485 --> 00:22:21,557
​​​ ​I can feel a lot of potential​ ​​
​​ ​from this segment.​ ​​

659
00:22:21,557 --> 00:22:26,295
​​​ ​I'd like to do a whole stream​ ​​
​​ ​just with this theme alone.​ ​​

660
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:26,295
​​​ ​We could do a whole episode, yeah.​ ​​

661
00:22:26,495 --> 00:22:30,166
​​​ ​The next segment we're doing is called:​ ​​

662
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:34,036
​​​ ​"Japanese Athletic Park"!​ ​​

663
00:22:34,737 --> 00:22:39,108
​​​ ​This is IRyS-chan's segment.​ ​​
​​ ​It's finally here!​ ​​

664
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:41,310
​​​ ​Yay, my first one!​ ​​

665
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:44,046
​​​ ​It's a completely new segment!​ ​​

666
00:22:44,046 --> 00:22:45,014
​​​ ​Congrats.​ ​​

667
00:22:45,014 --> 00:22:46,682
​​​ ​Thank you, thank you.​ ​​

668
00:22:46,682 --> 00:22:50,119
​​​ ​We're all from EN and ID here,​ ​​

669
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:53,823
​​​ ​but we also put a lot of effort​ ​​
​​ ​into our Japanese skills, don't we?​ ​​

670
00:22:54,757 --> 00:22:59,995
​​​ ​That's why I decided to go with​ ​​
​​ ​a few Japanese language games!​ ​​

671
00:22:54,757 --> 00:22:56,759
​​​ ​S-Sure.​ ​​

672
00:22:59,995 --> 00:23:01,464
​​​ ​As you will see.​ ​​

673
00:23:02,331 --> 00:23:03,766
​​​ ​Japanese language games, huh?​ ​​

674
00:23:03,766 --> 00:23:05,234
​​​ ​Japanese! Oh my!​ ​​

675
00:23:05,234 --> 00:23:07,470
​​​ ​You're both good at Japanese, right?​ ​​

676
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,037
​​​ ​Right?​ ​​

677
00:23:08,037 --> 00:23:09,872
​​​ ​Are you keeping up with your studies?​ ​​

678
00:23:09,872 --> 00:23:11,040
​​​ ​Maintaining your skills?​ ​​

679
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,342
​​​ ​To be honest, I'm not.​ ​​

680
00:23:13,342 --> 00:23:16,846
​​​ ​If anything,​ ​​
​​ ​I feel my Japanese is getting worse.​ ​​

681
00:23:16,846 --> 00:23:18,280
​​​ ​Same!​ ​​

682
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,584
​​​ ​Then this segment​ ​​
​​ ​will be a good opportunity​ ​​

683
00:23:21,584 --> 00:23:26,989
​​​ ​to brush up on your skills, I think.​ ​​

684
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:30,693
​​​ ​Let's get right to it​ ​​
​​ ​and give the games a try!​ ​​

685
00:23:30,693 --> 00:23:32,928
​​​ ​You had better join in, too.​ ​​

686
00:23:32,928 --> 00:23:34,697
​​​ ​Huh? What?​ ​​

687
00:23:34,697 --> 00:23:37,433
​​​ ​I participated in​ ​​
​​ ​my own game too, after all.​ ​​

688
00:23:37,433 --> 00:23:40,736
​​​ ​Your Japanese is​ ​​
​​ ​the best of us three, isn't it?​ ​​

689
00:23:40,736 --> 00:23:43,105
​​​ ​No, I n-never said that.​ ​​

690
00:23:43,105 --> 00:23:45,341
​​​ ​The first athletic activity is:​ ​​

691
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:50,246
​​​ ​"One of These Doesn't Belong"!​ ​​

692
00:23:50,246 --> 00:23:51,747
​​​ ​I'll show you an image that has​ ​​

693
00:23:51,747 --> 00:23:55,584
​​​ ​the same kanji repeated many times over.​ ​​

694
00:23:55,584 --> 00:23:59,121
​​​ ​The aim of the game is to find the one kanji​ ​​

695
00:23:59,121 --> 00:24:01,257
​​​ ​that is different than the others.​ ​​

696
00:24:01,257 --> 00:24:05,995
​​​ ​I'll have you take turns,​ ​​
​​ ​answering one at a time.​ ​​

697
00:24:05,995 --> 00:24:07,363
​​​ ​I'll do it.​ ​​

698
00:24:05,995 --> 00:24:07,363
​​​ ​Any takers?​ ​​

699
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:08,330
​​​ ​I'll go first.​ ​​

700
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:10,800
​​​ ​Oh, we have a volunteer!​ ​​

701
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,936
​​​ ​Let's start with Kiara, then.​ ​​

702
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,936
​​​ ​Yes, I'm volunteering!​ ​​

703
00:24:13,936 --> 00:24:18,841
​​​ ​I think the first one will be the easiest.​ ​​

704
00:24:18,841 --> 00:24:20,910
​​​ ​Right, good point.​ ​​

705
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:24,146
​​​ ​The first question should be the easiest one.​ ​​

706
00:24:24,146 --> 00:24:26,449
​​​ ​That's a good strategy indeed.​ ​​

707
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:31,287
​​​ ​It's decided then! Kiara goes first!​ ​​

708
00:24:32,922 --> 00:24:34,790
​​​ ​You have 30 seconds to answer.​ ​​

709
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:37,560
​​​ ​Which of these doesn't belong? Start!​ ​​

710
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:42,298
​​​ ​Ah, found it.​ ​​

711
00:24:42,298 --> 00:24:47,136
​​​ ​It's on the bottom row,​ ​​
​​ ​second from the right.​ ​​

712
00:24:47,136 --> 00:24:48,971
​​​ ​Which kanji was that?​ ​​

713
00:24:48,971 --> 00:24:52,174
​​​ ​And what were the kanji around it?​ ​​

714
00:24:52,174 --> 00:24:54,910
​​​ ​The ones around it were "dog," right?​ ​​

715
00:24:54,910 --> 00:25:00,115
​​​ ​And the one I found​ ​​
​​ ​was the "ta" from "Tarou."​ ​​

716
00:25:00,115 --> 00:25:03,185
​​​ ​That's... probably...​ ​​

717
00:25:03,185 --> 00:25:05,921
​​​ ​It's also in <i>taiyou </i>(sun). Same one.​ ​​

718
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:09,358
​​​ ​That's true. It's probably correct then.​ ​​

719
00:25:09,358 --> 00:25:10,426
​​​ ​All right!​ ​​

720
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:14,129
​​​ ​You answered correctly for the position,​ ​​

721
00:25:14,129 --> 00:25:16,332
​​​ ​and I think the pronunciation is right too.​ ​​

722
00:25:16,332 --> 00:25:17,233
​​​ ​Of course it is!​ ​​

723
00:25:17,233 --> 00:25:19,835
​​​ ​You know it's correct, right? IRyS-sensei.​ ​​

724
00:25:19,835 --> 00:25:22,371
​​​ ​You know that much, don't you?​ ​​

725
00:25:22,371 --> 00:25:25,040
​​​ ​You're failing at your own game, IRyS-chan!​ ​​

726
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:28,210
​​​ ​I know it for its "fat" meaning,​ ​​

727
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:31,046
​​​ ​but that "ta from Tarou"​ ​​
​​ ​made me go, "Huh? What?"​ ​​

728
00:25:31,046 --> 00:25:33,482
​​​ ​All right, perfect answer!​ ​​

729
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,482
​​​ ​Well done!​ ​​

730
00:25:34,149 --> 00:25:36,085
​​​ ​I expected nothing less of you.​ ​​

731
00:25:36,085 --> 00:25:39,455
​​​ ​Next up is ReiRei.​ ​​

732
00:25:36,886 --> 00:25:39,455
​​​ ​Oh no!​ ​​

733
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:40,589
​​​ ​Go for it, Reine-chan!​ ​​

734
00:25:40,589 --> 00:25:42,424
​​​ ​Ready? Start!​ ​​

735
00:25:43,826 --> 00:25:46,028
​​​ ​Isn't this more like an eye test?​ ​​

736
00:25:46,862 --> 00:25:47,897
​​​ ​I found—​ ​​

737
00:25:47,897 --> 00:25:49,031
​​​ ​I found it!​ ​​

738
00:25:49,031 --> 00:25:51,467
​​​ ​But I don't know what it means.​ ​​

739
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:52,501
​​​ ​I found it, but...​ ​​

740
00:25:52,501 --> 00:25:54,503
​​​ ​I found it too, but I can't read it either.​ ​​

741
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:56,338
​​​ ​Ah, there it is!​ ​​

742
00:25:56,338 --> 00:25:57,773
​​​ ​The one that...​ ​​

743
00:25:57,773 --> 00:25:59,441
​​​ ​Huh? Wait, it disappeared!​ ​​

744
00:25:59,441 --> 00:26:03,212
​​​ ​The one that doesn't belong is​ ​​
​​ ​that thingy in the top right.​ ​​

745
00:26:03,212 --> 00:26:06,782
​​​ ​What kind of "thingy in the​ ​​
​​ ​top right" do you mean, exactly?​ ​​

746
00:26:06,782 --> 00:26:07,750
​​​ ​Huh? On the right?​ ​​

747
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:10,185
​​​ ​Wait, not right. Left! Left. Left.​ ​​

748
00:26:10,185 --> 00:26:12,288
​​​ ​You're all saying "right."​ ​​

749
00:26:12,288 --> 00:26:13,022
​​​ ​It's on the left.​ ​​

750
00:26:13,022 --> 00:26:14,423
​​​ ​I meant on the left.​ ​​

751
00:26:14,423 --> 00:26:16,425
​​​ ​So, what kanji was that?​ ​​

752
00:26:16,425 --> 00:26:18,561
​​​ ​It's... What...​ ​​

753
00:26:18,561 --> 00:26:20,596
​​​ ​What kanji is that? I don't know!​ ​​

754
00:26:20,596 --> 00:26:22,998
​​​ ​It's related to us.​ ​​

755
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:27,369
​​​ ​The surrounding kanji were related to us.​ ​​

756
00:26:23,866 --> 00:26:27,369
​​​ ​Yes, they're strongly related to us.​ ​​

757
00:26:27,369 --> 00:26:28,804
​​​ ​But the one—​ ​​

758
00:26:27,369 --> 00:26:28,804
​​​ ​The odd one out.​ ​​

759
00:26:28,804 --> 00:26:31,307
​​​ ​Yeah, how do you read the odd one out?​ ​​

760
00:26:31,307 --> 00:26:34,076
​​​ ​Was it "island"?​ ​​

761
00:26:31,307 --> 00:26:32,575
​​​ ​Is it...?​ ​​

762
00:26:32,575 --> 00:26:34,076
​​​ ​Was it "island"?​ ​​

763
00:26:34,076 --> 00:26:35,244
​​​ ​Yeah, I think it was.​ ​​

764
00:26:35,244 --> 00:26:36,011
​​​ ​Wait, no.​ ​​

765
00:26:35,244 --> 00:26:37,479
​​​ ​Let's take another look at it.​ ​​

766
00:26:36,312 --> 00:26:38,547
​​​ ​Mmh? Is it?​ ​​

767
00:26:36,478 --> 00:26:38,547
​​​ ​Sure, let's check it out!​ ​​

768
00:26:38,547 --> 00:26:39,481
​​​ ​Alright!​ ​​

769
00:26:39,481 --> 00:26:41,817
​​​ ​Yeah, that one.​ ​​

770
00:26:41,817 --> 00:26:42,651
​​​ ​I think...​ ​​

771
00:26:42,651 --> 00:26:43,652
​​​ ​Is it "island"?​ ​​

772
00:26:42,651 --> 00:26:46,255
​​​ ​I remember island being split on the top part...​ ​​

773
00:26:42,651 --> 00:26:44,186
​​​ ​It is "island," isn't it?​ ​​

774
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,255
​​​ ​Hang on, no! No!​ ​​

775
00:26:46,255 --> 00:26:48,190
​​​ ​It's not "island"! It's not "island"!​ ​​

776
00:26:46,589 --> 00:26:47,156
​​​ ​Right, no!​ ​​

777
00:26:47,156 --> 00:26:49,158
​​​ ​That kanji <i>is </i>"island," but...​ ​​

778
00:26:49,158 --> 00:26:49,825
​​​ ​Wait, no...​ ​​

779
00:26:49,825 --> 00:26:51,093
​​​ ​No, no! It's not "island"!​ ​​

780
00:26:51,093 --> 00:26:53,062
​​​ ​If it was "island,"​ ​​

781
00:26:51,093 --> 00:26:52,695
​​​ ​It's "bird"! It's "bird"!​ ​​

782
00:26:53,062 --> 00:26:55,364
​​​ ​it should have something​ ​​
​​ ​like the kanji "kan" below it!​ ​​

783
00:26:55,164 --> 00:26:55,364
​​​ ​Mmh?​ ​​

784
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:56,599
​​​ ​It's not "island."​ ​​

785
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:57,700
​​​ ​Then what is it?​ ​​

786
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:57,700
​​​ ​What's the one that didn't belong?​ ​​

787
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,335
​​​ ​No one knows...​ ​​

788
00:26:59,335 --> 00:27:00,703
​​​ ​Oh, "crow"?!​ ​​

789
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,737
​​​ ​Crow?​ ​​

790
00:27:00,302 --> 00:27:07,643
​​​ ​Crow​ ​​

791
00:27:00,703 --> 00:27:02,171
​​​ ​CROW?!​ ​​

792
00:27:00,703 --> 00:27:02,605
​​​ ​I had no idea!​ ​​

793
00:27:02,605 --> 00:27:05,107
​​​ ​I didn't know the kanji for "crow"!​ ​​

794
00:27:02,605 --> 00:27:04,206
​​​ ​How would we know?!​ ​​

795
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:05,674
​​​ ​Come on!​ ​​

796
00:27:05,674 --> 00:27:07,643
​​​ ​It was "crow"...​ ​​

797
00:27:07,643 --> 00:27:09,845
​​​ ​Turns out it was "crow"​ ​​

798
00:27:09,845 --> 00:27:11,981
​​​ ​and not one of us got it.​ ​​

799
00:27:11,981 --> 00:27:13,849
​​​ ​I guess it's time to​ ​​
​​ ​do some studying again.​ ​​

800
00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:15,384
​​​ ​Right.​ ​​

801
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:16,352
​​​ ​Yeah. Japanese is difficult.​ ​​

802
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:18,187
​​​ ​Kanji is difficult!​ ​​

803
00:27:17,419 --> 00:27:19,955
​​​ ​So difficult!​ ​​

804
00:27:19,188 --> 00:27:20,723
​​​ ​Alright!​ ​​

805
00:27:20,723 --> 00:27:22,825
​​​ ​First of all, never in my life​ ​​
​​ ​had I seen that kanji.​ ​​

806
00:27:22,825 --> 00:27:23,792
​​​ ​Same.​ ​​

807
00:27:22,825 --> 00:27:23,792
​​​ ​For real.​ ​​

808
00:27:23,792 --> 00:27:25,160
​​​ ​I had never seen it.​ ​​

809
00:27:24,326 --> 00:27:25,160
​​​ ​Yeah.​ ​​

810
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,630
​​​ ​Let's move on to the next athletic park!​ ​​

811
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:29,365
​​​ ​The next one is...!​ ​​

812
00:27:29,865 --> 00:27:31,634
​​​ ​"Hiragana on the Move!"​ ​​

813
00:27:31,634 --> 00:27:35,638
​​​ ​"Chase the Hiragana!"​ ​​

814
00:27:34,637 --> 00:27:35,638
​​​ ​Hiragana!​ ​​

815
00:27:35,638 --> 00:27:36,605
​​​ ​For this segment,​ ​​

816
00:27:36,605 --> 00:27:40,209
​​​ ​you'll be shown a video​ ​​
​​ ​with different hiragana characters.​ ​​

817
00:27:40,209 --> 00:27:42,745
​​​ ​If you find the proper arrangement,​ ​​

818
00:27:42,745 --> 00:27:44,546
​​​ ​that hiragana should form a word.​ ​​

819
00:27:44,546 --> 00:27:45,848
​​​ ​This challenge is to see​ ​​

820
00:27:45,848 --> 00:27:50,552
​​​ ​who of the three of us will be able​ ​​
​​ ​to find the correct word before the time limit.​ ​​

821
00:27:51,487 --> 00:27:52,621
​​​ ​Alright!​ ​​

822
00:27:52,621 --> 00:27:54,723
​​​ ​The time limit is 30 seconds!​ ​​

823
00:27:54,723 --> 00:27:57,626
​​​ ​Chase the Hiragana! Start!​ ​​

824
00:28:00,195 --> 00:28:00,963
​​​ ​Uhh...​ ​​

825
00:28:00,963 --> 00:28:01,597
​​​ ​Huh?​ ​​

826
00:28:03,866 --> 00:28:04,466
​​​ ​Wha...​ ​​

827
00:28:05,034 --> 00:28:06,068
​​​ ​Is this...​ ​​

828
00:28:06,068 --> 00:28:08,437
​​​ ​Oh! I think I got it!​ ​​

829
00:28:06,969 --> 00:28:08,704
​​​ ​I <i>think </i>I got it?​ ​​

830
00:28:08,704 --> 00:28:10,639
​​​ ​I'm not too sure, though.​ ​​

831
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:12,207
​​​ ​Is this the right answer?​ ​​

832
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:12,207
​​​ ​Mmh, okay.​ ​​

833
00:28:12,207 --> 00:28:13,042
​​​ ​I got it.​ ​​

834
00:28:13,042 --> 00:28:14,376
​​​ ​I'm not sure at all.​ ​​

835
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,779
​​​ ​It might actually...​ ​​

836
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:18,414
​​​ ​be something like this.​ ​​

837
00:28:18,414 --> 00:28:21,684
​​​ ​Alright, then please write your answers.​ ​​

838
00:28:21,684 --> 00:28:23,886
​​​ ​Everyone finished?​ ​​

839
00:28:23,886 --> 00:28:24,586
​​​ ​Yeah!​ ​​

840
00:28:23,886 --> 00:28:25,154
​​​ ​Finished!​ ​​

841
00:28:25,154 --> 00:28:26,622
​​​ ​Finished!​ ​​

842
00:28:25,154 --> 00:28:26,622
​​​ ​Alright!​ ​​

843
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:27,656
​​​ ​Well then,​ ​​

844
00:28:27,656 --> 00:28:29,925
​​​ ​let's look at the answer!​ ​​

845
00:28:30,259 --> 00:28:31,493
​​​ ​Ta-dah!​ ​​

846
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:36,565
​​​ ​Pumpkin! Yeah!​ ​​

847
00:28:33,896 --> 00:28:36,065
​​​ ​Pumpkin!​ ​​

848
00:28:36,065 --> 00:28:37,466
​​​ ​That's the correct answer!​ ​​

849
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:38,534
​​​ ​Yup.​ ​​

850
00:28:38,534 --> 00:28:40,402
​​​ ​It was pumpkin.​ ​​

851
00:28:40,402 --> 00:28:42,604
​​​ ​I was totally expecting a Japanese word...​ ​​

852
00:28:41,837 --> 00:28:42,604
​​​ ​Yeah!​ ​​

853
00:28:42,604 --> 00:28:45,040
​​​ ​I was thinking the same thing.​ ​​
​​ ​I didn't expect an English word.​ ​​

854
00:28:43,272 --> 00:28:46,942
​​​ ​...so I was confused when I read "pumpkin."​ ​​

855
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:49,678
​​​ ​I wasn't expecting that.​ ​​

856
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,678
​​​ ​That was hard.​ ​​

857
00:28:49,678 --> 00:28:52,314
​​​ ​Alright! Let's look at the right answer!​ ​​
​​ ​Just in case...​ ​​

858
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:54,016
​​​ ​Could it be pumpkin?​ ​​

859
00:28:54,016 --> 00:28:56,385
​​​ ​It has to.​ ​​

860
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:55,984
​​​ ​Pumpkin!​ ​​

861
00:28:56,385 --> 00:28:58,053
​​​ ​Or was it "<i>pmupkin</i>"?​ ​​

862
00:28:57,219 --> 00:28:58,921
​​<i>​ ​Pmupkin</i>!​ ​​

863
00:28:58,921 --> 00:29:00,489
​​​ ​Pumpkin!​ ​​

864
00:28:59,688 --> 00:29:03,125
​​​ ​Pumpkin!​ ​​

865
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:03,125
​​​ ​Nice! Pumpkin!​ ​​

866
00:29:00,889 --> 00:29:03,125
​​​ ​Alright!​ ​​

867
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:04,827
​​​ ​Everyone got it.​ ​​

868
00:29:03,459 --> 00:29:07,696
​​​ ​Everyone got it, let's gooo!​ ​​

869
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:07,696
​​​ ​Yaaay!​ ​​

870
00:29:07,696 --> 00:29:09,898
​​​ ​Oh, okay, okay!​ ​​

871
00:29:08,097 --> 00:29:15,037
​​​ ​All of them got the right answer​ ​​
​​ ​for the second question with ease​ ​​

872
00:29:08,197 --> 00:29:09,898
​​​ ​Oh, got it!​ ​​

873
00:29:09,898 --> 00:29:10,632
​​​ ​I got it!​ ​​

874
00:29:10,632 --> 00:29:12,601
​​​ ​I love your drawings, they're so cute.​ ​​

875
00:29:10,632 --> 00:29:14,002
​​​ ​It's "haunted house"!​ ​​

876
00:29:13,035 --> 00:29:15,037
​​​ ​"Haunted house"!​ ​​

877
00:29:15,037 --> 00:29:22,878
​​​ ​Let's see how they do​ ​​
​​ ​on the last and hardest question!​ ​​

878
00:29:15,037 --> 00:29:16,638
​​​ ​"Hause hounted."​ ​​

879
00:29:15,037 --> 00:29:16,638
​​​ ​"Hause hounted"...​ ​​

880
00:29:16,638 --> 00:29:17,506
​​​ ​Mhmm.​ ​​

881
00:29:17,206 --> 00:29:19,041
​​​ ​"Haunted house."​ ​​

882
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:20,676
​​​ ​"Haunted house"!​ ​​

883
00:29:18,774 --> 00:29:20,576
​​​ ​Yaaay!​ ​​

884
00:29:19,041 --> 00:29:22,878
​​​ ​That's right! Everyone got it right!​ ​​

885
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:22,878
​​​ ​Let's gooo!​ ​​

886
00:29:22,878 --> 00:29:23,879
​​​ ​For the last—​ ​​

887
00:29:23,879 --> 00:29:26,782
​​​ ​I'm sure everyone was​ ​​
​​ ​able to warm up by now,​ ​​

888
00:29:26,782 --> 00:29:29,184
​​​ ​so let's move on to the final question!​ ​​

889
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:31,553
​​​ ​30 seconds on the timer! Start!​ ​​

890
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:34,056
​​​ ​Whaaa...?!​ ​​

891
00:29:34,056 --> 00:29:34,556
​​​ ​What?​ ​​

892
00:29:34,556 --> 00:29:35,657
​​​ ​Uh...​ ​​

893
00:29:35,257 --> 00:29:36,325
​​​ ​That's so long. Hang on...​ ​​

894
00:29:36,325 --> 00:29:38,694
​​​ ​Yeah, this is—​ ​​
​​ ​This is way too long. What?​ ​​

895
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:40,028
​​​ ​Hold up, what?​ ​​

896
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:40,863
​​​ ​Mmmh?​ ​​

897
00:29:42,765 --> 00:29:43,732
​​​ ​It's like...​ ​​

898
00:29:43,565 --> 00:29:45,400
​​​ ​Can you please stop moving?!​ ​​

899
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,136
​​​ ​Please stop moving!​ ​​

900
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,704
​​​ ​🐔🐔🐔​ ​​

901
00:29:47,936 --> 00:29:48,704
​​​ ​What?​ ​​

902
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:49,371
​​​ ​What?​ ​​

903
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:49,805
​​​ ​Mmh?!​ ​​

904
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:53,175
​​​ ​Is this...​ ​​
​​ ​Is this one also Halloween-themed?​ ​​

905
00:29:53,175 --> 00:29:54,376
​​​ ​No idea.​ ​​

906
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:55,911
​​​ ​What is it?​ ​​

907
00:29:56,745 --> 00:29:58,647
​​​ ​I'll be honest, I have no idea...​ ​​

908
00:29:58,647 --> 00:30:00,349
​​​ ​For real, can they just stand still?​ ​​

909
00:29:58,981 --> 00:30:00,349
​​​ ​Hold on.​ ​​

910
00:30:00,349 --> 00:30:01,784
​​​ ​Oh! I got it! I got it!​ ​​

911
00:30:01,784 --> 00:30:02,851
​​​ ​I got it! I got it!​ ​​

912
00:30:02,851 --> 00:30:03,919
​​​ ​I think I got it!​ ​​

913
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,921
​​​ ​I don't have the slightest clue!​ ​​

914
00:30:05,921 --> 00:30:07,322
​​​ ​Not even a clue!​ ​​

915
00:30:06,522 --> 00:30:09,424
​​​ ​I think I got half of it...?​ ​​

916
00:30:07,322 --> 00:30:09,424
​​​ ​It might not be related...​ ​​

917
00:30:09,424 --> 00:30:10,793
​​​ ​I don't know.​ ​​

918
00:30:10,793 --> 00:30:13,796
​​​ ​I saw something,​ ​​
​​ ​but it wasn't related to Halloween.​ ​​

919
00:30:12,828 --> 00:30:13,796
​​​ ​Oh, sorry.​ ​​

920
00:30:13,796 --> 00:30:16,131
​​​ ​Oh, I see!​ ​​

921
00:30:16,131 --> 00:30:17,299
​​​ ​"Oh, I see"?​ ​​

922
00:30:17,299 --> 00:30:19,368
​​​ ​Are you looking at my answer?!​ ​​

923
00:30:17,666 --> 00:30:18,500
​​​ ​Oh, no, no!​ ​​

924
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,736
​​​ ​I'm not changing my answer,​ ​​

925
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:22,237
​​​ ​but I see what you mean now.​ ​​

926
00:30:22,905 --> 00:30:26,175
​​​ ​I <i>think </i>this is it.​ ​​

927
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:24,807
​​​ ​I didn't get that.​ ​​

928
00:30:26,175 --> 00:30:28,544
​​​ ​I'm not sure yet.​ ​​
​​ ​Did you girls write your answers?​ ​​

929
00:30:28,544 --> 00:30:31,280
​​​ ​I'm thinking this is it. I don't know.​ ​​

930
00:30:30,112 --> 00:30:31,814
​​​ ​Reine didn't get it either!​ ​​

931
00:30:31,814 --> 00:30:32,648
​​​ ​Yay!​ ​​

932
00:30:32,648 --> 00:30:33,582
​​​ ​High five!​ ​​

933
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:34,917
​​​ ​High five, Reine-chan!​ ​​

934
00:30:37,986 --> 00:30:40,055
​​​ ​Reine-chan! Reine-chan!​ ​​

935
00:30:37,986 --> 00:30:40,055
​​​ ​Hold on, I'm still writing this.​ ​​

936
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,789
​​​ ​Your hand...​ ​​

937
00:30:40,055 --> 00:30:41,190
​​​ ​I'm still writing...​ ​​

938
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,324
​​​ ​She do be writing.​ ​​

939
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:43,425
​​​ ​Reine-chan, look at the screen.​ ​​

940
00:30:43,892 --> 00:30:44,626
​​​ ​Okay.​ ​​

941
00:30:43,892 --> 00:30:44,960
​​​ ​High five!​ ​​

942
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,261
​​​ ​High five!!​ ​​

943
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,261
​​​ ​High five!​ ​​

944
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:47,663
​​​ ​Wait, I can't do that!​ ​​

945
00:30:49,131 --> 00:30:49,565
​​​ ​Okay.​ ​​

946
00:30:49,565 --> 00:30:53,468
​​​ ​Alright, let's look at everyone's answers.​ ​​

947
00:30:53,468 --> 00:30:54,770
​​​ ​Ta-dah!​ ​​

948
00:30:57,339 --> 00:30:58,106
​​​ ​That's not even—!​ ​​

949
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:58,874
​​​ ​Girls?​ ​​

950
00:30:58,874 --> 00:30:59,775
​​​ ​Huh?​ ​​

951
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:01,210
​​​ ​Girls?​ ​​

952
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:02,177
​​​ ​Are you guys trying?​ ​​

953
00:31:02,177 --> 00:31:03,946
​​​ ​What is this?​ ​​

954
00:31:03,946 --> 00:31:06,882
​​​ ​Trust me, all I could make out was "muscles."​ ​​

955
00:31:05,414 --> 00:31:08,016
​​​ ​Yeah, I also tried my best!​ ​​

956
00:31:06,882 --> 00:31:09,251
​​​ ​I saw "muscles"!​ ​​

957
00:31:06,882 --> 00:31:09,251
​​​ ​But there was a hiragana for "ya"!​ ​​

958
00:31:09,251 --> 00:31:10,152
​​​ ​What happened with your answer, Reine?​ ​​

959
00:31:10,152 --> 00:31:13,322
​​​ ​Why are you promoting your channel here?​ ​​

960
00:31:14,189 --> 00:31:15,724
​​​ ​You gave up...​ ​​

961
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:16,258
​​​ ​Please subscribe to my channel!​ ​​

962
00:31:16,258 --> 00:31:17,492
​​​ ​Pavolia Reine! Look me up!​ ​​

963
00:31:16,491 --> 00:31:18,427
​​​ ​You gave up...​ ​​

964
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:18,961
​​​ ​Yaaay!​ ​​

965
00:31:17,492 --> 00:31:18,961
​​​ ​I'll be waiting!​ ​​

966
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:20,495
​​​ ​Nice plug!​ ​​

967
00:31:19,228 --> 00:31:20,495
​​​ ​I actually tried, though!​ ​​

968
00:31:20,495 --> 00:31:21,763
​​​ ​Right, I can see that.​ ​​

969
00:31:21,763 --> 00:31:24,366
​​​ ​Your effort shows on that drawing.​ ​​

970
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:25,934
​​​ ​Exactly.​ ​​

971
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,669
​​​ ​Now... "muscles."​ ​​

972
00:31:27,669 --> 00:31:28,503
​​​ ​There was also a "ya" there.​ ​​

973
00:31:28,503 --> 00:31:31,740
​​​ ​The phrase I saw is, "Special with grilled meat."​ ​​

974
00:31:29,771 --> 00:31:32,274
​​​ ​See, I actually read the "grilled meat" part.​ ​​

975
00:31:32,274 --> 00:31:33,742
​​​ ​But I was like, "Is it that? What?"​ ​​

976
00:31:33,742 --> 00:31:35,244
​​​ ​I saw "special with grilled meat."​ ​​

977
00:31:33,742 --> 00:31:35,777
​​​ ​I was missing the "special" part...​ ​​

978
00:31:35,244 --> 00:31:37,512
​​​ ​That's my guess, but I'm not sure.​ ​​

979
00:31:36,178 --> 00:31:37,145
​​​ ​Is it that?​ ​​

980
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,647
​​​ ​I don't know.​ ​​

981
00:31:37,512 --> 00:31:39,147
​​​ ​I don't know! If I'm being honest,​ ​​

982
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:40,983
​​​ ​I'm not 100% sure, so...!​ ​​

983
00:31:40,983 --> 00:31:43,485
​​​ ​Let's take a look again at the video​ ​​

984
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:45,454
​​​ ​and see the answer!​ ​​

985
00:31:47,189 --> 00:31:49,558
​​​ ​It <i>has </i>to be that.​ ​​

986
00:31:49,558 --> 00:31:51,126
​​​ ​"Grilled..."​ ​​

987
00:31:52,027 --> 00:31:53,195
​​​ ​"meat..."​ ​​

988
00:31:52,961 --> 00:31:54,496
​​​ ​Yeah, I got that part—​ ​​

989
00:31:53,195 --> 00:31:53,996
​​​ ​Wait, oh?​ ​​

990
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:54,596
​​​ ​Yeah, it is.​ ​​

991
00:31:54,596 --> 00:31:58,066
​​​ ​"Special with grilled meat"!​ ​​

992
00:31:54,596 --> 00:31:56,498
​​​ ​I was right!​ ​​

993
00:31:54,596 --> 00:31:56,498
​​​ ​Oh, it <i>was </i>that!​ ​​

994
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:58,901
​​​ ​It was "Special with grilled meat."​ ​​

995
00:31:58,901 --> 00:31:59,468
​​​ ​But hold on!​ ​​

996
00:31:59,468 --> 00:32:01,970
​​​ ​Why that? All other ones​ ​​
​​ ​were Halloween-themed.​ ​​

997
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:04,106
​​​ ​Where did "Special with​ ​​
​​ ​grilled meat" come from?​ ​​

998
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:04,106
​​​ ​Right?​ ​​

999
00:32:05,974 --> 00:32:08,176
​​​ ​Once Halloween is over,​ ​​
​​ ​you can eat a special with grilled meat.​ ​​

1000
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,679
​​​ ​I'd love to eat that every day.​ ​​

1001
00:32:09,044 --> 00:32:12,848
​​​ ​Maybe it was there to confuse us.​ ​​

1002
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,615
​​​ ​Man, I want to eat that now.​ ​​

1003
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:14,716
​​​ ​Right, so they sent us a curve ball​ ​​

1004
00:32:14,716 --> 00:32:17,319
​​​ ​and made it super long on top of that.​ ​​
​​ ​That was hard.​ ​​

1005
00:32:17,552 --> 00:32:19,221
​​​ ​That was so much fun!​ ​​

1006
00:32:18,487 --> 00:32:19,988
​​​ ​That was really fun!​ ​​

1007
00:32:19,221 --> 00:32:24,326
​​​ ​So, how did you all enjoy today's episode?​ ​​

1008
00:32:24,326 --> 00:32:26,428
​​​ ​It was really jam-packed!​ ​​

1009
00:32:26,428 --> 00:32:27,663
​​​ ​Yeah!​ ​​

1010
00:32:26,428 --> 00:32:27,663
​​​ ​Wasn't it?​ ​​

1011
00:32:27,663 --> 00:32:29,831
​​​ ​We went on for so long,​ ​​

1012
00:32:29,831 --> 00:32:32,367
​​​ ​staff will probably have to cut half of it.​ ​​

1013
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,002
​​​ ​I know, right?​ ​​

1014
00:32:34,002 --> 00:32:36,605
​​​ ​I'm sure that's what'll end up happening.​ ​​

1015
00:32:36,605 --> 00:32:40,375
​​​ ​I can't wait to see how they edit it down.​ ​​

1016
00:32:39,942 --> 00:32:41,310
​​​ ​Same!​ ​​

1017
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:41,877
​​​ ​Well...​ ​​

1018
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:43,712
​​​ ​I laughed a lot today, too.​ ​​

1019
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:43,211
​​​ ​Well, actually,​ ​​

1020
00:32:44,513 --> 00:32:46,315
​​​ ​I have a request for staff right now:​ ​​

1021
00:32:46,315 --> 00:32:49,885
​​​ ​please make this episode an hour long!​ ​​

1022
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:51,586
​​​ ​The reason being,​ ​​

1023
00:32:51,586 --> 00:32:55,090
​​​ ​today's episode was, believe it or not,​ ​​

1024
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:57,526
​​​ ​the final episode!​ ​​

1025
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:58,393
​​​ ​What?!​ ​​

1026
00:32:57,526 --> 00:32:59,895
​​​ ​Whaaa?!​ ​​

1027
00:32:57,693 --> 00:33:00,062
​​​ ​What?!​ ​​

1028
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:01,196
​​​ ​Nobody told us! It's the last episode?!​ ​​

1029
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:03,031
​​​ ​Seriously?!​ ​​

1030
00:33:01,997 --> 00:33:03,031
​​​ ​Seriously.​ ​​

1031
00:33:03,031 --> 00:33:06,168
​​​ ​Yeah, staff told me just before we started.​ ​​

1032
00:33:06,168 --> 00:33:08,971
​​​ ​This episode will be the last.​ ​​

1033
00:33:08,971 --> 00:33:16,745
​​​ ​And for some reason, this show on the​ ​​
​​ ​JP channel ended with all non-JP members.​ ​​

1034
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:18,513
​​​ ​Seriously, why?!​ ​​

1035
00:33:18,046 --> 00:33:19,514
​​​ ​Really?​ ​​

1036
00:33:18,513 --> 00:33:20,916
​​​ ​How come?​ ​​

1037
00:33:19,848 --> 00:33:20,916
​​​ ​Right?​ ​​

1038
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:21,850
​​​ ​Well, you know.​ ​​

1039
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:25,954
​​​ ​This show has been running​ ​​
​​ ​for nearly two years.​ ​​

1040
00:33:25,954 --> 00:33:30,092
​​​ ​I guess staff wants to​ ​​
​​ ​try something new by now.​ ​​

1041
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:31,460
​​​ ​I know the feeling.​ ​​

1042
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,527
​​​ ​I see.​ ​​

1043
00:33:32,527 --> 00:33:38,000
​​​ ​But it's really an honor to get​ ​​
​​ ​to participate in the final episode.​ ​​

1044
00:33:37,132 --> 00:33:38,000
​​​ ​I know!​ ​​

1045
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,633
​​​ ​Isn't it?​ ​​

1046
00:33:38,633 --> 00:33:44,072
​​​ ​I was pretty nervous to be​ ​​
​​ ​the MC for the final episode,​ ​​

1047
00:33:44,072 --> 00:33:45,640
​​​ ​but it was an honor. Thank you.​ ​​

1048
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,476
​​​ ​Thank you, staff!​ ​​

1049
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,944
​​​ ​Thank you so much!​ ​​

1050
00:33:46,541 --> 00:33:48,944
​​​ ​Thank you so much!​ ​​

1051
00:33:49,711 --> 00:33:54,016
​​​ ​And let's give the staff​ ​​
​​ ​who worked on this show for two years​ ​​

1052
00:33:54,016 --> 00:33:55,784
​​​ ​a round of applause!​ ​​

1053
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:56,118
​​​ ​Applause!​ ​​

1054
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:58,553
​​​ ​Yay!​ ​​

1055
00:33:56,118 --> 00:33:59,554
​​​ ​Thank you so much!​ ​​

1056
00:33:58,553 --> 00:34:02,024
​​​ ​This has been such a fun show throughout.​ ​​

1057
00:34:02,024 --> 00:34:03,759
​​​ ​I'm glad I got to participate,​ ​​

1058
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:05,927
​​​ ​Glad I got to be here!​ ​​

1059
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:06,461
​​​ ​I'm glad we could invite Reine-chan,​ ​​

1060
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:10,599
​​​ ​and I'm glad IRyS-chan could join in​ ​​
​​ ​too, even for just one episode.​ ​​

1061
00:34:09,998 --> 00:34:11,066
​​​ ​It was my pleasure!​ ​​

1062
00:34:11,066 --> 00:34:12,934
​​​ ​It's a little sad​ ​​

1063
00:34:12,934 --> 00:34:18,774
​​​ ​but I'm sure staff has even more​ ​​
​​ ​fun stuff in store for us.​ ​​

1064
00:34:17,873 --> 00:34:18,774
​​​ ​Definitely!​ ​​

1065
00:34:18,774 --> 00:34:19,608
​​​ ​Right?​ ​​

1066
00:34:18,774 --> 00:34:22,244
​​​ ​There are fun new ideas​ ​​
​​ ​and shows coming out all the time,​ ​​

1067
00:34:22,244 --> 00:34:26,915
​​​ ​so please go support the other shows, too!​ ​​

1068
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,915
​​​ ​Yeah!​ ​​

1069
00:34:26,915 --> 00:34:28,717
​​​ ​And, with that,​ ​​

1070
00:34:28,717 --> 00:34:32,888
​​​ ​this has been Takanashi Kiara...​ ​​

1071
00:34:32,888 --> 00:34:34,756
​​​ ​Pavolia Reine...​ ​​

1072
00:34:34,756 --> 00:34:37,793
​​​ ​...and IRyS!​ ​​

1073
00:34:37,793 --> 00:34:40,562
​​​ ​Goodbye!​ ​​

1074
00:34:38,894 --> 00:34:41,696
​​​ ​Goodbye!​ ​​

1075
00:34:39,861 --> 00:34:42,564
​​​ ​Goodbye!​ ​​

1076
00:34:40,562 --> 00:34:42,564
​​​ ​Bye-bye!​ ​​

1077
00:34:41,696 --> 00:34:44,566

​​<i>​ ​Au revoir</i>!​ ​​

1080
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,569
​​<i>​ ​Au revoir, oui-oui</i>!​ ​​

1081
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,735
​​​ ​This is holo Bonjour, after all.​ ​​

1082
00:34:47,569 --> 00:34:48,837
​​<i>​ ​Au revoir</i>~!​ ​​

1083
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:50,038
​​<i>​ ​Au revoir</i>!​ ​​

1084
00:34:49,137 --> 00:34:54,643
​​​ ​Bye-bye!​ ​​
