in building this tree um so I was

296
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:03,000
in building this tree um so I was
 

297
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,790
in building this tree um so I was
thinking about it I

298
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:06,800
thinking about it I
 

299
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,949

think one thing you could do is get wool

300
00:09:11,949 --> 00:09:11,959
think one thing you could do is get wool
 

301
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:15,430
think one thing you could do is get wool
blocks from the wool Farms inside the

302
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:15,440
blocks from the wool Farms inside the
 

303
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,110
blocks from the wool Farms inside the
tree at the bottom and you can build

304
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:18,120
tree at the bottom and you can build
 

305
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,190
tree at the bottom and you can build
like a

306
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:20,200
like a
 

307
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,310
like a
scaffolding uh like Under The

308
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:23,320
scaffolding uh like Under The
 

309
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,150
scaffolding uh like Under The
Canopy uhhuh because we need to place

310
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,160
Canopy uhhuh because we need to place
 

311
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,550
Canopy uhhuh because we need to place
blocks underneath the tree and it's

312
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:28,560
blocks underneath the tree and it's
 

313
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,990
blocks underneath the tree and it's
easier to do so if there's like a

314
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:31,000
easier to do so if there's like a
 

315
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,470
easier to do so if there's like a
somewhere to stand do you mean
