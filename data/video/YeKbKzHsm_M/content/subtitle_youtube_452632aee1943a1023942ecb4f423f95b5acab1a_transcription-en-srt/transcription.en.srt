tail and eyes the the holes look like
 

2913
01:35:01,199 --> 01:35:03,550
tail and eyes the the holes look like
eyes and there was a tail animal brain

2914
01:35:03,550 --> 01:35:03,560
eyes and there was a tail animal brain
 

2915
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:07,870
eyes and there was a tail animal brain
then it's fine that brain and also some

2916
01:35:07,870 --> 01:35:07,880
then it's fine that brain and also some
 

2917
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:09,830
then it's fine that brain and also some
parts looked like ears but then some

2918
01:35:09,830 --> 01:35:09,840
parts looked like ears but then some
 

2919
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:11,229
parts looked like ears but then some
like from the others too and then they

01:35:11,229 --> 01:35:11,239
like from the others too and then they
 

2921
01:35:11,239 --> 01:35:12,709
like from the others too and then they
got rid of it and you also I feel like

2922
01:35:12,709 --> 01:35:12,719
got rid of it and you also I feel like
 

2923

maybe I should no no it's okay it's okay
don't worry I think you're doing well

2954
01:35:54,550 --> 01:35:54,560
don't worry I think you're doing well
 

2955
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:56,510
don't worry I think you're doing well
okay okay but think of what I what else

2956
01:35:56,510 --> 01:35:56,520
okay okay but think of what I what else
 

2957
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:57,790
okay okay but think of what I what else
I could think of and how you could

2958
01:35:57,790 --> 01:35:57,800
I could think of and how you could
 

2959
01:35:57,800 --> 01:35:59,870
I could think of and how you could
prevent me of thinking of those

2960
01:35:59,870 --> 01:35:59,880
prevent me of thinking of those
 

2961
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:04,390
prevent me of thinking of those
things that's

2962
01:36:04,390 --> 01:36:04,400

 

2963
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:09,350

so especially is you know

2964
01:36:09,350 --> 01:36:09,360
so especially is you know
 

2965
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:11,950
so especially is you know
yeah H like like if you give it Windows

2966
01:36:11,950 --> 01:36:11,960
yeah H like like if you give it Windows
 

2967
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:13,310
yeah H like like if you give it Windows
you know it looks like ice to me but

2968
01:36:13,310 --> 01:36:13,320
you know it looks like ice to me but
 

2969
01:36:13,320 --> 01:36:14,510
you know it looks like ice to me but
it's probably not going to be a car

2970
01:36:14,510 --> 01:36:14,520
it's probably not going to be a car
 

2971
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:17,070
it's probably not going to be a car
again so we'll see we'll see yeah

2972
01:36:17,070 --> 01:36:17,080
again so we'll see we'll see yeah
 

2973
01:36:17,080 --> 01:36:19,990
again so we'll see we'll see yeah
because there's not enough blocks to

2974
01:36:19,990 --> 01:36:20,000
because there's not enough blocks to
 

2975
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:23,229
because there's not enough blocks to
differentiate I I'll read again ah now I

2976
01:36:23,229 --> 01:36:23,239
differentiate I I'll read again ah now I
 

2977
01:36:23,239 --> 01:36:25,550
differentiate I I'll read again ah now I
see they were building like upwards

2978
01:36:25,550 --> 01:36:25,560
see they were building like upwards
 

2979
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:26,550
see they were building like upwards
maybe because they wanted to do

2980
01:36:26,550 --> 01:36:26,560
maybe because they wanted to do
 

2981
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:29,030
maybe because they wanted to do
threedimensional like an actual car but

2982
01:36:29,030 --> 01:36:29,040
threedimensional like an actual car but
 

2983
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:30,629
threedimensional like an actual car but
that would that one minute one minute as

2984
01:36:30,629 --> 01:36:30,639
that would that one minute one minute as
 

2985
01:36:30,639 --> 01:36:33,590
that would that one minute one minute as
we now know is way too little not as

2986
01:36:33,590 --> 01:36:33,600
we now know is way too little not as
 

2987
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:36,709
we now know is way too little not as
long as we thought

2988
01:36:36,709 --> 01:36:36,719

 

2989
01:36:36,719 --> 01:36:40,470

so she shears I

2990
01:36:40,470 --> 01:36:40,480
so she shears I
 

2991
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:44,350
so she shears I
will I might try build yeah but but but

2992
01:36:44,350 --> 01:36:44,360
will I might try build yeah but but but
 

2993
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:46,590
will I might try build yeah but but but
you know how how short the one minute

2994
01:36:46,590 --> 01:36:46,600
you know how how short the one minute
 

2995
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:48,550
you know how how short the one minute
just was I don't know if you can build

2996
01:36:48,550 --> 01:36:48,560
just was I don't know if you can build
 

2997
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:50,669
just was I don't know if you can build
three dimensional like at least you can

2998
01:36:50,669 --> 01:36:50,679
three dimensional like at least you can
 

2999
01:36:50,679 --> 01:36:52,830
three dimensional like at least you can
build flat threedimensional but not like

3000
01:36:52,830 --> 01:36:52,840
build flat threedimensional but not like
 

3001
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:55,229
build flat threedimensional but not like
three three

3002
01:36:55,229 --> 01:36:55,239
three three
 

3003
01:36:55,239 --> 01:37:01,669
three three
3D you know what I mean oh what the

3004
01:37:01,669 --> 01:37:01,679

should ask if crouching is allowed

4128
02:07:51,549 --> 02:07:51,559
should ask if crouching is allowed
 

4129
02:07:51,559 --> 02:07:54,189
should ask if crouching is allowed
because what if some people do it uh to

4130
02:07:54,189 --> 02:07:54,199
because what if some people do it uh to
 

4131

4132
02:07:56,669 --> 02:07:56,679
not fall down you guys need to uh and
 

4133
02:07:56,679 --> 02:07:57,870
not fall down you guys need to uh and
then I don't do it because I think it's

4134
02:07:57,870 --> 02:07:57,880
then I don't do it because I think it's
 

4135
02:07:57,880 --> 02:07:59,709
then I don't do it because I think it's
not allowed you know but then some

4136
02:07:59,709 --> 02:07:59,719
not allowed you know but then some
 

4137
02:07:59,719 --> 02:08:01,750
not allowed you know but then some
people do it and then it's like oh

4138
02:08:01,750 --> 02:08:01,760
people do it and then it's like oh
 

4139
02:08:01,760 --> 02:08:04,830
people do it and then it's like oh
because nobody asked about it so it's

4140
02:08:04,830 --> 02:08:04,840
because nobody asked about it so it's
 

4141
02:08:04,840 --> 02:08:07,790
because nobody asked about it so it's
okay like should I ask at least cuz if

4142
02:08:07,790 --> 02:08:07,800
okay like should I ask at least cuz if
 

4143
02:08:07,800 --> 02:08:10,030

you crouch you can't fall down the hole

4144
02:08:10,030 --> 02:08:10,040
you crouch you can't fall down the hole
 

4145
02:08:10,040 --> 02:08:11,270
you crouch you can't fall down the hole
but generally I feel like you want to be

4146
02:08:11,270 --> 02:08:11,280
but generally I feel like you want to be
 

4147
02:08:11,280 --> 02:08:12,709
but generally I feel like you want to be
faster anyway so if you crouch you're

4148
02:08:12,709 --> 02:08:12,719
faster anyway so if you crouch you're
 

4149
02:08:12,719 --> 02:08:17,149
faster anyway so if you crouch you're
not fast enough to fill

4150
02:08:17,149 --> 02:08:17,159

blue yeah KOB and then way I know I know
 

5183
02:40:48,479 --> 02:40:50,309
blue yeah KOB and then way I know I know
the order okay okay and then there's

5184
02:40:50,309 --> 02:40:50,319

lime green right is that green yeah lime
green that's E's color so it's basically

5188
02:40:56,190 --> 02:40:56,200
green that's E's color so it's basically
 

5189
02:40:56,200 --> 02:40:58,670
green that's E's color so it's basically
uh on the left it's ARA 15 on the middle

5190
02:40:58,670 --> 02:40:58,680
uh on the left it's ARA 15 on the middle
 

5191
02:40:58,680 --> 02:41:00,630
uh on the left it's ARA 15 on the middle
is Holo but the thing is if you go over
