1
00:00:08,632 --> 00:00:10,632
This fever's got no fall

2
00:00:10,632 --> 00:00:12,551
Temperatures crazy off the wall

3
00:00:12,551 --> 00:00:14,551
Get ready like stop, drop, roll

4
00:00:14,551 --> 00:00:16,551
Not gonna break a sweat at all

5
00:00:16,709 --> 00:00:19,420
Sparks light that candle fire

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,334
The phoenix rises higher

7
00:00:24,874 --> 00:00:27,894
Frigid, frozen, no limits

8
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:32,000
Deadly cold, 10 below

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,066
支配したいよ 君の心を 
(I just wanna rule your heart)

10
00:00:38,066 --> 00:00:38,566
「いい子」？

11
00:00:38,566 --> 00:00:39,066
「僕の」？ 

12
00:00:39,066 --> 00:00:39,566
No more!

13
00:00:39,797 --> 00:00:41,834
Fire it up, fire it up now

14
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:43,527
Hot passion, never back down

15
00:00:43,527 --> 00:00:45,527
Freeze you out, freeze you out now 

16
00:00:45,527 --> 00:00:47,410
Not about to bend to you

17
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:49,481
Fire and ice, death and life, now

18
00:00:49,481 --> 00:00:51,100
High pressure, turn it up loud 

19
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,231
Fire and ice, fire and ice, now

20
00:00:53,231 --> 00:00:55,035
This world's all smoke and mirrors

21
00:00:57,069 --> 00:00:58,932

Blazing, unchanging 

26
00:01:12,231 --> 00:01:15,394
No strange thing about this heat, witness me

27
00:01:15,394 --> 00:01:17,394
Hit this beat, rinse repeat

28
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:20,671
These feelings got me freezing up

29
00:01:21,528 --> 00:01:24,093

身体中、いま かけ巡らせば 
(If you just let it run all over your being)

31
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:32,762
Can't control, overflow

32

つかまえたいの！君の心を

00:01:39,435 --> 00:01:39,965
「だって」？ 
("Because..."?)

35
00:01:39,965 --> 00:01:40,718
No more!

36
00:01:40,718 --> 00:01:42,718
Fire it up, fire it up now

37
00:01:42,718 --> 00:01:44,533
Hot passion, never back down

38
00:01:44,533 --> 00:01:46,533
Freeze you out, freeze you out now 

39
00:01:46,533 --> 00:01:48,237
Not about to bend to you

40
00:01:48,237 --> 00:01:50,237
Fire and ice, death and life, now

41
00:01:50,237 --> 00:01:52,222
High pressure, turn it up loud 

42
00:01:52,222 --> 00:01:54,222
Fire and ice, fire and ice, now

43
00:01:54,222 --> 00:01:56,043

込めて込めて 
(With all my heart...)

48
00:02:10,757 --> 00:02:12,791
We’re caught up in the eye of a storm of flame

49
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:14,791
It’s not complicated, but a nuanced game

50
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:16,757
A past you once gave me something I can’t shake

51
00:02:16,757 --> 00:02:18,500
The chance knowing somebody who had moves to make

52
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,500
So what’cha waiting for? You gotta burn it up

53
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,304
Cuz when it rains it pours, ya gotta earn the love

54
00:02:22,304 --> 00:02:23,228
I’m never given in

55
00:02:23,228 --> 00:02:24,186
They’ll never get enough 

56
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:25,708
Cuz you and I always rise above

57
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:26,316
You got it?

58
00:02:26,316 --> 00:02:28,378
Fire it up, fire it up now

59
00:02:28,378 --> 00:02:30,276
Hot passion, never back down

60
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:32,276
Freeze you out, freeze you out now 

61

62
00:02:34,057 --> 00:02:35,957
Fire and ice, death and life, now

63
00:02:35,957 --> 00:02:37,866
High pressure, turn it up loud 

64
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,834
Fire and ice, fire and ice, now

65
00:02:39,834 --> 00:02:41,751
