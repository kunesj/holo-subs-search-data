if the cube lands over there

6152
02:39:15,750 --> 02:39:15,760
if the cube lands over there
 

6153
02:39:15,760 --> 02:39:17,670
if the cube lands over there
maybe it will reflect everything and

6154
02:39:17,670 --> 02:39:17,680
maybe it will reflect everything and
 

6155
02:39:17,680 --> 02:39:20,630

and see what changes when i put the cube
 

7723
03:19:45,600 --> 03:19:48,070
and see what changes when i put the cube
uh onto the laser

7724
03:19:48,070 --> 03:19:48,080
uh onto the laser
 

7725
03:19:48,080 --> 03:19:51,110
uh onto the laser
okay

to run over to the other side
 

7733
03:19:57,439 --> 03:20:00,469
to run over to the other side
and number two no number two

7734
03:20:00,469 --> 03:20:00,479
and number two no number two
 

7735
03:20:00,479 --> 03:20:01,349

i see okay look at that
i put the airflow

8100
03:28:32,710 --> 03:28:32,720
i put the airflow
 

8101
03:28:32,720 --> 03:28:35,349
i put the airflow
through now but no so

8102
03:28:35,349 --> 03:28:35,359
through now but no so
 

8103
03:28:35,359 --> 03:28:37,590
through now but no so
if you

8104
03:28:37,590 --> 03:28:37,600
