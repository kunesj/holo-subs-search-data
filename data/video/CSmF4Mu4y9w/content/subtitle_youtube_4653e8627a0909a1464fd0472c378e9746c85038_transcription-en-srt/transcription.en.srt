627
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:41,909
that can we pick it up we could take it
to the water I think the one thing I

628
00:18:41,909 --> 00:18:41,919
to the water I think the one thing I
 

629
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,710
to the water I think the one thing I
remember is that it's really important

630
