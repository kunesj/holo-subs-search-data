i would understand the logic that like
 

4149
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:31,510
i would understand the logic that like
for example if you go

4150

01:22:42,159 --> 01:22:43,990
anyway and like what's the meaning
behind wearing panties there i guess but

4164
01:22:43,990 --> 01:22:44,000

side of the road because otherwise
 

5561
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:49,189
side of the road because otherwise
if if the roads weren't wide enough you

5562
01:52:49,189 --> 01:52:49,199
if if the roads weren't wide enough you
 

5563
01:52:49,199 --> 01:52:50,550
if if the roads weren't wide enough you
just have only mountains and you
