1415
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:06,109
New
York so cool so cool and so one thing I

1416
00:40:06,109 --> 00:40:06,119
York so cool so cool and so one thing I
 

1417
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:09,030
York so cool so cool and so one thing I
want to say uh if you look up the

1418
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:09,040
want to say uh if you look up the
 

1419
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,190
want to say uh if you look up the
location then yeah it might be a little

1420
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:11,200
location then yeah it might be a little
 

1421
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,030
location then yeah it might be a little
bit shocking at first that um the

1422
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:15,040
bit shocking at first that um the
 

1423
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,750
bit shocking at first that um the
capacity is pretty low like half of what

1424
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:18,760
capacity is pretty low like half of what
 

1425
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,910
capacity is pretty low like half of what
we had before I think but uh keep in

1426
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:21,920
we had before I think but uh keep in
 

1427
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,510
we had before I think but uh keep in
mind that this time we actually have two

1428
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:25,520
mind that this time we actually have two
 

1429
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,870
mind that this time we actually have two
days two days

1430
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:28,880
days two days
 

1431
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,430
days two days
instead of one day only and that is

1432
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:32,440
instead of one day only and that is
 

1433
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:36,030
instead of one day only and that is
super hype so it's basically double the

1434
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:36,040
super hype so it's basically double the
 

1435
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,550
super hype so it's basically double the
capacity but at the same time I know

1436
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:37,560
capacity but at the same time I know
 

1437
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,550
capacity but at the same time I know
that's not quite true either because

1438
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:39,560
that's not quite true either because
 

1439
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,430
that's not quite true either because
some people will probably go on both

1440
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:42,440
some people will probably go on both
 

1441
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,390
some people will probably go on both
days and then that's not really doubling

1442
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:45,400
days and then that's not really doubling
 

1443
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,829
days and then that's not really doubling
the

1444
00:40:46,829 --> 00:40:46,839
the
 

1445
00:40:46,839 --> 00:40:48,950
the
capacity um but at least you have you

1446
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:48,960
capacity um but at least you have you
 

1447
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,109
capacity um but at least you have you
know you do have the chance

1448
00:40:52,109 --> 00:40:52,119
know you do have the chance
 

1449
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:55,309
know you do have the chance
approximately the same chance I would

1450
00:40:55,309 --> 00:40:55,319
approximately the same chance I would
 

1451
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:58,710
approximately the same chance I would
say hello for percentage wise of getting

1452
00:40:58,710 --> 00:40:58,720
say hello for percentage wise of getting
 

1453
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,750
say hello for percentage wise of getting
a ticket as last year I don't know I

1454
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:00,760
a ticket as last year I don't know I
 

1455
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,829
a ticket as last year I don't know I
mean I guess not because maybe now more

1456
00:41:02,829 --> 00:41:02,839
mean I guess not because maybe now more
 

1457
00:41:02,839 --> 00:41:04,069
mean I guess not because maybe now more
people are actually trying to get a

1458
00:41:04,069 --> 00:41:04,079
people are actually trying to get a
 

1459
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:05,589
people are actually trying to get a
ticket than last

1460
00:41:05,589 --> 00:41:05,599
ticket than last
 

1461
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:08,390
ticket than last
year I don't know but yeah of course you

1462
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:08,400
year I don't know but yeah of course you
 

1463
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,710
year I don't know but yeah of course you
can always

1464
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:09,720
can always
 

1465
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:13,470
can always
stream and the cool thing I I guess I'll

1466
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:13,480
stream and the cool thing I I guess I'll
 

1467
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,710

too I I I I decided you know since the

13378
05:57:21,190 --> 05:57:21,200
too I I I I decided you know since the
 

13379
05:57:21,200 --> 05:57:24,110
too I I I I decided you know since the
stream is so so late in the day I'll

13380
05:57:24,110 --> 05:57:24,120
stream is so so late in the day I'll
 

13381
05:57:24,120 --> 05:57:25,670
stream is so so late in the day I'll
just

13382
05:57:25,670 --> 05:57:25,680
just
 

13383
05:57:25,680 --> 05:57:28,350
just
uh think all about it and plan it all

13384
05:57:28,350 --> 05:57:28,360
uh think all about it and plan it all

I don't know I don't
know it's just everything's delayed my

13414
05:58:13,230 --> 05:58:13,240
know it's just everything's delayed my
 

13415
05:58:13,240 --> 05:58:15,990
know it's just everything's delayed my
2023 outfit was the one from 2022 and my

13416
05:58:15,990 --> 05:58:16,000
2023 outfit was the one from 2022 and my
 

13417
05:58:16,000 --> 05:58:19,948
2023 outfit was the one from 2022 and my
2024 outfit is the one from oh 2023

13418

13419
05:58:19,958 --> 05:58:21,510
2024 outfit is the one from oh 2023
so

13420
05:58:21,510 --> 05:58:21,520
so
 

13421
05:58:21,520 --> 05:58:27,190
so
yeah I could have planned them

13422
05:58:27,190 --> 05:58:27,200

 

13423
05:58:27,200 --> 05:58:31,708

somewhat parallel is at the same time

13424
05:58:31,708 --> 05:58:31,718
somewhat parallel is at the same time
 

13425
05:58:31,718 --> 05:58:33,788
somewhat parallel is at the same time
but and I wanted I was going to do that

13426
05:58:33,788 --> 05:58:33,798
but and I wanted I was going to do that
 

13427
05:58:33,798 --> 05:58:36,430
but and I wanted I was going to do that
but then I was like you know thinking

13428
05:58:36,430 --> 05:58:36,440
but then I was like you know thinking
 

13429
05:58:36,440 --> 05:58:38,150
but then I was like you know thinking
about if I can

13430
05:58:38,150 --> 05:58:38,160
about if I can
 

13431
05:58:38,160 --> 05:58:42,628
about if I can
maybe use this slot for something else

13432
05:58:42,628 --> 05:58:42,638
maybe use this slot for something else
 

13433
05:58:42,638 --> 05:58:43,590
maybe use this slot for something else
you

13434
05:58:43,590 --> 05:58:43,600
you
 

13435
05:58:43,600 --> 05:58:47,030
you
know and that's why I've been

13436
05:58:47,030 --> 05:58:47,040
know and that's why I've been
 

13437
05:58:47,040 --> 05:58:51,070
know and that's why I've been
holding uh on to it and

13438
05:58:51,070 --> 05:58:51,080
holding uh on to it and
 

13439
05:58:51,080 --> 05:58:57,948
holding uh on to it and
waiting

13440
05:58:57,948 --> 05:58:57,958

 

13441
05:58:57,958 --> 05:59:00,750
