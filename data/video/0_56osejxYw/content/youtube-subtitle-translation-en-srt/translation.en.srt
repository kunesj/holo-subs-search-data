00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:56,700
I eee want to learn how to make weapons,
 

750
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,330
I eee want to learn how to make weapons,

753
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:02,760
comedian. Well, so I'm not a
 

754
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,510
comedian. Well, so I'm not a
comedian anymore, but I became a

755
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:05,520
comedian anymore, but I became a
 

756
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,310

00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:16,140
doing now.  but forgetting what's
 

764
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,950

past is

765
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:18,960
past is
 

766
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,470

you immediately forget everything

773
00:33:28,009 --> 00:33:28,019
you immediately forget everything
 

774
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:29,269
you immediately forget everything
that happened here, so you can't

775
00:33:29,269 --> 00:33:29,279
that happened here, so you can't
 

776
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,490
that happened here, so you can't
tell it to other people, that's good, I

777
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:31,500
tell it to other people, that's good, I
 

778
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:36,730
tell it to other people, that's good, I
like that, that

779
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:36,740
