one I can hit the
 

5833
02:41:47,040 --> 02:41:49,670
one I can hit the
algorithm in a good way again I feel

5834
02:41:49,670 --> 02:41:49,680
algorithm in a good way again I feel
 

5835
02:41:49,680 --> 02:41:54,030

schedule uh although now it would be
 

11637
05:30:23,280 --> 05:30:24,470

more

11638
05:30:24,470 --> 05:30:24,480
more
 

11639
05:30:24,480 --> 05:30:27,830
more
like recent now so it would make more

11640
05:30:27,830 --> 05:30:27,840
like recent now so it would make more
 

11641
05:30:27,840 --> 05:30:29,470
