785
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:26,590
I forgot how to do that because that's
not really something I usually do

786
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:26,600

 

787
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:32,570

00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:59,270
um
what if I do this

798
00:22:59,270 --> 00:22:59,280

 

799
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,950

in any case

800
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:00,960
in any case
 

801
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,630
in any case
I don't think a different capture would

802
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:02,640
I don't think a different capture would
 

803
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:09,529
I don't think a different capture would
work

804
00:23:09,529 --> 00:23:09,539

 

805
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:13,070

let's just play with that audio

806
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:13,080

 

807
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,830

also

808
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:15,840
also
 

809
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,250
also
okay no I don't like that though I don't

810
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:19,260
okay no I don't like that though I don't
 

811
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:26,690
okay no I don't like that though I don't
like that

812
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:26,700

 

813
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:37,610

no I don't wanna

814
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:37,620

 

815
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:41,210

I think I might have to do

816
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:41,220
I think I might have to do
 

817
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:48,049
I think I might have to do
with me using an extra screen or so

818
00:23:48,049 --> 00:23:48,059

 

819
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,630

Maybe

820
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:50,640
Maybe
 

821
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,390
Maybe
and then the audio kind of weirdly going

822
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:53,400
and then the audio kind of weirdly going
 

823
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,950
and then the audio kind of weirdly going
through that

824
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:54,960
through that
 

825
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,350
through that
could that be let me try to disconnect

826
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:57,360
could that be let me try to disconnect
 

827
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,490
could that be let me try to disconnect
it

828
00:23:58,490 --> 00:23:58,500
it
 

829
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,870
it
could that be

830
00:23:59,870 --> 00:23:59,880
could that be
 

831
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,850
could that be
yeah because the extra screen screen

832
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:01,860
yeah because the extra screen screen
 

833
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,649
yeah because the extra screen screen
does have speakers

834
00:24:03,649 --> 00:24:03,659
does have speakers
 

835
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:08,029
does have speakers
let me unplug it wait wait um

836
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:08,039

 

837
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:10,690

oh

838
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:10,700

844
00:24:18,289 --> 00:24:18,299
worth it
 

845
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:20,630
worth it
if the audio

846
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:20,640
