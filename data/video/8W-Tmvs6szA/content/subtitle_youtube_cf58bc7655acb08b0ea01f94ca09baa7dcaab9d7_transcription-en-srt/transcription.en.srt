we have to keep trying this is the

948
00:24:56,149 --> 00:24:56,159
we have to keep trying this is the
 

949
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,370
we have to keep trying this is the
Rubik's Cube stream apparently there's a

950
00:24:58,370 --> 00:24:58,380
Rubik's Cube stream apparently there's a
 

951
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,690
Rubik's Cube stream apparently there's a
technique Galley and I think the only

952
00:24:59,690 --> 00:24:59,700
technique Galley and I think the only
 

953
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,370
technique Galley and I think the only
way we will solve this is by knowing the

954
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:01,380
way we will solve this is by knowing the
 

955
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,330
way we will solve this is by knowing the

solve the Rubik's Cube ah there are many

994
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:49,080
solve the Rubik's Cube ah there are many
 

995
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,649
solve the Rubik's Cube ah there are many
approaches well across there's the white

996
00:25:51,649 --> 00:25:51,659
approaches well across there's the white
 

997
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:53,630
approaches well across there's the white
cross White Corners

998
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:53,640
cross White Corners
 

999
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,190
cross White Corners
you can read the basic cubing

1000
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:55,200
you can read the basic cubing
 

1001
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,750
you can read the basic cubing
terminology and you will need to know

1002
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:56,760
terminology and you will need to know
 

1003
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,029
terminology and you will need to know
the Rubik's Cube notation what the

1004
00:25:59,029 --> 00:25:59,039
the Rubik's Cube notation what the
 

1005
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,610
the Rubik's Cube notation what the
letters mean and the algorithms what do

I don't understand anything White Cross

1010
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:08,220
I don't understand anything White Cross
 

1011
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,649
I don't understand anything White Cross
like

1012
00:26:09,649 --> 00:26:09,659
like
 

1013
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:13,310
like
wait you can move some things around

1014
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:13,320

1018
00:26:16,789 --> 00:26:16,799
right cross
 

1019
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:17,810
right cross
okay

1020
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:17,820
okay
 

1021
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,430
okay
let's figure out though I'm gonna do a

1022
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:19,440
let's figure out though I'm gonna do a
 

1023
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,169
let's figure out though I'm gonna do a
white cross

1024
00:26:21,169 --> 00:26:21,179
white cross
 

1025
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:23,990
white cross
with the middle also white or the middle

1026
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:24,000
with the middle also white or the middle
 

1027
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,330
with the middle also white or the middle
being something else

1028
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:26,340
being something else
 

1029
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,330
being something else
um

1030
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:28,340
um
 

1031
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:31,549
um
how do you doing the word Chris

1032
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:31,559
how do you doing the word Chris
 

1033
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:36,409
how do you doing the word Chris
um let's see you're gonna need to

1034
00:26:36,409 --> 00:26:36,419

 

1035
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:39,529

I think I almost got it

1036
00:26:39,529 --> 00:26:39,539
I think I almost got it
 

1037
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:40,750
I think I almost got it
so

1038
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:40,760
so
 

1039
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:44,510
so
I will never solve this no no no it'll

1040
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:44,520
I will never solve this no no no it'll
 

1041
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,830
I will never solve this no no no it'll
be fine now that I'm doing this

1042
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:45,840
be fine now that I'm doing this

well what which side which part of the
 

1049
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:54,230
well what which side which part of the
brain does this need what am I lacking

1811
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:17,950
[Music]
it rotate across

1812
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:17,960

 

1813
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:20,650

I understand

1814
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:20,660
I understand
 

1815
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:23,270
I understand
rotate the entire white crosses at the

1816
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:23,280
rotate the entire white crosses at the
 

1817
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,490
rotate the entire white crosses at the
sides of each cross

1818
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:25,500
sides of each cross
 

1819
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:29,809
sides of each cross
match with the center colors

1820
00:44:29,809 --> 00:44:29,819

 

1821
00:44:29,819 --> 00:44:32,150

oh yeah so like

1822
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:32,160
oh yeah so like
 

1823
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,390
oh yeah so like
these colors all being the same ah these

1824
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:35,400
these colors all being the same ah these
 

1825
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,089
these colors all being the same ah these
colors all being ah these colors okay

1826
00:44:38,089 --> 00:44:38,099
colors all being ah these colors okay
 

1827
00:44:38,099 --> 00:44:40,910
colors all being ah these colors okay
and let me undo what I just did where is

1828
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:40,920
and let me undo what I just did where is
 

1829
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:44,150
and let me undo what I just did where is
where is it it's gone

1830
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:44,160

 

1831
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,150

just retrace your steps

1832
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:47,160
just retrace your steps
 

1833
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,089
just retrace your steps
your trash your steps

1834
00:44:49,089 --> 00:44:49,099
your trash your steps
 

1835
00:44:49,099 --> 00:44:51,650

ah it's never too late Kiowa

1838
00:44:56,329 --> 00:44:56,339
ah it's never too late Kiowa
 

1839
00:44:56,339 --> 00:45:00,290
ah it's never too late Kiowa
it's never too so I have nope it's never

1840
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:00,300
it's never too so I have nope it's never
 

1841

1843
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:04,849

probably need to stop being afraid to

1844
00:45:04,849 --> 00:45:04,859
probably need to stop being afraid to
 

1845
00:45:04,859 --> 00:45:06,470
probably need to stop being afraid to
dissolve the cross I just [\h__\h]

1846
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:06,480
dissolve the cross I just [\h__\h]
 

1847
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:11,410
dissolve the cross I just [\h__\h]
everything up oh you see

1848
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:11,420

 

1849
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:18,470

my orange is gone now it's back

1850
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:18,480

 

1851
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,510

Cal is not the expert her it's her first

1852
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:20,520
Cal is not the expert her it's her first
 

1853
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,490
Cal is not the expert her it's her first
time too but she's doing pretty well I'm

1854
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:22,500
time too but she's doing pretty well I'm
 

1855
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,230
time too but she's doing pretty well I'm
definitely not the expert she's she's

1856
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:24,240
definitely not the expert she's she's
 

1857
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,990
definitely not the expert she's she's
more like open to comprehending this

1858
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:27,000
more like open to comprehending this
 

1859
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,750
more like open to comprehending this
when my brain has already shut down

1860
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:31,760

 

1861
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:35,950

to figure out the way but

1862
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:35,960
to figure out the way but
 

1863
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,270
to figure out the way but
apparently the White Corners come later

1864
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:38,280
apparently the White Corners come later
 

1865
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,609
apparently the White Corners come later
so don't get too caught up on them now

1866
00:45:40,609 --> 00:45:40,619
so don't get too caught up on them now
 

1867
00:45:40,619 --> 00:45:43,190
so don't get too caught up on them now
but like maybe I'll try and focus on

1868
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:43,200
but like maybe I'll try and focus on
 

1869
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,950
but like maybe I'll try and focus on
getting this one to be green

1870
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:45,960
getting this one to be green
 

1871
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,809
getting this one to be green

1872
00:45:47,809 --> 00:45:47,819
pleasure to Anchor the white piece to
 

1873
00:45:47,819 --> 00:45:48,650
pleasure to Anchor the white piece to
the bottom

1874
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:48,660

there it is it's the bottom so

1878
00:45:57,550 --> 00:45:57,560
there it is it's the bottom so
 

1879
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:01,630
there it is it's the bottom so
orange I think my white cross is gone

orange I think my white cross is gone
 

1881
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:06,950
orange I think my white cross is gone
I need to not be afraid of losing it

1882
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:06,960

 

1883
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,450

it's too late for me already

1888
00:46:13,849 --> 00:46:13,859
it's too late for me already
 

1889
00:46:13,859 --> 00:46:14,930
it's too late for me already
it's fine

1890
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:14,940
it's fine
 

1891
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:16,670
it's fine
look I feel like you're getting closer

1892
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:16,680
look I feel like you're getting closer
 

1893
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:20,950
look I feel like you're getting closer
no I'm not I'm sure you are

1894
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:20,960

 

1895
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,650

yeah but that's only the first part I'm

1896
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:24,660
yeah but that's only the first part I'm
 

1897
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:29,089
yeah but that's only the first part I'm
just solving mine completely

1898
00:46:29,089 --> 00:46:29,099

 

1899
00:46:29,099 --> 00:46:30,890

I wonder if there's a video tutorial

1900
00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:30,900
I wonder if there's a video tutorial
 

1901
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:34,670
I wonder if there's a video tutorial
there's surely a million like people who

1902
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:34,680
there's surely a million like people who
 

1903
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:37,790
there's surely a million like people who
want to flex how fast they solve their

1904
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:37,800
want to flex how fast they solve their

just gotta know the algorithm algorithm

1908
00:46:44,270 --> 00:46:44,280
just gotta know the algorithm algorithm
 

1909
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,430
just gotta know the algorithm algorithm
if you know the algorithm you can solve

1910
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:46,440
if you know the algorithm you can solve
 

1911
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:47,450
if you know the algorithm you can solve
it

1912
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:47,460
it
 

1913
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:51,530
it
honestly I just don't know who algorithm

1914
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:51,540
honestly I just don't know who algorithm
 

1915
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,150
honestly I just don't know who algorithm
is

1916
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:53,160
is
 

1917
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:58,069
is
who is algorithm

these was so meaningless because we just

1922
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:03,420
these was so meaningless because we just
 

1923
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:04,970
these was so meaningless because we just
we just thought yeah that's what I

1924
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:04,980
we just thought yeah that's what I
 

1925
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:07,190
we just thought yeah that's what I
thought because we're it's in we're

1926
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:07,200
thought because we're it's in we're
 

1927
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,950
thought because we're it's in we're
brought of the camera we're too focused

1928
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:09,960
brought of the camera we're too focused
 

1929
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,050
brought of the camera we're too focused
on on the cube

1930
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:12,060
on on the cube
 

1931
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:14,329
on on the cube
on the cube it's really low FPS

1932
00:47:14,329 --> 00:47:14,339
on the cube it's really low FPS
 

1933
00:47:14,339 --> 00:47:17,150
on the cube it's really low FPS
apparently too yeah really oh well no we

1934
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:17,160
apparently too yeah really oh well no we
 

1935
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,770
apparently too yeah really oh well no we
don't need it

1936
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:18,780
don't need it
 

1937
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:20,990
don't need it
um you guys should be focusing on this

1938
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:21,000
um you guys should be focusing on this
 

1939
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,150
um you guys should be focusing on this
too to help us yeah don't look at our

1940
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:23,160
too to help us yeah don't look at our
 

1941
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,849
too to help us yeah don't look at our
faces if we were in um

1942
00:47:25,849 --> 00:47:25,859
faces if we were in um
 

1943
00:47:25,859 --> 00:47:28,130
faces if we were in um
okay once you have set before you turn

1944
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:28,140
okay once you have set before you turn
 

1945
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:30,530
okay once you have set before you turn
anything then turn it oh stream offline

1946
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:30,540
anything then turn it oh stream offline
 

1947
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:32,809
anything then turn it oh stream offline
all right it's back okay you need to

1948
00:47:32,809 --> 00:47:32,819
all right it's back okay you need to
 

1949
00:47:32,819 --> 00:47:35,450
all right it's back okay you need to
move the ones you have set before you

1950
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:35,460
move the ones you have set before you
 

1951
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:38,030
move the ones you have set before you
turn anything then turn it back see all

1952
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:38,040
turn anything then turn it back see all
 

1953
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,970
turn anything then turn it back see all
this makes no sense to me and you say in

1954
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:40,980
this makes no sense to me and you say in
 

1955
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:43,010
this makes no sense to me and you say in
words and I'm just like oh funny words

only getting worse because I lost my
 

2977
01:08:48,359 --> 01:08:49,870
only getting worse because I lost my
crust and I've been yeah

01:08:52,729 --> 01:08:52,739
I've been trying to get the cross back
 

2981
01:08:52,739 --> 01:08:55,570
I've been trying to get the cross back
foreign

2982
01:08:55,570 --> 01:08:55,580

 

2983
01:08:55,580 --> 01:09:00,349

I was doing very well and now yeah it's

2984
01:09:00,349 --> 01:09:00,359
I was doing very well and now yeah it's
 

2985
01:09:00,359 --> 01:09:03,349
I was doing very well and now yeah it's
just ass it's just [\h__\h] hold on wait a

2986
01:09:03,349 --> 01:09:03,359
just ass it's just [\h__\h] hold on wait a
 

2987
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:05,809
just ass it's just [\h__\h] hold on wait a
minute wait I just don't I think my

2988
01:09:05,809 --> 01:09:05,819
minute wait I just don't I think my
 

2989
01:09:05,819 --> 01:09:07,550
minute wait I just don't I think my
problem is that I don't believe in it

2990
01:09:07,550 --> 01:09:07,560
problem is that I don't believe in it
 

2991
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,470
problem is that I don't believe in it
ever happening I just don't believe in

2992
01:09:09,470 --> 01:09:09,480
ever happening I just don't believe in
 

2993
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:11,269
ever happening I just don't believe in
it you have to believe though that's the

2994
01:09:11,269 --> 01:09:11,279
it you have to believe though that's the
 

2995
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:13,910
it you have to believe though that's the
only way that you can do it maybe this

2996
01:09:13,910 --> 01:09:13,920
only way that you can do it maybe this
 

2997
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:18,669
only way that you can do it maybe this
is

2998
01:09:18,669 --> 01:09:18,679

 

2999
01:09:18,679 --> 01:09:24,769

wait I guess it's probably a looping

3000
01:09:24,769 --> 01:09:24,779

 

3001
01:09:24,779 --> 01:09:28,370

I mean it says the dying and an a dying

3002
01:09:28,370 --> 01:09:28,380
I mean it says the dying and an a dying
 

3003
01:09:28,380 --> 01:09:32,590
I mean it says the dying and an a dying
in SCA

3004
01:09:32,590 --> 01:09:32,600

 

3005
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,870

yeah now it's

3006
01:09:34,870 --> 01:09:34,880
yeah now it's
 

3007
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:38,329
yeah now it's
pretty much for everybody and you

3008
01:09:38,329 --> 01:09:38,339
pretty much for everybody and you
 

3009
01:09:38,339 --> 01:09:40,610
pretty much for everybody and you
I mean time Loop there's not much you

3010
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:40,620
I mean time Loop there's not much you
 

3011
01:09:40,620 --> 01:09:43,010
I mean time Loop there's not much you
can do right I mean I'm looking at OBS

3012
01:09:43,010 --> 01:09:43,020
can do right I mean I'm looking at OBS
 

3013
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:44,870
can do right I mean I'm looking at OBS
and it says that it's perfect excellent

3014
01:09:44,870 --> 01:09:44,880
and it says that it's perfect excellent
 

3015
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,849
and it says that it's perfect excellent

3017
01:09:46,859 --> 01:09:48,650

okay

3018
01:09:48,650 --> 01:09:48,660
okay
 

3019
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:50,570
okay
we're just gonna wait recently YouTube

3020
01:09:50,570 --> 01:09:50,580
we're just gonna wait recently YouTube
 

3021
01:09:50,580 --> 01:09:53,030
we're just gonna wait recently YouTube
has been worse than normal it's been

3022
01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:53,040

worse
yeah it's not getting better

3026
01:09:56,630 --> 01:09:56,640
yeah it's not getting better
 

3027
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:59,570
yeah it's not getting better
just like my Rubik's Cube just like my

3028
01:09:59,570 --> 01:09:59,580
just like my Rubik's Cube just like my
 

3029
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:02,270
just like my Rubik's Cube just like my
Rubik's Cube it's just not getting

3030
01:10:02,270 --> 01:10:02,280
Rubik's Cube it's just not getting
 

3031
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:04,430
Rubik's Cube it's just not getting
better it's just not coming together

3032
01:10:04,430 --> 01:10:04,440
better it's just not coming together
 

3033
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:07,790
better it's just not coming together
maybe life is like a Rubik's Cube whoa

3034
01:10:07,790 --> 01:10:07,800
maybe life is like a Rubik's Cube whoa
 

3035
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:10,610
maybe life is like a Rubik's Cube whoa
the pieces are never perfect but

3036
01:10:10,610 --> 01:10:10,620
the pieces are never perfect but
 

3037
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:12,950
the pieces are never perfect but
sometimes there's enough colors like in

3038
01:10:12,950 --> 01:10:12,960
sometimes there's enough colors like in
 

3039
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:15,110
sometimes there's enough colors like in
one area to be satisfying

3040
01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:15,120
one area to be satisfying
 

3041
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:17,390
one area to be satisfying
you know as you try and figure the rest

3042
01:10:17,390 --> 01:10:17,400
you know as you try and figure the rest
 

3043
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:19,610
you know as you try and figure the rest
of it out

3044
01:10:19,610 --> 01:10:19,620
of it out
 

3045
01:10:19,620 --> 01:10:22,490
of it out
I'm being deep

3046
01:10:22,490 --> 01:10:22,500
I'm being deep
 

3047
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:25,970
I'm being deep
in in some way yes but I don't think

3048
01:10:25,970 --> 01:10:25,980
in in some way yes but I don't think
 

3049
01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:27,530
in in some way yes but I don't think
that in life

3050
01:10:27,530 --> 01:10:27,540
that in life
 

3051
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:32,090
that in life
you will often go on to this drawing and

3052
01:10:32,090 --> 01:10:32,100
you will often go on to this drawing and
 

3053
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:34,310
you will often go on to this drawing and
tear something apart

3054
01:10:34,310 --> 01:10:34,320
tear something apart
 

3055
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:36,229
tear something apart
without the knowledge that it actually

3056
01:10:36,229 --> 01:10:36,239
without the knowledge that it actually
 

3057
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:39,950
without the knowledge that it actually
leads to a better outcome

3058
01:10:39,950 --> 01:10:39,960
leads to a better outcome
 

3059
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:42,649
leads to a better outcome
and then just it gets even worse and

3060
01:10:42,649 --> 01:10:42,659
and then just it gets even worse and
 

3061
01:10:42,659 --> 01:10:45,470
and then just it gets even worse and
worse I think for some people that could

3062
01:10:45,470 --> 01:10:45,480
worse I think for some people that could
 

3063
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:47,149
worse I think for some people that could
be true yes

3064
01:10:47,149 --> 01:10:47,159
be true yes
 

3065
01:10:47,159 --> 01:10:49,550
be true yes
but for me I don't think that's ever

3066
01:10:49,550 --> 01:10:49,560
but for me I don't think that's ever
 

3067
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:51,950
but for me I don't think that's ever
been really true yeah which is a good

3068
01:10:51,950 --> 01:10:51,960
been really true yeah which is a good
 

3069
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:54,530
been really true yeah which is a good
thing it's okay if we both never find a

3070
01:10:54,530 --> 01:10:54,540
thing it's okay if we both never find a
 

3071
01:10:54,540 --> 01:10:57,229
thing it's okay if we both never find a
perfect Rubik's Cube Kiara as long as

3072
01:10:57,229 --> 01:10:57,239
perfect Rubik's Cube Kiara as long as
 

3073
01:10:57,239 --> 01:10:59,209
perfect Rubik's Cube Kiara as long as
some of the sides can have some of the

3074
01:10:59,209 --> 01:10:59,219
some of the sides can have some of the
 

3075
01:10:59,219 --> 01:11:01,070
some of the sides can have some of the
same colors we should have never just

3076
01:11:01,070 --> 01:11:01,080
same colors we should have never just
 

3077
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:02,689
same colors we should have never just
that's the problem we should have never

3078
01:11:02,689 --> 01:11:02,699
that's the problem we should have never
 

3079
01:11:02,699 --> 01:11:04,149
that's the problem we should have never
destroyed them in the first place

3080
01:11:04,149 --> 01:11:04,159
destroyed them in the first place
 

3081
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:07,189
destroyed them in the first place
to not mess up the Rubik's cubes in the

3082
01:11:07,189 --> 01:11:07,199
to not mess up the Rubik's cubes in the
 

3083
01:11:07,199 --> 01:11:09,590
to not mess up the Rubik's cubes in the
first place if you if it ain't broke

3084
01:11:09,590 --> 01:11:09,600
first place if you if it ain't broke
 

3085
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:11,689
first place if you if it ain't broke
don't yes if it ain't broke don't fix it

3086
01:11:11,689 --> 01:11:11,699
don't yes if it ain't broke don't fix it
 

3087
01:11:11,699 --> 01:11:14,870
don't yes if it ain't broke don't fix it
exactly if it's fixed don't break it I

3088
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:14,880
exactly if it's fixed don't break it I
 

3089
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:16,750
exactly if it's fixed don't break it I
don't know what I'm talking only someone

3090
01:11:16,750 --> 01:11:16,760
don't know what I'm talking only someone
 

3091
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:20,390
don't know what I'm talking only someone
masochistic as [\h__\h] would do that yeah

3092
01:11:20,390 --> 01:11:20,400
masochistic as [\h__\h] would do that yeah
 

3093
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,970
masochistic as [\h__\h] would do that yeah
but instead we chose to mess up our

3094
01:11:22,970 --> 01:11:22,980
but instead we chose to mess up our
 

3095
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:25,370
but instead we chose to mess up our
Rubik's cubes of our own so of course if

3096
01:11:25,370 --> 01:11:25,380
Rubik's cubes of our own so of course if
 

3097
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:27,050
Rubik's cubes of our own so of course if
you if you inflict paint on something

3098
01:11:27,050 --> 01:11:27,060
you if you inflict paint on something
 

3099
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:28,490
you if you inflict paint on something
perfect of course you're getting pain

3100
01:11:28,490 --> 01:11:28,500
perfect of course you're getting pain
 

3101
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:32,149
perfect of course you're getting pain
back

3102
01:11:32,149 --> 01:11:32,159

 

3103
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:35,990

we deserve first challenging fate like

3104
01:11:35,990 --> 01:11:36,000
we deserve first challenging fate like
 

3105
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,330
we deserve first challenging fate like
that that's true just for the sake of

3106
01:11:38,330 --> 01:11:38,340
that that's true just for the sake of
 

3107
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:41,030
that that's true just for the sake of
[\h__\h] entertainment exactly just to

3108
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:41,040
[\h__\h] entertainment exactly just to
 

3109
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,709
[\h__\h] entertainment exactly just to
show the world that we're trying yeah

3110
01:11:42,709 --> 01:11:42,719
show the world that we're trying yeah
 

3111
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:45,050
show the world that we're trying yeah
why are we so superficial exactly we're

3112
01:11:45,050 --> 01:11:45,060
why are we so superficial exactly we're
 

3113
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:46,729
why are we so superficial exactly we're
doing this for entertainment but we just

3114
01:11:46,729 --> 01:11:46,739
doing this for entertainment but we just
 

3115
01:11:46,739 --> 01:11:49,010
doing this for entertainment but we just
could have had one perfect thing we

3116
01:11:49,010 --> 01:11:49,020
could have had one perfect thing we
 

3117
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:50,510
could have had one perfect thing we
could have already just had it and said

3118
01:11:50,510 --> 01:11:50,520
could have already just had it and said
 

3119
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:51,890
could have already just had it and said
look everyone look at this perfect

3120
01:11:51,890 --> 01:11:51,900
look everyone look at this perfect
 

3121
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:54,410
look everyone look at this perfect
Rubik's Cube but instead we chose to

3122
01:11:54,410 --> 01:11:54,420
Rubik's Cube but instead we chose to
 

3123
01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:57,290
Rubik's Cube but instead we chose to
challenge ourselves and we messed up our

3124
01:11:57,290 --> 01:11:57,300
challenge ourselves and we messed up our
 

3125
01:11:57,300 --> 01:11:59,090
challenge ourselves and we messed up our
Rubik's cubes and now we're frustrated

3126
01:11:59,090 --> 01:11:59,100
Rubik's cubes and now we're frustrated
 

3127
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:02,090
Rubik's cubes and now we're frustrated
yes we have to oh but we're very similar

3128
01:12:02,090 --> 01:12:02,100
yes we have to oh but we're very similar
 

3129
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:05,149
yes we have to oh but we're very similar
right now yeah we have to

3130
01:12:05,149 --> 01:12:05,159
right now yeah we have to
 

3131
01:12:05,159 --> 01:12:08,450
right now yeah we have to
um reflect on our actions as a streamer

3132
01:12:08,450 --> 01:12:08,460
um reflect on our actions as a streamer
 

3133
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:12,470
um reflect on our actions as a streamer
because that was a a very selfish thing

3134
01:12:12,470 --> 01:12:12,480
because that was a a very selfish thing
 

3135
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:15,410
because that was a a very selfish thing
of us to do this is our perfect Rubik's

3136
01:12:15,410 --> 01:12:15,420
of us to do this is our perfect Rubik's
 

3137
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:17,209
of us to do this is our perfect Rubik's
Cubes but you know what the truth is

3138
01:12:17,209 --> 01:12:17,219
Cubes but you know what the truth is
 

3139
01:12:17,219 --> 01:12:20,450
Cubes but you know what the truth is
Kiara yes no one has a perfect Rubik's

3140
01:12:20,450 --> 01:12:20,460
Kiara yes no one has a perfect Rubik's
 

3141
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:22,490
Kiara yes no one has a perfect Rubik's
Cube why

3142
01:12:22,490 --> 01:12:22,500
Cube why
 

3143
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:24,770
Cube why
because you can't solve life with an

3144
01:12:24,770 --> 01:12:24,780
because you can't solve life with an
 

3145
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:27,530
because you can't solve life with an
algorithm and that's why Rubik's cubes

3146
01:12:27,530 --> 01:12:27,540
algorithm and that's why Rubik's cubes
 

3147
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:29,149
algorithm and that's why Rubik's cubes
are not like life

3148
01:12:29,149 --> 01:12:29,159
are not like life
 

3149
01:12:29,159 --> 01:12:30,830
are not like life
I do think

3150
01:12:30,830 --> 01:12:30,840
I do think
 

3151
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:33,470
I do think
that is wrong recently we've seen many

3152
01:12:33,470 --> 01:12:33,480
that is wrong recently we've seen many
 

3153
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:35,510
that is wrong recently we've seen many
cases where people are more and more

3154
01:12:35,510 --> 01:12:35,520
cases where people are more and more
 

3155
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:38,570
cases where people are more and more
making it so that algorithms can see can

3156
01:12:38,570 --> 01:12:38,580
making it so that algorithms can see can
 

3157
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:41,390
making it so that algorithms can see can
like improve life I can remember this

3158
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:41,400
like improve life I can remember this
 

3159
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:43,610
like improve life I can remember this
like AI right

3160
01:12:43,610 --> 01:12:43,620
like AI right
 

3161
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:44,770
like AI right
but

3162
01:12:44,770 --> 01:12:44,780
but
 

3163
01:12:44,780 --> 01:12:48,890
but
you need something human

3164
01:12:48,890 --> 01:12:48,900
you need something human
 

3165
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:51,290
you need something human
we would like to think so right we hope

3166
01:12:51,290 --> 01:12:51,300
we would like to think so right we hope
 

3167
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:53,330
we would like to think so right we hope
that AI doesn't take away like all the

3168
01:12:53,330 --> 01:12:53,340
that AI doesn't take away like all the
 

3169
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:55,790
that AI doesn't take away like all the
jobs right and we still need humans

3170
01:12:55,790 --> 01:12:55,800
jobs right and we still need humans
 

3171
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:58,729
jobs right and we still need humans
we have now given up and given into

3172
01:12:58,729 --> 01:12:58,739
we have now given up and given into
 

3173
01:12:58,739 --> 01:13:01,490
we have now given up and given into
philosophy because we can't solve the

3174
01:13:01,490 --> 01:13:01,500
philosophy because we can't solve the
 

3175
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:04,790
philosophy because we can't solve the
kinurovic's cube man

3176
01:13:04,790 --> 01:13:04,800
kinurovic's cube man
 

3177
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:07,610
kinurovic's cube man
I watched I watched some videos recently

3178
01:13:07,610 --> 01:13:07,620
I watched I watched some videos recently
 

3179
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:11,510
I watched I watched some videos recently
about AI taking over and there was ah

3180
01:13:11,510 --> 01:13:11,520
about AI taking over and there was ah
 

3181
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:13,669
about AI taking over and there was ah
there was this uh

3182
01:13:13,669 --> 01:13:13,679
there was this uh
 

3183

Consciousness yet
 

3201
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:43,070
Consciousness yet
why is it just acting as if it doesn't

3202
01:13:43,070 --> 01:13:43,080
why is it just acting as if it doesn't
 

3203

does the AI see through there do they
 

3221
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:06,470
does the AI see through there do they
see through eyes the way that we see

3222
01:14:06,470 --> 01:14:06,480
see through eyes the way that we see

well

3234
01:14:22,490 --> 01:14:22,500
well
 

3235

well
we have our minds have been broken by a

3236
01:14:25,189 --> 01:14:25,199
we have our minds have been broken by a
 

3237
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:28,189
we have our minds have been broken by a
simple Rubik's Cube which week I think

3238
01:14:28,189 --> 01:14:28,199
simple Rubik's Cube which week I think
 

3239
01:14:28,199 --> 01:14:29,570
simple Rubik's Cube which week I think
we're just not mentally strong enough

3240
01:14:29,570 --> 01:14:29,580
we're just not mentally strong enough
