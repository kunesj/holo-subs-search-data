​​​ ​NoelMarine ASMR Collab​ ​​

5
00:00:05,723 --> 00:00:07,558
​​​ ​Houshou Marine is here!​ ​​

6
00:00:07,558 --> 00:00:09,526
​​​ ​Are you really whispering?​ ​​

7
00:00:09,526 --> 00:00:10,327
​​​ ​What?​ ​​

8
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:13,063
​​​ ​How is it, mateys?​ ​​

9
00:00:11,195 --> 00:00:12,763
​​​ ​Audio input was reversed and they were fixing it.​ ​​

10
00:00:13,063 --> 00:00:15,466
​​​ ​Does it feel good having your ears being touched?​ ​​

11
00:00:15,466 --> 00:00:17,968
​​​ ​So, uh... First of all, your voice ruins it.​ ​​

12
00:00:17,968 --> 00:00:19,670
​​​ ​What?! You jealous?​ ​​

13
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,705
​​​ ​So my voice ruins the mood.​ ​​

14
00:00:21,705 --> 00:00:23,540
​​​ ​If that's the case, how do I make it sound good?​ ​​

15
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,075
​​​ ​Do it like you're letting out a sigh...​ ​​

16
00:00:25,075 --> 00:00:26,377
​​​ ​Got it.​ ​​

17
00:00:26,377 --> 00:00:27,411
​​​ ​I got it.​ ​​

18
00:00:27,411 --> 00:00:28,278
​​​ ​Hold—​ ​​

19
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:29,013
​​​ ​Guys—​ ​​

20
00:00:29,013 --> 00:00:32,516
​​​ ​Like, listen. I want you guys to listen​ ​​
​​ ​to this without Alt+F4-ing.​ ​​

21
00:00:31,048 --> 00:00:34,918
​​​ ​* We recommend you listen to this with earphones on​ ​​

22
00:00:32,516 --> 00:00:35,019
​​​ ​Can I try speaking into your ears with a stud voice?​ ​​

23
00:00:35,019 --> 00:00:36,487
​​​ ​I-I'm paying—​ ​​

24
00:00:38,322 --> 00:00:39,923
​​​ ​I'm paying your ears a visit.​ ​​

25
00:00:39,923 --> 00:00:42,292
​​​ ​Okay, this stream's doomed.​ ​​

26
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:45,295
​​​ ​You won't hit those Alt + F4 keys, right?​ ​​

27
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:47,998
​​​ ​About 60% of the viewers did exactly that.​ ​​

28
00:00:47,998 --> 00:00:48,899
​​​ ​Please don't leave!​ ​​

29
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:51,135
​​​ ​You'll get to hear Noel's cute voice in just a bit,​ ​​

30
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:52,169
​​​ ​so please come back!​ ​​

31
00:00:52,169 --> 00:00:52,770
​​​ ​Okay, go.​ ​​

32
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,071
​​​ ​Please come back ❤️​ ​​

33
00:00:54,071 --> 00:00:55,639
​​​ ​I'm here too ❤️​ ​​

34
00:00:56,173 --> 00:00:57,174
​​​ ​It's a trap!​ ​​

35
00:00:58,108 --> 00:01:02,813
​​​ ​Marine-tan's going to say "Fire!" cutely,​ ​​
​​ ​so could you all go "Oiiink"?​ ​​

36
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:01,078
​​​ ​Oiiiiiiiiiiiink!!!​ ​​

37
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:05,115
​​​ ​"Fiiire!"​ ​​

38
00:01:07,951 --> 00:01:09,820
​​​ ​I only see like, 5 people saying it.​ ​​

39
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,889
​​​ ​Oh, it's Shion-tan!​ ​​

40
00:01:11,889 --> 00:01:13,190
​​​ ​Yoo-hoo, Shion-tan!​ ​​

41
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:13,824
​​​ ​Geh!​ ​​

00:01:19,396 --> 00:01:21,965
​​​ ​Oh, Shion-tan! Yoo-poo!​ ​​

45
00:01:21,965 --> 00:01:25,069
​​​ ​Marine-tan! How old are you?​ ​​

46
00:01:25,069 --> 00:01:26,670
​​​ ​Let's see... What age should I pick? Oh!​ ​​

47
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:27,271
​​​ ​Three!​ ​​

48
00:01:27,271 --> 00:01:27,805
​​​ ​Four!​ ​​

49
00:01:27,805 --> 00:01:28,772
​​​ ​Four years old!​ ​​

50
00:01:28,772 --> 00:01:30,808
​​​ ​Let's sing a playtime song together!​ ​​

51
00:01:30,808 --> 00:01:32,376
​​​ ​Let's sing Happy Jam Jam!​ ​​

52
00:01:32,376 --> 00:01:33,644
​​​ ​Happy Jam Jam?​ ​​

53
00:01:33,644 --> 00:01:34,111
​​​ ​Yup!​ ​​

54
00:01:34,111 --> 00:01:35,479
​​​ ​Which one is that? Sing it!​ ​​

55
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:42,486
​​​ ​🎵Happy Jam Jam, it's the best!​ ​​
​​ ​Let's dance with smiles that never change!​ ​​

​​​ ​🎵Happy— 🎵​ ​​

58
00:01:44,655 --> 00:01:47,691
​​​ ​Sorry! You were so cute I just—​ ​​

59
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,992
​​​ ​WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU, MARINE-TAN?!​ ​​

60
00:01:48,992 --> 00:01:51,595
​​​ ​My 🐷 side leaked out!​ ​​

61
00:01:51,595 --> 00:01:52,796
​​​ ​You were so cute,​ ​​
​​ ​my 🐷 side got loose!​ ​​

62
00:01:52,796 --> 00:02:00,604
​​​ ​I heard that you asked your viewers​ ​​
​​ ​if they'd say "OINK!" earlier, Marine-tan.​ ​​

63
00:02:00,604 --> 00:02:02,873
​​​ ​Did you do it too, Shion-tan?​ ​​

64
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:05,342
​​​ ​Did you think I'd do it?​ ​​

65
00:02:05,342 --> 00:02:07,978
​​​ ​Why didn't you? Don't you feel bad for me?​ ​​

66
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:09,213
​​​ ​I wouldn't do such a horrible—​ ​​

67
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:10,013
​​​ ​Feel bad...?​ ​​

68
00:02:10,013 --> 00:02:12,316
​​​ ​There were only like, five people who did it!​ ​​

69
00:02:12,316 --> 00:02:13,650
​​​ ​Don't you think that's just sad?​ ​​

70
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:14,651
​​​ ​It is!​ ​​

71
00:02:14,651 --> 00:02:16,587
​​​ ​Okay, I'll do it for you then!​ ​​

72
00:02:16,587 --> 00:02:17,855
​​​ ​Let's do it, Shion-tan!​ ​​

73
00:02:17,855 --> 00:02:18,789
​​​ ​Sure!​ ​​

74
00:02:18,789 --> 00:02:20,524
​​​ ​FIRE!!!​ ​​

75
00:02:20,524 --> 00:02:21,859
​​​ ​OINK! ❤️​ ​​

76
00:02:22,593 --> 00:02:24,027
​​​ ​That's not fair, Shion-tan...​ ​​

77
00:02:24,027 --> 00:02:26,196
​​​ ​Your cutesy act is unfair! What a cheat!​ ​​

78
00:02:26,196 --> 00:02:29,333
​​​ ​I wanna— I wanna see your take on it!​ ​​

79
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:30,968
​​​ ​Sure! Say "Fire" when ready!​ ​​

80
00:02:30,968 --> 00:02:31,735
​​​ ​Okay, ready?​ ​​

81
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:32,169
​​​ ​Yup.​ ​​

82
00:02:32,169 --> 00:02:32,970

​​​ ​Mwah!​ ​​

102
00:03:01,798 --> 00:03:03,600
​​​ ​She replied with "Cringe."​ ​​

103
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,135
​​​ ​The heck she think she is?​ ​​

104
00:03:05,135 --> 00:03:05,769
​​​ ​I'm calling her.​ ​​

105
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:06,603

​​​ ​You're playing along with me (recently)​ ​​
​​ ​'cause we're BFFs now​ ​​

118
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:22,186
​​​ ​and not because you've gotten sick of me, right?​ ​​

119
00:03:22,186 --> 00:03:23,921
​​​ ​Yeah! That's totally it! (Just playing along)​ ​​

120
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:25,656
​​​ ​All right, then. Mwah ❤️​ ​​

​​​ ​Hold up. Wait. Please. Rushia?!​ ​​

143
00:03:48,946 --> 00:03:52,649
​​​ ​Shion-senpai just messaged me. "Do you like me?"​ ​​

​​​ ​Yeah, I like you, Shion...​ ​​

146
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:55,152
​​​ ​Did you get a kiss from her?​ ​​

147
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:56,954
​​​ ​In the end? Nope.​ ​​

148
00:03:56,954 --> 00:04:00,357
​​​ ​Oh! Shion-senpai just messaged me going, "Mwah!"​ ​​

​​​ ​You're here for that, aren't you?​ ​​

156
00:04:10,601 --> 00:04:13,570
​​​ ​I sure am, Marine-senpai! I love you! ❤️​ ​​

157
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,339
​​​ ​I knew it! Still, though, it's uh—​ ​​

158
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:17,241
​​​ ​Mwah.​ ​​

159

165
00:04:17,975 --> 00:04:21,178
​​​ ​Anyways, Rushia just ripped my boobs off​ ​​
​​ ​and turned me flat,​ ​​

166
