and maybe when they say return it means
 

4173
01:49:30,060 --> 01:49:31,669
and maybe when they say return it means
that they're also returning like the

4851
02:09:17,040 --> 02:09:19,990
there's a VR version that's I think even
more expensive than the original version

4852
02:09:19,990 --> 02:09:20,000
more expensive than the original version
 

4853
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:23,030
more expensive than the original version
and and I feel like if it's also buggy

02:09:23,030 --> 02:09:23,040
and and I feel like if it's also buggy
 

4855
02:09:23,040 --> 02:09:26,390

for even more bugs yeah okay it's it's

4860
02:09:32,450 --> 02:09:32,460
for even more bugs yeah okay it's it's
 

4861
02:09:32,460 --> 02:09:33,830
for even more bugs yeah okay it's it's
less buggy

4862
02:09:33,830 --> 02:09:33,840
less buggy
 

4863
02:09:33,840 --> 02:09:36,169

5121
02:15:34,560 --> 02:15:37,069
us in the watch along we weren't pretty
sure at the end that that was Gandalf

5122
02:15:37,069 --> 02:15:37,079
sure at the end that that was Gandalf
 

5123
02:15:37,079 --> 02:15:40,910
sure at the end that that was Gandalf
but then I I watched a a review of the

5124
02:15:40,910 --> 02:15:40,920
but then I I watched a a review of the
 

5125
02:15:40,920 --> 02:15:44,930
but then I I watched a a review of the
last episode and it's it's it made me

5126
02:15:44,930 --> 02:15:44,940
last episode and it's it's it made me
 

5127
02:15:44,940 --> 02:15:47,330
last episode and it's it's it made me
question it too like that might not be

5128
02:15:47,330 --> 02:15:47,340
question it too like that might not be
 

5129
02:15:47,340 --> 02:15:49,250
question it too like that might not be
Gandalf after all

5130
02:15:49,250 --> 02:15:49,260
Gandalf after all
 

5131
02:15:49,260 --> 02:15:51,770
Gandalf after all
um because in the rings of power in an

5132
02:15:51,770 --> 02:15:51,780
um because in the rings of power in an
 

5133
02:15:51,780 --> 02:15:53,510
um because in the rings of power in an
episode at the end he said they're going

5134
02:15:53,510 --> 02:15:53,520
episode at the end he said they're going
 

5135
02:15:53,520 --> 02:15:55,970
episode at the end he said they're going
east right and Gandalf however said he

5136
02:15:55,970 --> 02:15:55,980
east right and Gandalf however said he
 

5137
02:15:55,980 --> 02:15:57,910
east right and Gandalf however said he
will never go east right

5138
02:15:57,910 --> 02:15:57,920
will never go east right
 

5139
02:15:57,920 --> 02:16:01,550
will never go east right
and yeah legally I guess as well that's

5140
02:16:01,550 --> 02:16:01,560
and yeah legally I guess as well that's
 

5141
02:16:01,560 --> 02:16:03,169
and yeah legally I guess as well that's
a good argument too

5142
02:16:03,169 --> 02:16:03,179
a good argument too
 

5143
02:16:03,179 --> 02:16:05,990
a good argument too
so it might not be kind of even though

5144
02:16:05,990 --> 02:16:06,000
so it might not be kind of even though
 

5145
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,149
so it might not be kind of even though
he was set I think they might be doing

5146
02:16:08,149 --> 02:16:08,159
he was set I think they might be doing
 

5147
02:16:08,159 --> 02:16:10,490
