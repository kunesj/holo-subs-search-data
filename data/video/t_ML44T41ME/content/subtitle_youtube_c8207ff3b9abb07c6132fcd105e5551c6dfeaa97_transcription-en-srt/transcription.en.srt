was kind of weird because the the wings
 

5769
02:35:06,399 --> 02:35:08,150
was kind of weird because the the wings
were definitely

its leg the whole time and and like I

5774
02:35:13,269 --> 02:35:13,279
its leg the whole time and and like I
 

5775
02:35:13,279 --> 02:35:14,710
its leg the whole time and and like I
don't know it seemed stuck so I thought

5776
02:35:14,710 --> 02:35:14,720
don't know it seemed stuck so I thought
 

5777
02:35:14,720 --> 02:35:16,790
don't know it seemed stuck so I thought
maybe the leg was broken but they don't

5778
02:35:16,790 --> 02:35:16,800
maybe the leg was broken but they don't
 

5779
02:35:16,800 --> 02:35:18,389
maybe the leg was broken but they don't
have bones so I don't know how that

5780
02:35:18,389 --> 02:35:18,399
have bones so I don't know how that
 

5781
02:35:18,399 --> 02:35:20,309
have bones so I don't know how that
works but

5782
02:35:20,309 --> 02:35:20,319

as a concept but this time we're going
 

9187
04:07:47,159 --> 04:07:50,309

to um scatter eggs apparently in like a

9188
04:07:50,309 --> 04:07:50,319
to um scatter eggs apparently in like a
 

9189
04:07:50,319 --> 04:07:52,710
to um scatter eggs apparently in like a
smaller studio so to

9190
04:07:52,710 --> 04:07:52,720
smaller studio so to
 

9191
04:07:52,720 --> 04:07:58,269
smaller studio so to
say and uh so then we can use the the

9192
04:07:58,269 --> 04:07:58,279
say and uh so then we can use the the
 

9193
04:07:58,279 --> 04:08:00,630
say and uh so then we can use the the
camera and somebody will be controlling

9194
04:08:00,630 --> 04:08:00,640
camera and somebody will be controlling
 

9195
04:08:00,640 --> 04:08:03,550

the camera and switch angles and all

9196
04:08:03,550 --> 04:08:03,560
the camera and switch angles and all
 

9197
04:08:03,560 --> 04:08:05,149
the camera and switch angles and all
that so we will not be using like last

9198
04:08:05,149 --> 04:08:05,159
that so we will not be using like last
 

9199
04:08:05,159 --> 04:08:08,630

hard to learn and remember especially

10606
04:47:34,350 --> 04:47:34,360
hard to learn and remember especially
 

10607
04:47:34,360 --> 04:47:36,270
hard to learn and remember especially
cuz I always learn them alone at home

10608
04:47:36,270 --> 04:47:36,280
cuz I always learn them alone at home
 

10609
04:47:36,280 --> 04:47:38,670
cuz I always learn them alone at home
watching the reference

10610
04:47:38,670 --> 04:47:38,680
watching the reference
 

10611
04:47:38,680 --> 04:47:41,948
watching the reference
video uh and it's kind of different when

10612
04:47:41,948 --> 04:47:41,958
video uh and it's kind of different when
 

10613
04:47:41,958 --> 04:47:44,708
video uh and it's kind of different when
learning from a teacher step by step in

10614
04:47:44,708 --> 04:47:44,718
learning from a teacher step by step in
 

10615
04:47:44,718 --> 04:47:45,750
learning from a teacher step by step in
a good

10616
04:47:45,750 --> 04:47:45,760
a good
 

10617
04:47:45,760 --> 04:47:48,150
a good
pacing I like both ways because at least

10618
04:47:48,150 --> 04:47:48,160
pacing I like both ways because at least
 

10619
04:47:48,160 --> 04:47:49,990
pacing I like both ways because at least
when I learn it at home I can go at my

10620
04:47:49,990 --> 04:47:50,000
when I learn it at home I can go at my
 

10621
04:47:50,000 --> 04:47:52,070
when I learn it at home I can go at my
Pace but then I take too many breaks and

10622
04:47:52,070 --> 04:47:52,080
Pace but then I take too many breaks and
 

10623
04:47:52,080 --> 04:47:54,708
Pace but then I take too many breaks and
also it's like confusing yeah and I may

10624
04:47:54,708 --> 04:47:54,718
also it's like confusing yeah and I may
 

10625
04:47:54,718 --> 04:47:57,470
also it's like confusing yeah and I may
miss I may miss some

10626
04:47:57,470 --> 04:47:57,480
miss I may miss some
 

10627
04:47:57,480 --> 04:48:01,750
miss I may miss some
details but yeah so Kima I also learned

10628
04:48:01,750 --> 04:48:01,760
details but yeah so Kima I also learned
 

10629
04:48:01,760 --> 04:48:05,150
details but yeah so Kima I also learned
alone at home but it was generally

10630
04:48:05,150 --> 04:48:05,160
alone at home but it was generally
 

10631
04:48:05,160 --> 04:48:07,070
alone at home but it was generally
somehow easier to pick up because I feel

10632
04:48:07,070 --> 04:48:07,080
somehow easier to pick up because I feel
 

10633
04:48:07,080 --> 04:48:09,788
somehow easier to pick up because I feel
like there were less quick succession

10634
04:48:09,788 --> 04:48:09,798
like there were less quick succession
 

10635
04:48:09,798 --> 04:48:11,830
like there were less quick succession
different kind of moves stacked on top

10636
04:48:11,830 --> 04:48:11,840
different kind of moves stacked on top
 

10637
04:48:11,840 --> 04:48:14,190
different kind of moves stacked on top
each other but they still

10638
04:48:14,190 --> 04:48:14,200
each other but they still
 

10639
04:48:14,200 --> 04:48:16,310
each other but they still
seemed

10640
04:48:16,310 --> 04:48:16,320
seemed
 

10641
04:48:16,320 --> 04:48:19,190
seemed
pretty how to say

10642
04:48:19,190 --> 04:48:19,200
pretty how to say
 

10643
04:48:19,200 --> 04:48:22,750
pretty how to say
memorable and may I say I

10644
04:48:22,750 --> 04:48:22,760
