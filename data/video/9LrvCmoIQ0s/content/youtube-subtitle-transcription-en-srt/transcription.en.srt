539
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,830
puppet and the puppet was on a little
bit of a elevated platform and so in the

540
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:55,840
bit of a elevated platform and so in the
 

541
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,110
bit of a elevated platform and so in the
Next Room there was also an elevated

there's a button in it but there's a
 

547
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,510
there's a button in it but there's a
wall in between and I first thought okay

548
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:08,520
wall in between and I first thought okay
 

549
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,110
wall in between and I first thought okay
well surely you have to use the things

550
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:10,120
well surely you have to use the things
 

551
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,230
well surely you have to use the things

552
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:13,240
you learned just now so I put the puppet
 

553
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,470

on this enough in this room it had also
 

555
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,070
on this enough in this room it had also
an elevated platform but and then I

556
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:19,080
an elevated platform but and then I
 

557
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,950
an elevated platform but and then I
spawned the ghost but of nothing it

558
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:21,960
spawned the ghost but of nothing it
 

559
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,950
spawned the ghost but of nothing it
didn't really work of course like there

560
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:23,960
didn't really work of course like there
 

561
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,950
didn't really work of course like there
was no point in doing that

562
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:26,960
was no point in doing that
 

563
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,350
was no point in doing that
um I tried to like do it in other ways I

564
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:31,360
um I tried to like do it in other ways I
 

565
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,149
um I tried to like do it in other ways I
tried

566
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:32,159
tried
 

567
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,430
tried
to get my ghost to go through the wall

568
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:35,440
to get my ghost to go through the wall
 

569
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,149
to get my ghost to go through the wall
but I didn't really realize I

570
00:20:38,149 --> 00:20:38,159
but I didn't really realize I
 

571
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,470
but I didn't really realize I
forgot I for Gore you got stuck on it

572
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:41,480
forgot I for Gore you got stuck on it
 

573
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,350
forgot I for Gore you got stuck on it
too really I for Gore that you can if

574
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:45,360
too really I for Gore that you can if
 

575
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,909
too really I for Gore that you can if
that if you target I know that if you

576
00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:47,919
that if you target I know that if you
 

577
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,590
that if you target I know that if you
target monsters they will go for the

578
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:49,600

things these um these button thingies
 

585
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,750
things these um these button thingies
I never figured that out that that's how

586
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:02,760
I never figured that out that that's how
 

587
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,350
I never figured that out that that's how
you're supposed to do it that that I I

588
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:04,360
you're supposed to do it that that I I
 

589
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,390
you're supposed to do it that that I I
knew that you would logically with a

590
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:06,400
knew that you would logically with a
 

591
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,830
knew that you would logically with a
closed wall and you just having learned

592
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:08,840
closed wall and you just having learned
 

593
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,789
closed wall and you just having learned
ghosts that you would want to send the

594
00:21:10,789 --> 00:21:10,799
ghosts that you would want to send the
 

595
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,070
ghosts that you would want to send the
ghost through that's why so I was like

596
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:13,080
ghost through that's why so I was like
 

597
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,950
ghost through that's why so I was like
trying to do the thing where you spawn

598
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:14,960
trying to do the thing where you spawn
 

599
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,549
trying to do the thing where you spawn
something further away from you I tried

600
00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:17,559
something further away from you I tried
 

601
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:19,310
something further away from you I tried
that but it didn't go through the wall

602
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:19,320
that but it didn't go through the wall
 

603
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,909
that but it didn't go through the wall
and everything I I was hoping that the

604
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:21,919
and everything I I was hoping that the
 

605
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,950
and everything I I was hoping that the
ghost would go there on their own and

606
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:24,960
ghost would go there on their own and
 

607
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,390
ghost would go there on their own and
then hit that thing somehow but the

608
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:27,400
then hit that thing somehow but the
 

609
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,269
then hit that thing somehow but the
ghost was not motivated to hit it cuz it

610
00:21:29,269 --> 00:21:29,279
ghost was not motivated to hit it cuz it
 

611
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:33,110
ghost was not motivated to hit it cuz it
was not an enemy so I I guess because it

612
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:33,120
was not an enemy so I I guess because it
 

613
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,190
was not an enemy so I I guess because it
wouldn't see it on its own to to like as

614
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:36,200
wouldn't see it on its own to to like as
 

615
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,789
wouldn't see it on its own to to like as
a Target as an enemy was also why I

616
00:21:39,789 --> 00:21:39,799
a Target as an enemy was also why I
 

617
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:43,110
a Target as an enemy was also why I
didn't think that that would help me

618
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:43,120
didn't think that that would help me
 

619
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,190
didn't think that that would help me
targeting the

620
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:45,200
targeting the
 

621
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,549
targeting the
switch so I was

622
00:21:47,549 --> 00:21:47,559
switch so I was
 

623
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:49,950
switch so I was
so

624
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:49,960
so
 

625
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,990
so
clueless the only other thing that I

626
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:52,000
clueless the only other thing that I
 

627
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,950
clueless the only other thing that I
could think of is spawning this little

628
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:54,960
could think of is spawning this little
 

629
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,669
could think of is spawning this little
guy and

630
00:21:59,669 --> 00:21:59,679

 

631
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:00,710

I

632
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:00,720
I
 

633
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,909
I
guess then it did come to mind to Target

634
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:05,919
guess then it did come to mind to Target
 

635
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,789
guess then it did come to mind to Target
did I though did I I I no I think I

636
00:22:08,789 --> 00:22:08,799
did I though did I I I no I think I
 

637
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,950
did I though did I I I no I think I
still didn't did

638
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:11,960
still didn't did
 

639
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:16,310
still didn't did
I but I did get him to

640
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:16,320
I but I did get him to
 

641
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,549
I but I did get him to
shoot and and so normally his shots

642
00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:19,559
shoot and and so normally his shots
 

643
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:22,830
shoot and and so normally his shots
don't go through the wall

644
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:22,840
don't go through the wall
 

645
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:27,029
don't go through the wall
but I somehow managed to magically I

646
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:27,039
but I somehow managed to magically I
 

647
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,549
but I somehow managed to magically I
think it's like loky a glitch that I

648
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:29,559
think it's like loky a glitch that I
 

649
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:33,510
think it's like loky a glitch that I
caused without wanting it but somehow I

650
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:33,520
caused without wanting it but somehow I
 

651
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,669
caused without wanting it but somehow I
got him to shoot really

652
00:22:35,669 --> 00:22:35,679
got him to shoot really
 

653
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,310
got him to shoot really
high and somehow like barely cuz there's

654
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:40,320
high and somehow like barely cuz there's
 

655
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,909
high and somehow like barely cuz there's
an invisible ceiling but barely I got it

656
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:43,919
an invisible ceiling but barely I got it
 

657
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,350
an invisible ceiling but barely I got it
to clip

658
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:45,360
to clip
 

659
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,310
to clip
through and yeah he can teleport but he

660
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:48,320
through and yeah he can teleport but he
 

661
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,110
through and yeah he can teleport but he
had no motivation to teleport

662
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:51,120
had no motivation to teleport
 

663
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,750
had no motivation to teleport
anywhere usually but I I don't know how

664
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:53,760
anywhere usually but I I don't know how
 

665

m it was pretty good I feel like I made
it a little bit

9022
04:29:01,630 --> 04:29:01,640
it a little bit
 

9023
04:29:01,640 --> 04:29:04,870
it a little bit
too sweet or or is that just how it ends

9024
04:29:04,870 --> 04:29:04,880
too sweet or or is that just how it ends
 

9025
04:29:04,880 --> 04:29:07,830
too sweet or or is that just how it ends
up I don't know but it could have used a

9027
04:29:07,840 --> 04:29:11,269
up I don't know but it could have used a
bit more savoriness to it I think the

9028
04:29:11,269 --> 04:29:11,279
bit more savoriness to it I think the
 

9029
