02:30:00,550 --> 02:30:00,560
we climb up and we like to the next my
 

5101
02:30:00,560 --> 02:30:02,230
we climb up and we like to the next my
vision is hazy and I do not know why we

5102
02:30:02,230 --> 02:30:02,240
vision is hazy and I do not know why we
 

5103
02:30:02,240 --> 02:30:04,070
vision is hazy and I do not know why we
want to go the opposite direction I have

5104
02:30:04,070 --> 02:30:04,080
want to go the opposite direction I have
 

5105
02:30:04,080 --> 02:30:06,870
want to go the opposite direction I have
no idea because I've noticed that the

5106
02:30:06,870 --> 02:30:06,880
no idea because I've noticed that the
 

5107
02:30:06,880 --> 02:30:09,349
no idea because I've noticed that the
tree when fully grown it is cloudy

5108
02:30:09,349 --> 02:30:09,359
tree when fully grown it is cloudy
 

5109
02:30:09,359 --> 02:30:11,269
tree when fully grown it is cloudy
reaches connection the other side the

5110
02:30:11,269 --> 02:30:11,279
reaches connection the other side the
 

5111
02:30:11,279 --> 02:30:14,150
reaches connection the other side the
other platform Which is

5112
02:30:14,150 --> 02:30:14,160
other platform Which is
 

5113
02:30:14,160 --> 02:30:17,429
other platform Which is
higher where we originally went out but

5114
02:30:17,429 --> 02:30:17,439
higher where we originally went out but
 

5115
02:30:17,439 --> 02:30:20,590
higher where we originally went out but
it's hard to climb yeah

5116
02:30:20,590 --> 02:30:20,600
it's hard to climb yeah
 

5117
02:30:20,600 --> 02:30:22,590
it's hard to climb yeah
but don't don't go so don't make the big

5118
02:30:22,590 --> 02:30:22,600
but don't don't go so don't make the big
 

5119
02:30:22,600 --> 02:30:24,349
but don't don't go so don't make the big
jump if you're at the top don't make the

5120
02:30:24,349 --> 02:30:24,359
jump if you're at the top don't make the
 

5121
02:30:24,359 --> 02:30:28,950
jump if you're at the top don't make the
big jump I want to jump together okay we

5122
02:30:28,950 --> 02:30:28,960

 

5123
02:30:28,960 --> 02:30:31,750

jump I'll wait for but we got to find

5124
02:30:31,750 --> 02:30:31,760
jump I'll wait for but we got to find
 

5125
02:30:31,760 --> 02:30:36,510
jump I'll wait for but we got to find
the right path this is difficult

5126
02:30:36,510 --> 02:30:36,520

 

5127
02:30:36,520 --> 02:30:40,389

huh Elizabeth we uh we uh you at the top

5128
02:30:40,389 --> 02:30:40,399
huh Elizabeth we uh we uh you at the top
 

5129
02:30:40,399 --> 02:30:44,469
huh Elizabeth we uh we uh you at the top
of the tree oh no let's try to get to

5130
02:30:44,469 --> 02:30:44,479
of the tree oh no let's try to get to
 

5131
02:30:44,479 --> 02:30:47,469
of the tree oh no let's try to get to
the very top of the tree because I think

5132
02:30:47,469 --> 02:30:47,479
the very top of the tree because I think
 

5133
02:30:47,479 --> 02:30:51,030
the very top of the tree because I think
if we jump oh yeah yeah cuz it reaches

5134
02:30:51,030 --> 02:30:51,040
if we jump oh yeah yeah cuz it reaches
 

5135
02:30:51,040 --> 02:30:52,830
if we jump oh yeah yeah cuz it reaches
just the perfect height you know and

5136
02:30:52,830 --> 02:30:52,840
just the perfect height you know and
 

5137
02:30:52,840 --> 02:30:54,630
just the perfect height you know and
that already looked suspicious to me

5138
02:30:54,630 --> 02:30:54,640
that already looked suspicious to me
 

5139
02:30:54,640 --> 02:30:56,710
that already looked suspicious to me
when I first one was in this dungeon and

5140
02:30:56,710 --> 02:30:56,720
when I first one was in this dungeon and
 

5141
02:30:56,720 --> 02:30:59,590
when I first one was in this dungeon and
my RPG sensors were T tingling yeah but

5142
02:30:59,590 --> 02:30:59,600
my RPG sensors were T tingling yeah but
 

5143
02:30:59,600 --> 02:31:02,590
my RPG sensors were T tingling yeah but
how do you jump from here well we got to

5144
02:31:02,590 --> 02:31:02,600
how do you jump from here well we got to
 

5145
02:31:02,600 --> 02:31:04,830
how do you jump from here well we got to
find a way it must be possible otherwise

5146
02:31:04,830 --> 02:31:04,840
find a way it must be possible otherwise
 

5147
02:31:04,840 --> 02:31:07,110
find a way it must be possible otherwise
I don't think the tree would like really

5148
02:31:07,110 --> 02:31:07,120
I don't think the tree would like really
 

5149
02:31:07,120 --> 02:31:10,150
I don't think the tree would like really
grow this big Kai do you remember you

5150
02:31:10,150 --> 02:31:10,160
grow this big Kai do you remember you
 

5151
02:31:10,160 --> 02:31:12,429
grow this big Kai do you remember you
made you cooked something to make the J

5152
02:31:12,429 --> 02:31:12,439
made you cooked something to make the J
 

5153
02:31:12,439 --> 02:31:14,630
made you cooked something to make the J
the jump higher can you make can you can

5154
02:31:14,630 --> 02:31:14,640
the jump higher can you make can you can
 

5155
02:31:14,640 --> 02:31:16,870
the jump higher can you make can you can
you give one to me as well I want to

5156
02:31:16,870 --> 02:31:16,880
you give one to me as well I want to
 

5157
02:31:16,880 --> 02:31:19,950
you give one to me as well I want to
try I would need I already ate the first

5158
02:31:19,950 --> 02:31:19,960
try I would need I already ate the first
 

5159
02:31:19,960 --> 02:31:21,630
try I would need I already ate the first
first one and I don't have anym I would

5160
02:31:21,630 --> 02:31:21,640
first one and I don't have anym I would
 

5161
02:31:21,640 --> 02:31:23,190
first one and I don't have anym I would
need more ingredients but I think we

5162
02:31:23,190 --> 02:31:23,200
need more ingredients but I think we
 

5163
02:31:23,200 --> 02:31:24,510
need more ingredients but I think we
should be able to do it without because

5164
02:31:24,510 --> 02:31:24,520
should be able to do it without because
 

5165
02:31:24,520 --> 02:31:26,910
should be able to do it without because
honestly the jump it didn't get much

5166
02:31:26,910 --> 02:31:26,920
honestly the jump it didn't get much
 

5167
02:31:26,920 --> 02:31:29,990
honestly the jump it didn't get much
bigger it was just like like 5

5168
02:31:29,990 --> 02:31:30,000
bigger it was just like like 5
 

5169
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:34,110
bigger it was just like like 5
cm I don't know if it's really small jum

5170
02:31:34,110 --> 02:31:34,120
cm I don't know if it's really small jum
 

5171
02:31:34,120 --> 02:31:37,670
cm I don't know if it's really small jum
from there yeah um there must be a

5172
02:31:37,670 --> 02:31:37,680
from there yeah um there must be a
 

5173
02:31:37,680 --> 02:31:40,870
from there yeah um there must be a
different path I guess a different path

5174
02:31:40,870 --> 02:31:40,880
different path I guess a different path
 

5175
02:31:40,880 --> 02:31:44,950
different path I guess a different path
from the other

5176
02:31:44,950 --> 02:31:44,960

 

5177
02:31:44,960 --> 02:31:48,870

side definitely not it or I wonder if it

5178
02:31:48,870 --> 02:31:48,880
side definitely not it or I wonder if it
 

5179
02:31:48,880 --> 02:31:53,230
side definitely not it or I wonder if it
can bro if this is the last stage of the

5180
02:31:53,230 --> 02:31:53,240
can bro if this is the last stage of the
 

5181
02:31:53,240 --> 02:31:57,990
can bro if this is the last stage of the
tree

5182
02:31:57,990 --> 02:31:58,000

 

5183
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,950

Grove even like 100% sure about any of

5184
02:32:00,950 --> 02:32:00,960
Grove even like 100% sure about any of
 

5185
02:32:00,960 --> 02:32:02,550
Grove even like 100% sure about any of
this of

5186
02:32:02,550 --> 02:32:02,560
this of
 

5187
02:32:02,560 --> 02:32:06,230
this of
course I just had a feeling you know

5188
02:32:06,230 --> 02:32:06,240
course I just had a feeling you know
 

5189
02:32:06,240 --> 02:32:08,870
course I just had a feeling you know
yeah I mean we we here to explore it's

5190
02:32:08,870 --> 02:32:08,880
yeah I mean we we here to explore it's
 

5191
02:32:08,880 --> 02:32:12,190
yeah I mean we we here to explore it's
fine worst case we just go back wait

5192
02:32:12,190 --> 02:32:12,200
fine worst case we just go back wait
 

5193
02:32:12,200 --> 02:32:14,389
fine worst case we just go back wait

you go
around uh

5200
02:32:20,510 --> 02:32:20,520
around uh
 

5201
02:32:20,520 --> 02:32:22,309
around uh
but I'm not really sure where to go from

5202
02:32:22,309 --> 02:32:22,319
but I'm not really sure where to go from
 

5203
02:32:22,319 --> 02:32:23,910
but I'm not really sure where to go from
here I don't think it I don't think it

5204
02:32:23,910 --> 02:32:23,920
here I don't think it I don't think it
 

5205
02:32:23,920 --> 02:32:26,790
here I don't think it I don't think it
helps what I've

5206
02:32:26,790 --> 02:32:26,800

 

5207
02:32:26,800 --> 02:32:30,269

done yeah there's buttons here too which

5208
02:32:30,269 --> 02:32:30,279
done yeah there's buttons here too which
 

5209
02:32:30,279 --> 02:32:34,630
done yeah there's buttons here too which
some people say the buttons uh show like

5210
02:32:34,630 --> 02:32:34,640
some people say the buttons uh show like
 

5211
02:32:34,640 --> 02:32:38,309
some people say the buttons uh show like
the way to the next like jumpy platforms

5212
02:32:38,309 --> 02:32:38,319
the way to the next like jumpy platforms
 

5213
02:32:38,319 --> 02:32:44,030
the way to the next like jumpy platforms
but it doesn't really maybe we do need a

5214
02:32:44,030 --> 02:32:44,040

 

5215
02:32:44,040 --> 02:32:46,710

potion I don't fix the potion okay

5216
02:32:46,710 --> 02:32:46,720
potion I don't fix the potion okay
 

5217
02:32:46,720 --> 02:32:49,550
potion I don't fix the potion okay
listen I try to jump but are you at the

5218
02:32:49,550 --> 02:32:49,560
listen I try to jump but are you at the
 

5219
02:32:49,560 --> 02:32:50,550
listen I try to jump but are you at the
bottom

5220
02:32:50,550 --> 02:32:50,560
bottom
 

5221
02:32:50,560 --> 02:32:52,790
bottom
yeah can you try leading another

5222
02:32:52,790 --> 02:32:52,800
yeah can you try leading another
 

5223
02:32:52,800 --> 02:32:55,349
yeah can you try leading another
skeleton leading another skeleton

5224
02:32:55,349 --> 02:32:55,359
skeleton leading another skeleton
 

5225
02:32:55,359 --> 02:32:58,469
skeleton leading another skeleton
there's no more skeleton oh so it is the

5226
02:32:58,469 --> 02:32:58,479
there's no more skeleton oh so it is the
 

5227
02:32:58,479 --> 02:33:01,870
there's no more skeleton oh so it is the
maximum okay interesting

5228
02:33:01,870 --> 02:33:01,880
maximum okay interesting
 

5229
02:33:01,880 --> 02:33:04,910
maximum okay interesting
yeah what if we may maybe the the trees

5230
02:33:04,910 --> 02:33:04,920
yeah what if we may maybe the the trees
 

5231
02:33:04,920 --> 02:33:07,389
yeah what if we may maybe the the trees
over there

5232
02:33:07,389 --> 02:33:07,399

 

5233
02:33:07,399 --> 02:33:08,990

connect

5234
02:33:08,990 --> 02:33:09,000
connect
 

5235
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:13,230
connect
uh oh we can try uh growing those again

5236
02:33:13,230 --> 02:33:13,240
uh oh we can try uh growing those again
 

5237
02:33:13,240 --> 02:33:16,630
uh oh we can try uh growing those again
and see yeah if it maybe helps

5238
02:33:16,630 --> 02:33:16,640
and see yeah if it maybe helps
 

5239
02:33:16,640 --> 02:33:18,830
and see yeah if it maybe helps
us never know not sure because those

5240
02:33:18,830 --> 02:33:18,840
us never know not sure because those
 

5241
02:33:18,840 --> 02:33:21,190
us never know not sure because those
would be growing so far

5242
02:33:21,190 --> 02:33:21,200
would be growing so far
 

5243
02:33:21,200 --> 02:33:24,349
would be growing so far

5251
02:33:35,319 --> 02:33:37,070
oh no no wait I think isn't there is
there a checkpoint there

5252
02:33:37,070 --> 02:33:37,080
there a checkpoint there
 

5253
02:33:37,080 --> 02:33:41,389
there a checkpoint there
too oh man yeah there is

5254

then down with some momentum it might

5302
02:34:54,269 --> 02:34:54,279
then down with some momentum it might
 

5303
02:34:54,279 --> 02:34:57,590
then down with some momentum it might
actually yeah if we clim yeah it does it

5304
02:34:57,590 --> 02:34:57,600
actually yeah if we clim yeah it does it
 

5305
02:34:57,600 --> 02:35:02,269
actually yeah if we clim yeah it does it
connects it does yes wow all right all

5306

5313
02:35:10,359 --> 02:35:12,630

come probably enough if we just grow

5314
02:35:12,630 --> 02:35:12,640
come probably enough if we just grow
 

5315
02:35:12,640 --> 02:35:15,190
come probably enough if we just grow
this tree then if it's connec or maybe

5316
02:35:15,190 --> 02:35:15,200
this tree then if it's connec or maybe
 

5317
02:35:15,200 --> 02:35:16,790
this tree then if it's connec or maybe
we need all of them cuz honestly it was

5318
02:35:16,790 --> 02:35:16,800
we need all of them cuz honestly it was
 

5319
02:35:16,800 --> 02:35:20,110
we need all of them cuz honestly it was
really complicated to get the other C

5320
02:35:20,110 --> 02:35:20,120
really complicated to get the other C
 

5321
02:35:20,120 --> 02:35:23,030
really complicated to get the other C
the V vinyl yeah so maybe if we jump

5322
02:35:23,030 --> 02:35:23,040
the V vinyl yeah so maybe if we jump
 

5323
02:35:23,040 --> 02:35:24,429
the V vinyl yeah so maybe if we jump
from One Tree to the other tree to the

5324
02:35:24,429 --> 02:35:24,439
from One Tree to the other tree to the
 

5325
02:35:24,439 --> 02:35:27,790
from One Tree to the other tree to the
other tree yeah you know we'll bring it

5326
02:35:27,790 --> 02:35:27,800
other tree yeah you know we'll bring it
 

5327
02:35:27,800 --> 02:35:30,590
other tree yeah you know we'll bring it
over here

5328
02:35:30,590 --> 02:35:30,600

 

5329
02:35:30,600 --> 02:35:33,150

because you might need yeah oh oh you

5330
02:35:33,150 --> 02:35:33,160
because you might need yeah oh oh you
 

5331
02:35:33,160 --> 02:35:35,510
because you might need yeah oh oh you
think that's it finished growing this

5332
02:35:35,510 --> 02:35:35,520
think that's it finished growing this
 

5333
02:35:35,520 --> 02:35:37,910
think that's it finished growing this
one I feel like it I might have wait

5334
02:35:37,910 --> 02:35:37,920
one I feel like it I might have wait
 

5335
02:35:37,920 --> 02:35:39,870
one I feel like it I might have wait
where where it connects though are you

5336
02:35:39,870 --> 02:35:39,880
where where it connects though are you
 

5337
02:35:39,880 --> 02:35:42,070
where where it connects though are you
sure at the top if you come over to

5338
02:35:42,070 --> 02:35:42,080
sure at the top if you come over to
 

5339
02:35:42,080 --> 02:35:43,870
sure at the top if you come over to
where we are you can see that the tree

5340
02:35:43,870 --> 02:35:43,880
where we are you can see that the tree
 

5341
02:35:43,880 --> 02:35:45,750
where we are you can see that the tree
is reaching out to the other tree and

5342
02:35:45,750 --> 02:35:45,760
is reaching out to the other tree and
 

5343
02:35:45,760 --> 02:35:47,630
is reaching out to the other tree and
you could probably make that

5344
02:35:47,630 --> 02:35:47,640
you could probably make that
 

5345
02:35:47,640 --> 02:35:54,990
you could probably make that
jump okay m

5346
02:35:54,990 --> 02:35:55,000

 

5347
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:59,910
