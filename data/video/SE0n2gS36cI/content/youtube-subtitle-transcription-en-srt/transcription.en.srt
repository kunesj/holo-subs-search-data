do realize that some of our girls have
 

1047
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,430
do realize that some of our girls have
some issues with that like because they

1048
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:23,440
some issues with that like because they
 

1049
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,269
some issues with that like because they
don't know many japanese songs and and

1050
