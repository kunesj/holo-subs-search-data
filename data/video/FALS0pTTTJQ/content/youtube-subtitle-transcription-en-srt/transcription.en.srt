that's uh one two three four boxes
 

1091
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,389
that's uh one two three four boxes
or i could go here and then finish that

1092
00:30:56,389 --> 00:30:56,399
or i could go here and then finish that
 

1093
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:57,909

01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:05,430
numbers and card values and [\h__\h] you
just i need to look at the number

2866
01:14:05,430 --> 01:14:05,440
just i need to look at the number
 

2867
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:08,790
just i need to look at the number
at the corners of the cards and you try

2868
01:14:08,790 --> 01:14:08,800
at the corners of the cards and you try
 

2869
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:11,030
at the corners of the cards and you try
to get the number 21

2870
01:14:11,030 --> 01:14:11,040
to get the number 21
 

2871
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:13,510
to get the number 21
and not a buff if you if you get a

2872
01:14:13,510 --> 01:14:13,520
and not a buff if you if you get a
 

2873
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:15,189
and not a buff if you if you get a
number that's above

2874
01:14:15,189 --> 01:14:15,199
number that's above
 

2875
01:14:15,199 --> 01:14:16,870
number that's above
like if you add up your cards like for

2876
01:14:16,870 --> 01:14:16,880
like if you add up your cards like for
 

2877
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:18,870
like if you add up your cards like for
example you get a four in the beginning

2878
01:14:18,870 --> 01:14:18,880
example you get a four in the beginning
 

2879
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:21,910
example you get a four in the beginning
and then you choose to stack up on that

2880
01:14:21,910 --> 01:14:21,920
and then you choose to stack up on that
 

2881
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:24,950
and then you choose to stack up on that
but uh i think the highest stack that

2882
01:14:24,950 --> 01:14:24,960
but uh i think the highest stack that
 

2883
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,709
but uh i think the highest stack that
you can get is like a number and a

2884
01:14:26,709 --> 01:14:26,719
you can get is like a number and a
 

2885
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:28,070
you can get is like a number and a
number 10

2886
01:14:28,070 --> 01:14:28,080
number 10
 

2887
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:29,350
number 10
i don't think there's anything bigger

2888
01:14:29,350 --> 01:14:29,360
i don't think there's anything bigger
 

2889
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:31,990
i don't think there's anything bigger
than that so then you would get to 14

2890
01:14:31,990 --> 01:14:32,000
than that so then you would get to 14
 

2891
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,110
than that so then you would get to 14
and then you have to decide are you

2892
01:14:33,110 --> 01:14:33,120
and then you have to decide are you
 

2893
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:35,270
and then you have to decide are you
going to stack up again

2894
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:35,280
going to stack up again
 

2895
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:36,950
going to stack up again
yeah probably because you want to get to

2896
01:14:36,950 --> 01:14:36,960
yeah probably because you want to get to
 

2897
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:38,950
yeah probably because you want to get to
21. but then it could happen that you

2898
01:14:38,950 --> 01:14:38,960
21. but then it could happen that you
 

2899
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:40,310
21. but then it could happen that you
get to 24

2900
01:14:40,310 --> 01:14:40,320
get to 24
 

2901
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:43,510
get to 24
and then you bust it oh you can't go

2902
01:14:43,510 --> 01:14:43,520
and then you bust it oh you can't go
 

2903
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:45,830
and then you bust it oh you can't go
over you can go well but you're not

2904
01:14:45,830 --> 01:14:45,840
over you can go well but you're not
 

2905
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:46,709
over you can go well but you're not
supposed to

supposed to
you should try to get um 21 that's

2908
01:14:49,669 --> 01:14:49,679
you should try to get um 21 that's
