and also

4770
01:56:59,910 --> 01:56:59,920
and also
 

4771
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:02,229
and also
the tickets were already sold out when i

4772
01:57:02,229 --> 01:57:02,239
the tickets were already sold out when i
 

4773
01:57:02,239 --> 01:57:04,550
the tickets were already sold out when i
was announced so it's not like kfb was

4774
01:57:04,550 --> 01:57:04,560
was announced so it's not like kfb was
 

4775
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:06,709
was announced so it's not like kfb was
able to store and document for me

4776
01:57:06,709 --> 01:57:06,719
able to store and document for me
 

4777
01:57:06,719 --> 01:57:09,589
able to store and document for me
because they couldn't even buy a ticket

4778
01:57:09,589 --> 01:57:09,599
because they couldn't even buy a ticket
 

4779
01:57:09,599 --> 01:57:12,070
because they couldn't even buy a ticket
that's why i was worried

4780
01:57:12,070 --> 01:57:12,080
that's why i was worried
 

4781
01:57:12,080 --> 01:57:13,910
that's why i was worried
if if there were still some tickets and

4782
01:57:13,910 --> 01:57:13,920
if if there were still some tickets and
 

4783
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:15,990
if if there were still some tickets and
a lot more kfc people would have been

4784
01:57:15,990 --> 01:57:16,000
a lot more kfc people would have been
 

4785
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:17,990
a lot more kfc people would have been
able to join but there were no tickets

4786
01:57:17,990 --> 01:57:18,000
able to join but there were no tickets
 

4787
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:21,189
able to join but there were no tickets
so it was basically i had to rely on the
