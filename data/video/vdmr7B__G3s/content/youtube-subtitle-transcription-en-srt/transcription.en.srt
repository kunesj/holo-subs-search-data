forward to seeing then how because I I

1830
00:44:08,089 --> 00:44:08,099
forward to seeing then how because I I
 

1831
00:44:08,099 --> 00:44:09,589
forward to seeing then how because I I
haven't read the book so I don't know

1832
00:44:09,589 --> 00:44:09,599
haven't read the book so I don't know
 

1833
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,690
haven't read the book so I don't know
what happens going forward so then I'm

1834
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:11,700
what happens going forward so then I'm
 

1835
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:14,210
what happens going forward so then I'm
curious because obviously things changed

1836
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:14,220
curious because obviously things changed
 

1837
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,589
curious because obviously things changed
like I knew from the beginning that I

1838
00:44:15,589 --> 00:44:15,599
like I knew from the beginning that I
 

1839
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,150
like I knew from the beginning that I
liked Daenerys when I met her and then I

1840
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:17,160
liked Daenerys when I met her and then I
 

1841
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,589
liked Daenerys when I met her and then I
knew from the beginning and I feel like

1842
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:18,599
knew from the beginning and I feel like
 

1843
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:20,569
knew from the beginning and I feel like
that also gives me bias towards Venera

1844
00:44:20,569 --> 00:44:20,579
that also gives me bias towards Venera
 

1845
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:23,329
that also gives me bias towards Venera
because she's also a Targaryen and so

1846
00:44:23,329 --> 00:44:23,339
because she's also a Targaryen and so
 

1847
00:44:23,339 --> 00:44:26,809
because she's also a Targaryen and so
I'm like let's go Queen a fight you know

1848
00:44:26,809 --> 00:44:26,819
I'm like let's go Queen a fight you know
 

1849
00:44:26,819 --> 00:44:28,670
I'm like let's go Queen a fight you know
um because I'm like oh my God it's like

1850
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:28,680
um because I'm like oh my God it's like
 

1851
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,770
um because I'm like oh my God it's like
Daenerys 2.0 but like they they do have

1852
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:30,780
Daenerys 2.0 but like they they do have
 

1853
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:32,870
Daenerys 2.0 but like they they do have
a lot of differences

1854
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:32,880
a lot of differences
 

1855
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,990
a lot of differences
um but uh so I think

1856
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:36,000
um but uh so I think
 

1857
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,569
um but uh so I think
I think I'm curious again to see how

1858
00:44:38,569 --> 00:44:38,579
I think I'm curious again to see how
 

1859
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:41,150
I think I'm curious again to see how
it's going to change especially with

1860
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:41,160
it's going to change especially with
 

1861
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,589
it's going to change especially with
like a lot of the things that are going

1862
00:44:42,589 --> 00:44:42,599
like a lot of the things that are going
 

1863

1867
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:51,230

take like two years until the next

1870
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:52,920
take like two years until the next
 

1871
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,470
take like two years until the next
season and I don't I don't remember

1872
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:54,480
season and I don't I don't remember
 

1873
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,690

01:05:14,450 --> 01:05:14,460
in tune they didn't do that for this
 

2842
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:17,150
in tune they didn't do that for this
movie they actually did it backwards so

2843
01:05:17,150 --> 01:05:17,160
movie they actually did it backwards so
 

2844
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:18,950
movie they actually did it backwards so
they'd have a few different tracks that

2845
01:05:18,950 --> 01:05:18,960
they'd have a few different tracks that
 

2846
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:21,289
they'd have a few different tracks that
they could switch switch through and

2847
01:05:21,289 --> 01:05:21,299
they could switch switch through and
 

2848
01:05:21,299 --> 01:05:22,970
they could switch switch through and
they'd basically just let the performers

2849
01:05:22,970 --> 01:05:22,980
they'd basically just let the performers
 

2850
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:24,950
they'd basically just let the performers
go in and do whatever and change the the

2851
01:05:24,950 --> 01:05:24,960
go in and do whatever and change the the
 

2852
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,690
go in and do whatever and change the the
tempo and stuff so that the singing was

2853
01:05:26,690 --> 01:05:26,700
tempo and stuff so that the singing was
 

2854
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:28,910

Live recorded which you might think oh

2855
01:05:28,910 --> 01:05:28,920
Live recorded which you might think oh
 

2856
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:31,309
Live recorded which you might think oh
that's really cool but the issue is what

2857
01:05:31,309 --> 01:05:31,319
that's really cool but the issue is what
 

2858
01:05:31,319 --> 01:05:32,930
that's really cool but the issue is what
they did is then they would make the

2859
01:05:32,930 --> 01:05:32,940
they did is then they would make the
 

2860
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:34,910
they did is then they would make the
orchestra come back in

2861
01:05:34,910 --> 01:05:34,920
orchestra come back in
 

2862
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:37,329
orchestra come back in
and then have to record

2863
01:05:37,329 --> 01:05:37,339
and then have to record
 

2864
01:05:37,339 --> 01:05:40,270
and then have to record
with and match the singer's vocals

2865
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:40,280
with and match the singer's vocals
 

2866
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:42,890
with and match the singer's vocals
instead of having the singers work with

2867
01:05:42,890 --> 01:05:42,900
instead of having the singers work with
 

2868
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:44,750
instead of having the singers work with
the orchestra so for example I'll use

2869
01:05:44,750 --> 01:05:44,760
the orchestra so for example I'll use
 

2870
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:47,329
the orchestra so for example I'll use

think

5820
02:07:02,209 --> 02:07:02,219
think
 

5821
02:07:02,219 --> 02:07:04,430
think
the results are in

5822
02:07:04,430 --> 02:07:04,440
the results are in
 

5823
02:07:04,440 --> 02:07:06,589
the results are in
um oh I need I need to calculate it real

5824
02:07:06,589 --> 02:07:06,599
um oh I need I need to calculate it real
 

5825
02:07:06,599 --> 02:07:07,850
um oh I need I need to calculate it real
quick so just give me okay you'll

5826
02:07:07,850 --> 02:07:07,860
quick so just give me okay you'll
 

5827
02:07:07,860 --> 02:07:10,010
quick so just give me okay you'll
calculate and then I'm gonna because I

5828
02:07:10,010 --> 02:07:10,020
calculate and then I'm gonna because I
 

5829
02:07:10,020 --> 02:07:11,510
calculate and then I'm gonna because I
have to calculate it I actually have to

5830
02:07:11,510 --> 02:07:11,520
have to calculate it I actually have to
 

5831
02:07:11,520 --> 02:07:14,149
have to calculate it I actually have to
turn the screen off for you guys that's

5832
02:07:14,149 --> 02:07:14,159
turn the screen off for you guys that's
 

5833
02:07:14,159 --> 02:07:15,290
turn the screen off for you guys that's
fine

5834
02:07:15,290 --> 02:07:15,300
fine
 

5835
02:07:15,300 --> 02:07:18,530
fine
um build up the anticipation a little

5836
02:07:18,530 --> 02:07:18,540
um build up the anticipation a little
 

5837
02:07:18,540 --> 02:07:20,570
um build up the anticipation a little
bit

5838
02:07:20,570 --> 02:07:20,580
bit
 

5839
02:07:20,580 --> 02:07:25,129
bit
um well oh none of us here can count so

5840
02:07:25,129 --> 02:07:25,139
um well oh none of us here can count so
 

5841
02:07:25,139 --> 02:07:27,169
um well oh none of us here can count so
we are already into all really

5842
02:07:27,169 --> 02:07:27,179
we are already into all really
 

5843
02:07:27,179 --> 02:07:29,030
we are already into all really
anticipating the results none of us

5844
02:07:29,030 --> 02:07:29,040
anticipating the results none of us
 

5845
02:07:29,040 --> 02:07:32,030
anticipating the results none of us
could ever guess how this will go I

5846
02:07:32,030 --> 02:07:32,040
could ever guess how this will go I
 

5847
02:07:32,040 --> 02:07:35,689
could ever guess how this will go I
can't count for one so but I think maybe

5848
02:07:35,689 --> 02:07:35,699
can't count for one so but I think maybe
 

5849
02:07:35,699 --> 02:07:38,510
can't count for one so but I think maybe
there's a slight chance that we are over

5850
02:07:38,510 --> 02:07:38,520
there's a slight chance that we are over
 

5851
02:07:38,520 --> 02:07:42,709
there's a slight chance that we are over
all overly compatible yeah yeah as we've

5852
02:07:42,709 --> 02:07:42,719
all overly compatible yeah yeah as we've
 

5853
02:07:42,719 --> 02:07:44,990
all overly compatible yeah yeah as we've
already known it because we get we got

5854
02:07:44,990 --> 02:07:45,000
already known it because we get we got
 

5855
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,510
already known it because we get we got
surprised so many times when we're

5856
02:07:47,510 --> 02:07:47,520
surprised so many times when we're
 

5857
02:07:47,520 --> 02:07:49,550
surprised so many times when we're
talking to each other in the past days

5858
02:07:49,550 --> 02:07:49,560
talking to each other in the past days
 

5859
02:07:49,560 --> 02:07:51,890
talking to each other in the past days
yeah and then every time a new thing

5860
02:07:51,890 --> 02:07:51,900
yeah and then every time a new thing
 

5861
02:07:51,900 --> 02:07:54,470
yeah and then every time a new thing
comes up I'm like what

5862
02:07:54,470 --> 02:07:54,480
comes up I'm like what
 

5863
02:07:54,480 --> 02:07:55,930
comes up I'm like what

were stricken
with the 69s

5888
02:08:25,790 --> 02:08:25,800

 

5889
02:08:25,800 --> 02:08:30,649

there will be even more agreements in
the future exactly this was this was

5952
02:09:55,669 --> 02:09:55,679
the future exactly this was this was
 

5953

testing so we'll have to we'll just have
 

5963
02:10:05,760 --> 02:10:07,370
testing so we'll have to we'll just have
to do more of these again in private

5964
02:10:07,370 --> 02:10:07,380
to do more of these again in private
 

5965

02:10:11,030 --> 02:10:11,040
five percent
 

5969
02:10:11,040 --> 02:10:13,250
