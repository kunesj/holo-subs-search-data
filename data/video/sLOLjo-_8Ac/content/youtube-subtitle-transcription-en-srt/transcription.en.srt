302
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:32,040

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,470
too hot anyway I can't drink it after 3
minutes so we're going to set it aside I

306
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:35,480
minutes so we're going to set it aside I
 

307
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,870

guess put that aside what would be smart
 

309
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,269

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,509

with we're going to start with

340
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:51,519
with we're going to start with
 

341
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,030
with we're going to start with
honey the reason why is because then I

342
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,040
honey the reason why is because then I
 

343
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,829
honey the reason why is because then I
can afterwards put the put it into the

can afterwards put the put it into the
 

345
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:04,069
can afterwards put the put it into the
tea

346
00:13:04,069 --> 00:13:04,079

 

347
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,110

okay the honey difference is actually

348
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:08,120
okay the honey difference is actually
 

349
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,750
okay the honey difference is actually
insane it hurt my wallet a bit to buy

350
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:11,760
insane it hurt my wallet a bit to buy
 

351
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,910
insane it hurt my wallet a bit to buy
this one so the cheap one is per

352
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:14,920
this one so the cheap one is per
 

353
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,230
this one so the cheap one is per
kilogram the actual thing didn't cost as

354
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:17,240
kilogram the actual thing didn't cost as
 

355
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,710
kilogram the actual thing didn't cost as
much of course but the only real way to

356
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:21,720
much of course but the only real way to
 

357
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,110
much of course but the only real way to
um differentiate the prices properly I

358
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:24,120
um differentiate the prices properly I
 

359
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,430
um differentiate the prices properly I
thought is going by kilogram liter price

360
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:26,440
thought is going by kilogram liter price
 

361
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,990
thought is going by kilogram liter price
Etc so the cheap one is this and the

362
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:29,000
Etc so the cheap one is this and the
 

363
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,430
Etc so the cheap one is this and the
expensive one

364
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:32,440

 

365
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,509

is 10 times the price

366
00:13:36,509 --> 00:13:36,519
is 10 times the price
 

367
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:40,069
is 10 times the price
111 why because one of this is

368
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:40,079
111 why because one of this is
 

369
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,629
111 why because one of this is

the bottom is actually kind of flat um
so we had to cut it a little bit my

00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:33,950
um is 0.19 versus the
expensive

1682
00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:33,960

5.84 water don't know which one is which

1684
00:47:37,829 --> 00:47:37,839
5.84 water don't know which one is which
 

1685
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:41,829
5.84 water don't know which one is which
but um one big reason why this is

1686
00:47:41,829 --> 00:47:41,839
but um one big reason why this is
 

1687
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:45,630
but um one big reason why this is
expensive I can already

1688
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:45,640

 

1689
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:48,870

tell uh you guys but I still think even

1690
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:48,880
tell uh you guys but I still think even
 

1691
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,670
tell uh you guys but I still think even
without it would be probably up there

1692
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:51,680
without it would be probably up there
 

1693
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:57,589
without it would be probably up there
cuz it's just uh conceited water

1694
00:47:57,589 --> 00:47:57,599
cuz it's just uh conceited water
 

1695
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:59,710
cuz it's just uh conceited water
is because it's the boss water that

1696
00:47:59,710 --> 00:47:59,720
is because it's the boss water that
 

1697
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:02,910
is because it's the boss water that
comes in a glass bottle right which is

1698
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:02,920
comes in a glass bottle right which is

00:50:42,599 --> 00:50:46,990
how my dreams were feeling
like it it's like so long ago but that

1800
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:47,000
like it it's like so long ago but that
 

1801
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,870
like it it's like so long ago but that
stayed in my brain so strongly because

1802
00:50:49,870 --> 00:50:49,880
stayed in my brain so strongly because
 

1803
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:54,150
stayed in my brain so strongly because
of that feeling of the aluminum

1804
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:54,160

 

1805
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:59,069

foil yeah so this reminds me of my

1806
00:50:59,069 --> 00:50:59,079
foil yeah so this reminds me of my
 

1807
00:50:59,079 --> 00:51:02,870
foil yeah so this reminds me of my
nightmares and this

1808
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:02,880

 

1809
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,750

doesn't so but the fact that this

1810
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:05,760
doesn't so but the fact that this
 

1811
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:09,470
doesn't so but the fact that this
probably over this one hour kept More

1812
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:09,480
probably over this one hour kept More
 

1813
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:12,549
probably over this one hour kept More
sparkliness Than This One did unless it

1814
00:51:12,549 --> 00:51:12,559
sparkliness Than This One did unless it
 

1815
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:14,549
sparkliness Than This One did unless it
already came unless one of them already

1816
00:51:14,549 --> 00:51:14,559
already came unless one of them already
 

1817
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:17,230
already came unless one of them already
came with less strong

1818
00:51:17,230 --> 00:51:17,240
came with less strong
 

1819
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,829
came with less strong
sparkliness um then that's another story

1820
00:51:19,829 --> 00:51:19,839
sparkliness um then that's another story
 

1821
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:21,430
sparkliness um then that's another story
but let's assume they're pretty much

1822
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:21,440
but let's assume they're pretty much
 

1823
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,950
but let's assume they're pretty much
both very sparkly and this this one lost

1824
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:24,960
both very sparkly and this this one lost
 

1825
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:30,549
both very sparkly and this this one lost
more and this one had did

um it looks nice and clean but it looks
cheap and the the shape of the

3330
01:30:29,990 --> 01:30:30,000

3381
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:40,470

non-cotton part of it um but it's mostly

3382
01:31:40,470 --> 01:31:40,480
non-cotton part of it um but it's mostly
 

3383
