back and I was in the middle of nowhere
 

193
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,570
back and I was in the middle of nowhere
and now I am traversing in the Never

194
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:35,580
and now I am traversing in the Never
 

195
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,750
and now I am traversing in the Never
back to home I am safe more or less I

196
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:38,760
back to home I am safe more or less I
 

197
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,910
back to home I am safe more or less I
just forgot I was in the Never

198
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:40,920
just forgot I was in the Never

really I never found a cave though so

200
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:43,740
really I never found a cave though so
 

201
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,009
really I never found a cave though so

we'll find one together
 

203
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:49,370
we'll find one together
so we can probably find it on like in

204
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:49,380
so we can probably find it on like in
 

205
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,070
