sometimes when um when I when I want to
go faster um what gears

5130
03:18:19,189 --> 03:18:19,199
go faster um what gears
 

5131
03:18:19,199 --> 03:18:21,910
go faster um what gears
for um it's like

5132
03:18:21,910 --> 03:18:21,920
for um it's like
 

5133
03:18:21,920 --> 03:18:25,510
for um it's like
so uh have you rode a bike before yeah

5134

so uh have you rode a bike before yeah
 

5135
03:18:25,520 --> 03:18:28,150
so uh have you rode a bike before yeah
with gears so yeah when you're on like

5136
03:18:28,150 --> 03:18:28,160
with gears so yeah when you're on like
 

5137
03:18:28,160 --> 03:18:30,269
with gears so yeah when you're on like
gear one it'll be like a lot harder to

5138
03:18:30,269 --> 03:18:30,279
gear one it'll be like a lot harder to
 

5139
03:18:30,279 --> 03:18:32,750
gear one it'll be like a lot harder to
Pedal right so you go slower so imagine

5140
03:18:32,750 --> 03:18:32,760
Pedal right so you go slower so imagine
 

5141
03:18:32,760 --> 03:18:35,990
Pedal right so you go slower so imagine
it like that and then when you're on

5142
03:18:35,990 --> 03:18:36,000
it like that and then when you're on
 

5143
03:18:36,000 --> 03:18:38,070
it like that and then when you're on
like the fifth or sixth gear it becomes

5144
03:18:38,070 --> 03:18:38,080
like the fifth or sixth gear it becomes
 

5145
03:18:38,080 --> 03:18:40,910
like the fifth or sixth gear it becomes
a lot

5146

easier oh so it goes it's like looser so
 

5149
03:18:43,840 --> 03:18:46,010
easier oh so it goes it's like looser so
it goes faster yeah

5150
03:18:46,010 --> 03:18:46,020

5523
03:31:21,000 --> 03:31:23,670

and

5524
03:31:23,670 --> 03:31:23,680

5528
03:31:30,790 --> 03:31:30,800
but there was this one time where like
 

5529
03:31:30,800 --> 03:31:34,189
but there was this one time where like
we got a random racing game and I wasn't

5531
03:31:34,199 --> 03:31:39,630

really into it so I let Dad SEI try and

5532
03:31:39,630 --> 03:31:39,640
really into it so I let Dad SEI try and
 

5533
03:31:39,640 --> 03:31:42,910
really into it so I let Dad SEI try and
then he would just play
