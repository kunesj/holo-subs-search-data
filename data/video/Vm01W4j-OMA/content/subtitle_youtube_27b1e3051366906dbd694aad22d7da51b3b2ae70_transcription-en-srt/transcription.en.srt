fish so there's a reason why it was mid

9174
04:21:36,349 --> 04:21:36,359
fish so there's a reason why it was mid
 

9175
04:21:36,359 --> 04:21:38,269
fish so there's a reason why it was mid
and it's such a simple reason is because

9176
04:21:38,269 --> 04:21:38,279
and it's such a simple reason is because
 

9177
04:21:38,279 --> 04:21:40,950
and it's such a simple reason is because
I didn't just um I did I I I I barely

9178
04:21:40,950 --> 04:21:40,960
I didn't just um I did I I I I barely
 

9179

I didn't just um I did I I I I barely
salted it

9180
04:21:43,429 --> 04:21:43,439
salted it
 

9181
04:21:43,439 --> 04:21:46,870
salted it
and the second day I ate it I salted it

9182
04:21:46,870 --> 04:21:46,880
and the second day I ate it I salted it
 

9183
04:21:46,880 --> 04:21:48,870
and the second day I ate it I salted it
more and then it was

9184
04:21:48,870 --> 04:21:48,880
more and then it was
 

9185
04:21:48,880 --> 04:21:51,429
more and then it was
fine that was all it took but the reason

9186
04:21:51,429 --> 04:21:51,439
fine that was all it took but the reason
 

9187
04:21:51,439 --> 04:21:53,030
fine that was all it took but the reason
there's a reason why I didn't salt it so

9188
04:21:53,030 --> 04:21:53,040
there's a reason why I didn't salt it so
 

9189
04:21:53,040 --> 04:21:55,229
there's a reason why I didn't salt it so
much initially it's because I

9190
04:21:55,229 --> 04:21:55,239
much initially it's because I
 

9191

oopsie yeah cuz I think for that it was
kind of important to me I don't know I

11940
05:36:02,750 --> 05:36:02,760
kind of important to me I don't know I
 

11941
05:36:02,760 --> 05:36:05,350
kind of important to me I don't know I
didn't want to cuz I think the even the

11942
05:36:05,350 --> 05:36:05,360
didn't want to cuz I think the even the
 

11943
05:36:05,360 --> 05:36:16,548
didn't want to cuz I think the even the
online tickets were kind of expensive so

11944
05:36:16,548 --> 05:36:16,558

 

11945
05:36:16,558 --> 05:36:19,110

be so
cool I wonder I feel like it would be

11950
05:36:23,150 --> 05:36:23,160
cool I wonder I feel like it would be
 

11951
05:36:23,160 --> 05:36:24,990
cool I wonder I feel like it would be
cool if we go to a new city each time

11952
05:36:24,990 --> 05:36:25,000
cool if we go to a new city each time
 

11953
05:36:25,000 --> 05:36:27,628
cool if we go to a new city each time
but somehow I feel like they might just

11954
05:36:27,628 --> 05:36:27,638
but somehow I feel like they might just
 

11955
05:36:27,638 --> 05:36:30,548
but somehow I feel like they might just
go back to

11956
05:36:30,548 --> 05:36:30,558

 

11957
05:36:30,558 --> 05:36:33,430

LA but I really don't know I don't know

11958
05:36:33,430 --> 05:36:33,440
LA but I really don't know I don't know
 

11959
05:36:33,440 --> 05:36:36,788
LA but I really don't know I don't know
but that's the maybe like in my brain my

11960
05:36:36,788 --> 05:36:36,798
but that's the maybe like in my brain my
 

11961
05:36:36,798 --> 05:36:39,590
but that's the maybe like in my brain my
brain wors at telling me if they're lazy

11962
05:36:39,590 --> 05:36:39,600
brain wors at telling me if they're lazy
 

11963
05:36:39,600 --> 05:36:42,350
brain wors at telling me if they're lazy
they'll just go back to LA or not not if

11964
05:36:42,350 --> 05:36:42,360
they'll just go back to LA or not not if
 

11965
05:36:42,360 --> 05:36:45,110
they'll just go back to LA or not not if
they're lazy that's not really what it's

11966
05:36:45,110 --> 05:36:45,120
they're lazy that's not really what it's
 

11967
05:36:45,120 --> 05:36:46,990
they're lazy that's not really what it's
about but maybe it's just easier to get

11968
05:36:46,990 --> 05:36:47,000
about but maybe it's just easier to get
 

11969
05:36:47,000 --> 05:36:54,628
about but maybe it's just easier to get
venues there and I don't

11970
05:36:54,628 --> 05:36:54,638

 

11971
05:36:54,638 --> 05:36:57,390

know and it's probably also like

11972
05:36:57,390 --> 05:36:57,400
know and it's probably also like
 

11973
05:36:57,400 --> 05:36:58,670
know and it's probably also like
something they always keep in mind

11974
05:36:58,670 --> 05:36:58,680
something they always keep in mind
 

11975
05:36:58,680 --> 05:37:00,310
something they always keep in mind
probably is events like Anime

11976
05:37:00,310 --> 05:37:00,320
probably is events like Anime
 

11977
05:37:00,320 --> 05:37:01,868
probably is events like Anime
conventions kind of

11978
05:37:01,868 --> 05:37:01,878
conventions kind of
 

11979
05:37:01,878 --> 05:37:04,470
conventions kind of
like timing it with the Anime

11980
05:37:04,470 --> 05:37:04,480
like timing it with the Anime
 

11981
05:37:04,480 --> 05:37:07,628
like timing it with the Anime
conventions but honestly it was really

11982
05:37:07,628 --> 05:37:07,638
conventions but honestly it was really
 

11983
05:37:07,638 --> 05:37:09,548
conventions but honestly it was really
hard like I I wanted to do something for

11984
05:37:09,548 --> 05:37:09,558
hard like I I wanted to do something for
