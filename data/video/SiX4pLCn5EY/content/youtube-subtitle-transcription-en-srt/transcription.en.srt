and adam i think
 

7011
02:50:30,479 --> 02:50:32,070
and adam i think
i think

7012
02:50:32,070 --> 02:50:32,080
i think
 

7013
02:50:32,080 --> 02:50:35,750
i think
because uh e is just the one the one

7014
02:50:35,750 --> 02:50:35,760
because uh e is just the one the one
 

7015
02:50:35,760 --> 02:50:37,590
because uh e is just the one the one
straight one

7016
02:50:37,590 --> 02:50:37,600
straight one
 

7017
02:50:37,600 --> 02:50:40,230
straight one
and

7018
02:50:40,230 --> 02:50:40,240

 

7019
02:50:40,240 --> 02:50:42,870

because you combine the k and the e

7020
02:50:42,870 --> 02:50:42,880
because you combine the k and the e
 

7021
02:50:42,880 --> 02:50:45,910
because you combine the k and the e
so it's the the one that looks like

7022
02:50:45,910 --> 02:50:45,920
so it's the the one that looks like
 

7023
02:50:45,920 --> 02:50:47,349
so it's the the one that looks like
