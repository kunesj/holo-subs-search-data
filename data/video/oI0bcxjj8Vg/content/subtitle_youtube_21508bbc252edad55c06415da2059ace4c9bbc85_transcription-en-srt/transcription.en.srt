this course i forgot anything about

1626
00:43:35,829 --> 00:43:35,839
this course i forgot anything about
 

1627
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:38,309
this course i forgot anything about
physics to do that

1628
00:43:38,309 --> 00:43:38,319
physics to do that
 

1629
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:40,470
physics to do that
i will teach you if you look at this

1630
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:40,480
i will teach you if you look at this

right yeah um let's see you fall humans

1636
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:48,560
right yeah um let's see you fall humans
 

1637
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,390

shut up goddess

i'm teaching my child something

1640
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:55,680

 

1641
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,470

let's say you fall out of that portal

1642
00:43:58,470 --> 00:43:58,480
let's say you fall out of that portal
 

1643
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,150
let's say you fall out of that portal
as a pup

1644
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:00,160
as a pup
 

1645
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,309
as a pup
and then you you you fall into that

1646
00:44:02,309 --> 00:44:02,319
and then you you you fall into that
 

1647
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:04,550
and then you you you fall into that
portal down here

1648
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:04,560
portal down here
 

1649
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:05,349
portal down here
um

1650
00:44:05,349 --> 00:44:05,359
um
 

1651
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:07,510
um
that is called

1652
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:07,520
that is called
 

1653
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,870
that is called
momentum and the higher you fall

1654
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:10,880
momentum and the higher you fall
 

1655
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,910
momentum and the higher you fall
the more

1656
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:11,920
the more
 

1657
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,710
the more
um like like okay wait no let's say you

1658
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:14,720
um like like okay wait no let's say you
 

1659
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,349
um like like okay wait no let's say you
fall out of here and you fall into this

1660
00:44:17,349 --> 00:44:17,359
fall out of here and you fall into this
 

1661
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:20,550
fall out of here and you fall into this
one yeah let's say if it was a big fall

1662
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:20,560
one yeah let's say if it was a big fall
 

1663
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:24,150
one yeah let's say if it was a big fall
then once you go through this portal

1664
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:24,160
then once you go through this portal
 

1665
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,109
then once you go through this portal
again yeah uh you will fall like this

1666
00:44:27,109 --> 00:44:27,119
again yeah uh you will fall like this
 

1667
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:27,910
again yeah uh you will fall like this
way

1668
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:27,920
way
 

1669
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,069
way
very very far away so that's called

1670
00:44:30,069 --> 00:44:30,079
very very far away so that's called
 

1671
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:37,570
very very far away so that's called
momentum okay perfect explanation

here we already have an example but oh
 

1683
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:56,630
here we already have an example but oh
cobo can you go down first

1684
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:56,640
cobo can you go down first
 

1685
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,109
cobo can you go down first
not into the portal yeah can you make um

1686
00:44:59,109 --> 00:44:59,119
not into the portal yeah can you make um
 

1687
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:02,829
not into the portal yeah can you make um
a blue portal where my yellow one

1688
00:45:02,829 --> 00:45:02,839
a blue portal where my yellow one
 

1689
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:06,230
a blue portal where my yellow one
is uh a dark blue portal

1690
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:06,240
is uh a dark blue portal
 

1691
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:10,630
is uh a dark blue portal
there where i can't read yeah over there

1693
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:14,710

okay and now i show you momentum

1694
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:14,720
okay and now i show you momentum
 

1695
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,710

i am carrying my child and now you fall

1706
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:31,040
i am carrying my child and now you fall
 

1707
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,470
i am carrying my child and now you fall
and do the same thing fall for the

1708
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:32,480
and do the same thing fall for the
 

1709
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,790
and do the same thing fall for the
yellow ones i'll just fall momentum

1710
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:36,800
yellow ones i'll just fall momentum
 

1711
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:37,990

1723
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,270

uh-huh i see something here that's where

1724
00:46:01,270 --> 00:46:01,280
uh-huh i see something here that's where
 

1725

uh-huh i see something here that's where
we have to

1726

we have to
 

1727
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:09,510
we have to
fall through maybe

1728
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:09,520

 

1729
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,349

1734
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:14,400
aha
 

1735
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,430
aha
i'll go there too okay okay

1736
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:17,440
i'll go there too okay okay
 

1737
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,430
i'll go there too okay okay
so i think first of all

1738
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:21,440

 

1739
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,510

can you make um

1740
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:23,520
can you make um
 

1741
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,670
can you make um
a blue one here

1742
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:25,680
a blue one here
 

1743
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:26,710
a blue one here
blue

1744
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:26,720
blue
 

1745
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:30,470
blue
here and then one like somewhere uh high

1746
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:30,480
here and then one like somewhere uh high
 

1747
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:34,870
here and then one like somewhere uh high
ah this one this one this one okay okay

1748
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:34,880

 

1749
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,309

yeah i think

1750
00:46:36,309 --> 00:46:36,319
yeah i think
 

1751
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:39,030
yeah i think
let's see

1752
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:39,040

 

1753
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,550

1754
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:40,560

nice i pressed the button i don't know

1756
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:42,160
nice i pressed the button i don't know
 

1757
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,670
nice i pressed the button i don't know
what happened

1758
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:43,680
what happened
 

1759
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:47,750
