4217
02:04:41,580 --> 02:04:46,189
makes so much more sense doesn't it
now so they did that

4218
02:04:46,189 --> 02:04:46,199

 

4219
02:04:46,199 --> 02:04:50,930

02:04:50,930 --> 02:04:50,940

 

4221
02:04:50,940 --> 02:04:53,870

first time also there's like the

4222
02:04:53,870 --> 02:04:53,880
first time also there's like the
 

4223
02:04:53,880 --> 02:04:56,629
first time also there's like the
um from what's it called there's another

4224
02:04:56,629 --> 02:04:56,639
um from what's it called there's another
 

4225
02:04:56,639 --> 02:04:59,390
um from what's it called there's another
like sports game for the switch

4226
02:04:59,390 --> 02:04:59,400
like sports game for the switch
 

4227
02:04:59,400 --> 02:05:01,430
like sports game for the switch
but that's more like about like actual

4228
02:05:01,430 --> 02:05:01,440
but that's more like about like actual
 

4229
02:05:01,440 --> 02:05:04,189
but that's more like about like actual
sports right not like this kind of

4230
02:05:04,189 --> 02:05:04,199
sports right not like this kind of
 

4231
02:05:04,199 --> 02:05:06,470
sports right not like this kind of
exercise so at some point we can also

4232
02:05:06,470 --> 02:05:06,480
exercise so at some point we can also
 

4233
02:05:06,480 --> 02:05:08,810
exercise so at some point we can also
try that one out with 3D

4234
02:05:08,810 --> 02:05:08,820
try that one out with 3D
 

4235
02:05:08,820 --> 02:05:10,669
try that one out with 3D
and I also want to play like some like

4236
02:05:10,669 --> 02:05:10,679
and I also want to play like some like
 

4237
02:05:10,679 --> 02:05:12,709
and I also want to play like some like
rhythm dancing games or so if there's

4238
02:05:12,709 --> 02:05:12,719
rhythm dancing games or so if there's
 

4239
02:05:12,719 --> 02:05:14,830
rhythm dancing games or so if there's
like permissions

4240
02:05:14,830 --> 02:05:14,840
like permissions
 

4241
02:05:14,840 --> 02:05:17,570
like permissions
in 3D but that will look probably more

4242
02:05:17,570 --> 02:05:17,580
in 3D but that will look probably more
 

4243
02:05:17,580 --> 02:05:20,270
in 3D but that will look probably more
scuffed because once I start dancing it

4244
02:05:20,270 --> 02:05:20,280
scuffed because once I start dancing it
 

4245
02:05:20,280 --> 02:05:23,689
scuffed because once I start dancing it
looks more like [\h__\h] but we'll see we'll

4246
02:05:23,689 --> 02:05:23,699
looks more like [\h__\h] but we'll see we'll
 

4247
02:05:23,699 --> 02:05:25,609
looks more like [\h__\h] but we'll see we'll
see

that was two hours one of my shortest

4318
02:07:03,109 --> 02:07:03,119
that was two hours one of my shortest
 

4319
02:07:03,119 --> 02:07:05,750
that was two hours one of my shortest
streams but honestly I I thought it

4320
02:07:05,750 --> 02:07:05,760
streams but honestly I I thought it
 

4321
02:07:05,760 --> 02:07:09,050
streams but honestly I I thought it
would be one hour at most so

4322
02:07:09,050 --> 02:07:09,060
would be one hour at most so
 

4323
02:07:09,060 --> 02:07:14,149
would be one hour at most so
big [\h__\h] success I would say

4324
02:07:14,149 --> 02:07:14,159

 

4325
02:07:14,159 --> 02:07:15,709
