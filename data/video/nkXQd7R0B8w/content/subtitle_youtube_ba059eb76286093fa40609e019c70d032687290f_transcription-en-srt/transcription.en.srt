quadruplets double
 

1381
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,950
quadruplets double
amount not even I don't even think it

1382
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:19,960
amount not even I don't even think it
 

1383
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,630
amount not even I don't even think it
would be exactly a double because dogs I

1384
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:22,640
would be exactly a double because dogs I
 

1385
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,349
would be exactly a double because dogs I
feel like they bark more the more dogs

feel like they bark more the more dogs
are in the room and just because it's

1388
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:26,040
are in the room and just because it's
 

1389
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,870
are in the room and just because it's
double I don't think yeah I think it was

1390
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:27,880
double I don't think yeah I think it was
 

1391
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:31,790
double I don't think yeah I think it was
just like maybe like double point

1392
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:31,800
just like maybe like double point
 

1393
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:35,910
just like maybe like double point
something like it's not an even doublez

1394
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:35,920
something like it's not an even doublez
 

1395
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,190
something like it's not an even doublez
I think what if it's exponential like

1396
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:39,200
I think what if it's exponential like
 

1397
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,349
I think what if it's exponential like
yes x amount of dogs in the room yeah
