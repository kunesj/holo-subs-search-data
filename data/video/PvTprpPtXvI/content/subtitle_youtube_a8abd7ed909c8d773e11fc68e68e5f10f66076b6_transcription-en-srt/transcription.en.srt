like it would be perfect if we had it
straight here but it

2338
01:00:09,829 --> 01:00:09,839
straight here but it
 

2339
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:13,349
straight here but it
can only really go

2340
01:00:13,349 --> 01:00:13,359

 

2341
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:15,829

for example

2342
01:00:15,829 --> 01:00:15,839
for example
 

2343
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:18,470
for example
what does that do

2344
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:18,480
what does that do
 

2345
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,069

01:00:27,270 --> 01:00:27,280
comes out of there will it reach over
 

2351
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:29,589
comes out of there will it reach over
here no way

2352
01:00:29,589 --> 01:00:29,599
here no way
 

2353
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:32,870
here no way
what that reaches oh [\h__\h] it flies so

01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:32,880
what that reaches oh [\h__\h] it flies so
 

2355
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,470
what that reaches oh [\h__\h] it flies so
so like

2356
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:34,480
so like
 

2357
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:45,910
so like
huge distances

2358
01:00:45,910 --> 01:00:45,920

if we combine it with blue then i can
 

2385
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:24,950
if we combine it with blue then i can
because i was there like the distance

2386
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:24,960
because i was there like the distance
 

2387
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:27,349
because i was there like the distance
was enough but i just there was a fence

in the way so maybe if i get a little
 

2391
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:30,309
in the way so maybe if i get a little
bit of height

01:14:41,270 --> 01:14:41,280

 

2969
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:43,990

i hope i land on the blues though

2970
01:14:43,990 --> 01:14:44,000
i hope i land on the blues though
 

2971
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,510
i hope i land on the blues though
okay okay oh

2972
01:14:47,510 --> 01:14:47,520

 

2973
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:48,630

okay

2974
01:14:48,630 --> 01:14:48,640
okay
 

2975

nice

2978
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:53,600
nice
 

2979
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:54,709
nice
let's go

2980
01:14:54,709 --> 01:14:54,719
let's go
 

2981
01:14:54,719 --> 01:14:58,470
let's go
here oh

2982
01:14:58,470 --> 01:14:58,480

 

2983
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:00,070

oh

2984
01:15:00,070 --> 01:15:00,080
oh
 

2985
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:02,470
oh
oh that just happened in in like the the

2986
01:15:02,470 --> 01:15:02,480
oh that just happened in in like the the
 

2987
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:05,430
oh that just happened in in like the the
mini amount of time where i

2988
01:15:05,430 --> 01:15:05,440
mini amount of time where i
 

2989
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:08,229
mini amount of time where i
didn't place both portals but only one

2990
01:15:08,229 --> 01:15:08,239
didn't place both portals but only one
 

2991
01:15:08,239 --> 01:15:09,669
didn't place both portals but only one
because i don't remember putting blue on

2992
01:15:09,669 --> 01:15:09,679
because i don't remember putting blue on
 

2993
01:15:09,679 --> 01:15:10,630
because i don't remember putting blue on
here

2994
01:15:10,630 --> 01:15:10,640
here
 

2995
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:12,790
here
i think i want orange though ah no i

2996
01:15:12,790 --> 01:15:12,800

or yeah i want blue there yeah yeah yeah

3008
01:15:25,510 --> 01:15:25,520
or yeah i want blue there yeah yeah yeah
 

3009
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:26,950
or yeah i want blue there yeah yeah yeah
yeah

3010
01:15:26,950 --> 01:15:26,960
yeah
 

3011
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:28,550
yeah
i don't know what you're saying chad but

3012
01:15:28,550 --> 01:15:28,560
i don't know what you're saying chad but
 

3013
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:30,550
i don't know what you're saying chad but
i know that i know it so don't tell me

3014
01:15:30,550 --> 01:15:30,560
i know that i know it so don't tell me
 

3015
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:32,070
i know that i know it so don't tell me
anything

3016
01:15:32,070 --> 01:15:32,080
anything
 

3017
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:35,669
anything
it's okay i'm going through this um

3018
01:15:35,669 --> 01:15:35,679
it's okay i'm going through this um
 

3019
01:15:35,679 --> 01:15:38,470
it's okay i'm going through this um
so now i will uh

3020
01:15:38,470 --> 01:15:38,480
so now i will uh
 

3021
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:41,430
so now i will uh
put oh [\h__\h] i want all right i can

3022
01:15:41,430 --> 01:15:41,440
put oh [\h__\h] i want all right i can
 

3023
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:42,550
put oh [\h__\h] i want all right i can
probably

3024
01:15:42,550 --> 01:15:42,560
probably
 

3025
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:44,550
probably
i can probably

3026
01:15:44,550 --> 01:15:44,560
i can probably
 

3027
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:46,630
i can probably
reach that to make a portal yeah yeah

3028
01:15:46,630 --> 01:15:46,640
reach that to make a portal yeah yeah
 

3029
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:48,630
reach that to make a portal yeah yeah
yeah uh

3030
01:15:48,630 --> 01:15:48,640
yeah uh
 

3031
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:53,510
yeah uh
orange

3032
01:15:53,510 --> 01:15:53,520

 

3033
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:56,070

okay okay okay

3034
01:15:56,070 --> 01:15:56,080
okay okay okay
 

3035
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:57,750
okay okay okay
oh god is this gonna work

3036
01:15:57,750 --> 01:15:57,760
oh god is this gonna work
 

3037
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:00,950
oh god is this gonna work
we have blue on both of the platforms

3038
01:16:00,950 --> 01:16:00,960
we have blue on both of the platforms
 

3039
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:04,140
we have blue on both of the platforms
it should work

3040
01:16:04,140 --> 01:16:04,150
it should work
 

3041
01:16:04,150 --> 01:16:17,510
it should work
[Music]

3042
01:16:17,510 --> 01:16:17,520

 

3043
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:28,950

so that's a complete reassembly

3044
01:16:28,950 --> 01:16:28,960

 

3045
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:31,189

if that actually works

3046
01:16:31,189 --> 01:16:31,199
if that actually works
 

3047
01:16:31,199 --> 01:16:32,830
if that actually works
then that does

3048
01:16:32,830 --> 01:16:32,840
then that does
 

3049
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:36,149
then that does
sound like one way to get rid of a tumor

3050
01:16:36,149 --> 01:16:36,159
sound like one way to get rid of a tumor
 

3051
01:16:36,159 --> 01:16:37,030
sound like one way to get rid of a tumor
so

3052
01:16:37,030 --> 01:16:37,040
so
 

3053
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:38,870
so
i mean

3054
01:16:38,870 --> 01:16:38,880
i mean
 

3055
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:41,110
i mean
i don't know if you still

3056
01:16:41,110 --> 01:16:41,120
i don't know if you still
 

3057
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:41,910
i don't know if you still
i

3058
01:16:41,910 --> 01:16:41,920
i
 

3059
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:44,149
i
i suppose back then

3060
01:16:44,149 --> 01:16:44,159
i suppose back then
 

3061
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:46,229
i suppose back then
um what year was that

3062
01:16:46,229 --> 01:16:46,239
um what year was that
 

3063
01:16:46,239 --> 01:16:48,470
um what year was that
whatever year they probably didn't have

3064
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:48,480
whatever year they probably didn't have
 

3065
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:51,030
whatever year they probably didn't have
much uh any other ways to get rid of a

3066
01:16:51,030 --> 01:16:51,040
much uh any other ways to get rid of a
 

3067
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:53,350
much uh any other ways to get rid of a
tumor maybe i don't know how far they

3068
01:16:53,350 --> 01:16:53,360
tumor maybe i don't know how far they
 

3069
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:54,870
tumor maybe i don't know how far they
were back then

3070
01:16:54,870 --> 01:16:54,880
were back then
 

3071
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:55,910
were back then
but

3072
01:16:55,910 --> 01:16:55,920
but
 

3073
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:58,630
but
so that means that

3074
01:16:58,630 --> 01:16:58,640
so that means that
 

3075
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:01,830
so that means that
um you have two options you have uh the

3076
01:17:01,830 --> 01:17:01,840
um you have two options you have uh the
 

3077
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:05,110
um you have two options you have uh the
chance of dying because of the tumor

3078
01:17:05,110 --> 01:17:05,120
chance of dying because of the tumor
 

3079
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:07,590
chance of dying because of the tumor
um or the other option is you have a

3080
01:17:07,590 --> 01:17:07,600
um or the other option is you have a
 

3081
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:11,270
um or the other option is you have a
chance of maybe dying because of you

3082
01:17:11,270 --> 01:17:11,280
chance of maybe dying because of you
 

3083
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:13,350
chance of maybe dying because of you
know having your body being taken apart

3084
01:17:13,350 --> 01:17:13,360
know having your body being taken apart
 

3085
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:14,709
know having your body being taken apart
but there's also a chance that you'll

3086
01:17:14,709 --> 01:17:14,719
but there's also a chance that you'll
 

3087
01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:18,070
but there's also a chance that you'll
survive and be tumor free after that

3088
01:17:18,070 --> 01:17:18,080
survive and be tumor free after that
 

3089
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:19,350
survive and be tumor free after that
so

3090
01:17:19,350 --> 01:17:19,360
so
 

3091
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:21,430
so
there's higher chances of being tumor

3092
01:17:21,430 --> 01:17:21,440
there's higher chances of being tumor
 

3093
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:25,430
there's higher chances of being tumor
free and alive

3094
01:17:25,430 --> 01:17:25,440

 

3095
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:30,470

if you go with aperture sciences

3096
01:17:30,470 --> 01:17:30,480
if you go with aperture sciences
 

3097
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,229
if you go with aperture sciences
aperture laboratory laboratories

3098
01:17:32,229 --> 01:17:32,239
aperture laboratory laboratories
 

3099
01:17:32,239 --> 01:17:35,030
aperture laboratory laboratories
whatever yeah

3100
01:17:35,030 --> 01:17:35,040
whatever yeah
 

3101
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:37,189
whatever yeah
it could go wrong but

3102
01:17:37,189 --> 01:17:37,199
it could go wrong but
 

3103
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:39,189
it could go wrong but
it's more likely

3104
01:17:39,189 --> 01:17:39,199
it's more likely
 

3105
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:41,030
it's more likely
to go wrong

3106
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:41,040
to go wrong
 

3107
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:43,669
to go wrong
if you just don't do it so you should do

3108
01:17:43,669 --> 01:17:43,679
if you just don't do it so you should do
 

3109
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:46,630
if you just don't do it so you should do
it

3110
01:17:46,630 --> 01:17:46,640

 

3111
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:47,990

i mean

3112
01:17:47,990 --> 01:17:48,000
i mean
 

3113
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,470
i mean
i mean you're just gonna believe

3114
01:17:50,470 --> 01:17:50,480
i mean you're just gonna believe
 

3115
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:54,550
i mean you're just gonna believe
plus 120 yeah and now 60. only only 120

3116
01:17:54,550 --> 01:17:54,560
plus 120 yeah and now 60. only only 120
 

3117
01:17:54,560 --> 01:18:02,790
plus 120 yeah and now 60. only only 120
of you get someone else to join the test

3118
01:18:02,790 --> 01:18:02,800

 

3119
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:04,790

well

3120
01:18:04,790 --> 01:18:04,800
well
 

3121
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:06,390
well
i don't know if anyone really took them

3122
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:06,400
i don't know if anyone really took them
 

3123
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,229
i don't know if anyone really took them
up for that but

3124
01:18:08,229 --> 01:18:08,239
up for that but
 

3125
01:18:08,239 --> 01:18:10,229
up for that but

that's that doesn't make sense
 

3281
01:21:58,639 --> 01:22:00,870
that's that doesn't make sense
or maybe it does make sense

or maybe it does make sense
 

3283
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:02,629
or maybe it does make sense
so that for example if you put it to

3284
01:22:02,629 --> 01:22:02,639
so that for example if you put it to
 

3285
01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:04,550
so that for example if you put it to
like a wall

3286

that's not one of them
but okay well all of these ones are

4774
02:04:07,669 --> 02:04:07,679
but okay well all of these ones are
 

4775
02:04:07,679 --> 02:04:10,390
but okay well all of these ones are
portable so maybe i need to fall from

4776
02:04:10,390 --> 02:04:10,400
portable so maybe i need to fall from
 

4777
02:04:10,400 --> 02:04:12,550
portable so maybe i need to fall from
one of them and try my best to fall into

4778
02:04:12,550 --> 02:04:12,560
one of them and try my best to fall into
 

4779
02:04:12,560 --> 02:04:14,550
one of them and try my best to fall into
a hole down there

4780
02:04:14,550 --> 02:04:14,560
a hole down there
 

4781
02:04:14,560 --> 02:04:16,870
a hole down there
then beyond and then

then beyond and then
 

4783
02:04:16,880 --> 02:04:18,790
then beyond and then
make a portal there and beyond i don't

4784
02:04:18,790 --> 02:04:18,800
make a portal there and beyond i don't
 

4785
02:04:18,800 --> 02:04:20,310
make a portal there and beyond i don't
know that's

move while i'm falling
 

4801
02:04:36,560 --> 02:04:39,910

5880
02:33:27,590 --> 02:33:27,600
as much about test building as he does
 

5881

um

5888
02:33:37,190 --> 02:33:37,200
um
 

5889
02:33:37,200 --> 02:33:40,150
um
now you heard you he's not smart enough

5890
02:33:40,150 --> 02:33:40,160
now you heard you he's not smart enough
 

5891
02:33:40,160 --> 02:33:44,389
now you heard you he's not smart enough

5893
02:33:44,399 --> 02:33:48,150

that is hey come on wait lee was

5894
02:33:48,150 --> 02:33:48,160
that is hey come on wait lee was
 

5895
02:33:48,160 --> 02:33:50,230
that is hey come on wait lee was
somewhat smart smarter than the potato

5896
02:33:50,230 --> 02:33:50,240
somewhat smart smarter than the potato
 

5897
02:33:50,240 --> 02:33:51,830
somewhat smart smarter than the potato
at least

5898
02:33:51,830 --> 02:33:51,840
at least
 

5899
02:33:51,840 --> 02:33:53,590

okay someone in the chat said momentum
 

6955
03:01:56,640 --> 03:01:59,670
okay someone in the chat said momentum
and that made me think i need to fall

6956
03:01:59,670 --> 03:01:59,680
and that made me think i need to fall
 

6957
03:01:59,680 --> 03:02:02,389
and that made me think i need to fall
but where can i fall

6958
03:02:02,389 --> 03:02:02,399
but where can i fall
 

6959
03:02:02,399 --> 03:02:05,269
but where can i fall
if i can't make a portal above me then i

6960
03:02:05,269 --> 03:02:05,279
if i can't make a portal above me then i
 

6961
03:02:05,279 --> 03:02:08,870
if i can't make a portal above me then i
might want to make it you know anyway

6962
03:02:08,870 --> 03:02:08,880
might want to make it you know anyway
 

6963
03:02:08,880 --> 03:02:10,070
might want to make it you know anyway
okay

6964
03:02:10,070 --> 03:02:10,080
okay
 

6965
03:02:10,080 --> 03:02:16,550
okay
finally

6966
03:02:16,550 --> 03:02:16,560

 

6967
03:02:16,560 --> 03:02:17,910

oh there it is

6968
03:02:17,910 --> 03:02:17,920
oh there it is
 

6969
03:02:17,920 --> 03:02:21,030
oh there it is
oh

6970
03:02:21,030 --> 03:02:21,040

 

6971
03:02:21,040 --> 03:02:23,670

oh okay okay we need to catch it um we

6972
03:02:23,670 --> 03:02:23,680
oh okay okay we need to catch it um we
 

6973
03:02:23,680 --> 03:02:26,469
oh okay okay we need to catch it um we
can bring it here kind of the same way

6974
03:02:26,469 --> 03:02:26,479
can bring it here kind of the same way
 

6975
03:02:26,479 --> 03:02:30,710
can bring it here kind of the same way
right um

6976
03:02:30,710 --> 03:02:30,720

 

6977
03:02:30,720 --> 03:02:35,750

uh we will do that

6978
03:02:35,750 --> 03:02:35,760

 

6979
03:02:35,760 --> 03:02:38,950

catch it

6980
03:02:38,950 --> 03:02:38,960

 

6981
03:02:38,960 --> 03:02:41,190

nice catch

6982
03:02:41,190 --> 03:02:41,200
nice catch
 

6983
03:02:41,200 --> 03:02:43,750
nice catch
now we're gonna do the same thing which

6984
03:02:43,750 --> 03:02:43,760
now we're gonna do the same thing which
 

6985
03:02:43,760 --> 03:02:45,590
now we're gonna do the same thing which
will be even easier if i'm not the one

6986
03:02:45,590 --> 03:02:45,600
will be even easier if i'm not the one
 

6987
03:02:45,600 --> 03:02:49,910
will be even easier if i'm not the one
who's falling

6988
03:02:49,910 --> 03:02:49,920

 

6989
03:02:49,920 --> 03:02:52,309

there we go oh yeah oh i almost fell

6990
03:02:52,309 --> 03:02:52,319
there we go oh yeah oh i almost fell
 

6991
03:02:52,319 --> 03:02:53,349
there we go oh yeah oh i almost fell
down

6992
03:02:53,349 --> 03:02:53,359
down
 

6993
03:02:53,359 --> 03:02:55,349
down
what was that there was nothing that was

6994
03:02:55,349 --> 03:02:55,359
what was that there was nothing that was
 

6995
03:02:55,359 --> 03:02:58,790
what was that there was nothing that was
nothing there we go chill chill i did it

6996
03:02:58,790 --> 03:02:58,800
nothing there we go chill chill i did it
 

6997
03:02:58,800 --> 03:03:06,150
nothing there we go chill chill i did it
lately

6998
03:03:06,150 --> 03:03:06,160

 

6999
03:03:06,160 --> 03:03:08,070

eventually you build up a resistance to

7000
03:03:08,070 --> 03:03:08,080
eventually you build up a resistance to
 

7001
03:03:08,080 --> 03:03:10,870
eventually you build up a resistance to
it

7002
03:03:10,870 --> 03:03:10,880

 

7003
03:03:10,880 --> 03:03:12,469

unless you have the mental capacity to

7004
03:03:12,469 --> 03:03:12,479
unless you have the mental capacity to
 

7005
03:03:12,479 --> 03:03:13,830
unless you have the mental capacity to
push past it

7006
03:03:13,830 --> 03:03:13,840
push past it
 

7007
03:03:13,840 --> 03:03:15,830
push past it
it didn't matter to me oh yeah you

7008
03:03:15,830 --> 03:03:15,840
it didn't matter to me oh yeah you
 

7009
03:03:15,840 --> 03:03:18,550
it didn't matter to me oh yeah you
weren't that quite quite that euphoric

7010
03:03:18,550 --> 03:03:18,560
weren't that quite quite that euphoric
 

7011
03:03:18,560 --> 03:03:21,670
weren't that quite quite that euphoric
when i finished my tests that is true

7012
03:03:21,670 --> 03:03:21,680
when i finished my tests that is true
 

7013
03:03:21,680 --> 03:03:24,070
when i finished my tests that is true
so you already built up a resistance to

7014
03:03:24,070 --> 03:03:24,080
so you already built up a resistance to
 

7015
03:03:24,080 --> 03:03:32,870
so you already built up a resistance to
it why why not be happy

7016
03:03:32,870 --> 03:03:32,880

 

7017
03:03:32,880 --> 03:03:34,070

yeah

7018
03:03:34,070 --> 03:03:34,080

idea is going to be this

7472
03:14:33,750 --> 03:14:33,760

 

7473
03:14:33,760 --> 03:14:36,469

let's test it

7474
03:14:36,469 --> 03:14:36,479
let's test it
 

7475
03:14:36,479 --> 03:14:40,990
let's test it
um

7476
03:14:40,990 --> 03:14:41,000

7481
03:14:52,000 --> 03:14:59,990

doesn't quite do the trick

7482
03:14:59,990 --> 03:15:00,000

 

7483
03:15:00,000 --> 03:15:03,030

7484
03:15:03,030 --> 03:15:03,040

 

7485
03:15:03,040 --> 03:15:06,469

should i even start with that

03:15:06,469 --> 03:15:06,479
should i even start with that
 

7487
03:15:06,479 --> 03:15:15,429
should i even start with that

through there

7758
03:23:41,750 --> 03:23:41,760
through there
 

7759
03:23:41,760 --> 03:23:45,429
through there
to activate the other thing

7760
03:23:45,429 --> 03:23:45,439
to activate the other thing
 

7761
03:23:45,439 --> 03:23:48,070
to activate the other thing
oopsie wrong thing there we go

7762
03:23:48,070 --> 03:23:48,080
oopsie wrong thing there we go
 

7763
03:23:48,080 --> 03:23:50,150
oopsie wrong thing there we go
and there we go i think now we have

7764

and there we go i think now we have
 

7765
03:23:50,160 --> 03:23:52,550
and there we go i think now we have
solved the puzzle we just need this cube

7766
03:23:52,550 --> 03:23:52,560
solved the puzzle we just need this cube
 

7767
03:23:52,560 --> 03:23:55,030
solved the puzzle we just need this cube
to go back with us

7768
03:23:55,030 --> 03:23:55,040
to go back with us
 

7769
03:23:55,040 --> 03:23:57,269
to go back with us
uh

uh
 

7771
03:23:57,279 --> 03:24:01,269
uh
but for that we will momentarily have to

7772
03:24:01,269 --> 03:24:01,279
but for that we will momentarily have to
 

7773
03:24:01,279 --> 03:24:04,070
but for that we will momentarily have to
get rid of the portal

7774
03:24:04,070 --> 03:24:04,080
get rid of the portal
 

7775
03:24:04,080 --> 03:24:05,510
get rid of the portal

03:24:47,040 --> 03:24:50,790
i know i'm not sure if i can

7814
03:24:50,790 --> 03:24:50,800
stand on it but my idea would be
 

7815
03:24:50,800 --> 03:24:54,870
stand on it but my idea would be
placing a portal under this cube

7816

placing a portal under this cube
 

7817
03:24:54,880 --> 03:24:58,150
placing a portal under this cube
throwing it out of there i guess

7818

throwing it out of there i guess
 

7819
03:24:58,160 --> 03:25:01,190
throwing it out of there i guess
then this will go up again though

7820
03:25:01,190 --> 03:25:01,200

at 12 guys we're 12.
we are looking at

03:29:26,150 --> 03:29:26,160
we are looking at
 

7923
03:29:26,160 --> 03:29:27,830
we are looking at

couple of rooms here

couple of rooms here
 

7927
03:29:29,840 --> 03:29:32,550
couple of rooms here
uh all right let's see if we need the

7928
03:29:32,550 --> 03:29:32,560
uh all right let's see if we need the
 

7929
03:29:32,560 --> 03:29:36,870
uh all right let's see if we need the
lasers to go through all these

7930
03:29:36,870 --> 03:29:36,880
lasers to go through all these
 

7931
03:29:36,880 --> 03:29:40,550
lasers to go through all these
all these

7932
03:29:40,550 --> 03:29:40,560

 

7933
03:29:40,560 --> 03:29:44,070

it's not holes not sure what it is

7934
03:29:44,070 --> 03:29:44,080
it's not holes not sure what it is
 

7935
03:29:44,080 --> 03:29:45,910
it's not holes not sure what it is
so first of all we'll start with a

7936
03:29:45,910 --> 03:29:45,920
so first of all we'll start with a
 

7937
03:29:45,920 --> 03:29:47,670
so first of all we'll start with a
portal here

7938
03:29:47,670 --> 03:29:47,680
portal here
 

7939
03:29:47,680 --> 03:29:51,670
portal here
and then we'll put a portal here

7940
03:29:51,670 --> 03:29:51,680
and then we'll put a portal here
 

7941
03:29:51,680 --> 03:29:54,469
and then we'll put a portal here
and then all the platforms will start to

7942
03:29:54,469 --> 03:29:54,479
and then all the platforms will start to
 

7943
03:29:54,479 --> 03:29:58,229
and then all the platforms will start to
move

7944
03:29:58,229 --> 03:29:58,239

 

7945
03:29:58,239 --> 03:30:00,229

and they go all the way to that side

7946
03:30:00,229 --> 03:30:00,239
and they go all the way to that side
 

7947
03:30:00,239 --> 03:30:03,990
and they go all the way to that side
don't know who the i place one

03:30:14,070 --> 03:30:14,080
the low one makes a move
 

7957
03:30:14,080 --> 03:30:17,670

03:30:31,030 --> 03:30:31,040

 

7967
03:30:31,040 --> 03:30:33,190

you mean look at where the lines lead
 

7971
03:30:37,200 --> 03:30:39,349

have some ideas but i just need to think
 

8353
03:41:08,239 --> 03:41:14,389
have some ideas but i just need to think
a bit harder about them

8354
03:41:14,389 --> 03:41:14,399

 

8355
03:41:14,399 --> 03:41:15,670

momentum

8356
03:41:15,670 --> 03:41:15,680
momentum
 

8357
03:41:15,680 --> 03:41:17,670
momentum
what am i doing that porto what was i

8358
03:41:17,670 --> 03:41:17,680
what am i doing that porto what was i
 

8359
03:41:17,680 --> 03:41:20,710
what am i doing that porto what was i
doing that for us

8360
03:41:20,710 --> 03:41:20,720

 

8361
03:41:20,720 --> 03:41:26,070

what is that over there

8362
03:41:26,070 --> 03:41:26,080

 

8363
03:41:26,080 --> 03:41:34,950

what does that do

8364
03:41:34,950 --> 03:41:34,960

 

8365
03:41:34,960 --> 03:41:40,469

orange color

8366
03:41:40,469 --> 03:41:40,479

 

8367
03:41:40,479 --> 03:41:42,469

but i can't

8368
03:41:42,469 --> 03:41:42,479
but i can't
 

8369
03:41:42,479 --> 03:41:45,590
but i can't
i needed to ah with maybe with the

8370
03:41:45,590 --> 03:41:45,600
i needed to ah with maybe with the
 

8371
03:41:45,600 --> 03:41:46,950
i needed to ah with maybe with the
airflow

8372
03:41:46,950 --> 03:41:46,960
airflow
 

8373
03:41:46,960 --> 03:41:48,309
airflow
we can

8374
03:41:48,309 --> 03:41:48,319
we can
 

8375
03:41:48,319 --> 03:41:50,150
we can
eventually

8376
03:41:50,150 --> 03:41:50,160
eventually
 

8377
03:41:50,160 --> 03:41:53,030
eventually
get it to go straight over there

8378
03:41:53,030 --> 03:41:53,040
get it to go straight over there
 

8379
03:41:53,040 --> 03:41:55,750
get it to go straight over there
not a hotel

8380
03:41:55,750 --> 03:41:55,760
not a hotel
 

8381
03:41:55,760 --> 03:41:57,750
not a hotel
but for now

8382
03:41:57,750 --> 03:41:57,760
but for now
 

8383
03:41:57,760 --> 03:42:01,510
but for now
i think it's of no use

8384
03:42:01,510 --> 03:42:01,520
i think it's of no use
 

8385
03:42:01,520 --> 03:42:07,510
i think it's of no use
um

8386
03:42:07,510 --> 03:42:07,520

 

8387
03:42:07,520 --> 03:42:09,510

i still think

8388
03:42:09,510 --> 03:42:09,520
i still think
 

8389
03:42:09,520 --> 03:42:12,309
i still think
that i need

8390
03:42:12,309 --> 03:42:12,319

 

8391
03:42:12,319 --> 03:42:14,309

some kind of

8392
03:42:14,309 --> 03:42:14,319
some kind of
 

8393
03:42:14,319 --> 03:42:16,389
some kind of
momentum

8394
03:42:16,389 --> 03:42:16,399
momentum
 

8395
03:42:16,399 --> 03:42:18,429
momentum
but i lost track

8396
03:42:18,429 --> 03:42:18,439
but i lost track
 

8397
03:42:18,439 --> 03:42:22,309
but i lost track
of my thoughts so

8398
03:42:22,309 --> 03:42:22,319
of my thoughts so
 

8399
03:42:22,319 --> 03:42:25,269
of my thoughts so
yeah i know i need that cube so i can

8400
03:42:25,269 --> 03:42:25,279
yeah i know i need that cube so i can
 

8401
03:42:25,279 --> 03:42:37,030
yeah i know i need that cube so i can
have the airflow go through constantly

8402
03:42:37,030 --> 03:42:37,040

 

8403
03:42:37,040 --> 03:42:38,790

if i just

8404
03:42:38,790 --> 03:42:38,800
if i just
 

8405
03:42:38,800 --> 03:42:40,950
if i just
if i lay here

8406
03:42:40,950 --> 03:42:40,960
if i lay here
 

8407
03:42:40,960 --> 03:42:43,030
if i lay here
if i just lay here would you play the

8408
03:42:43,030 --> 03:42:43,040
if i just lay here would you play the
 

8409
03:42:43,040 --> 03:42:46,309
if i just lay here would you play the
game with me and backseat me all the

8410
03:42:46,309 --> 03:42:46,319
game with me and backseat me all the
 

8411
03:42:46,319 --> 03:42:48,070
game with me and backseat me all the
time

8412
03:42:48,070 --> 03:42:48,080
time
 

8413
03:42:48,080 --> 03:42:48,950
time

8419
03:42:54,399 --> 03:42:57,590

i want to fall out of there

8420
03:42:57,590 --> 03:42:57,600
i want to fall out of there
 

8421
03:42:57,600 --> 03:42:59,510

8437
03:43:54,800 --> 03:43:56,790

i don't know and i just need to test out

8438
03:43:56,790 --> 03:43:56,800
i don't know and i just need to test out
 

8439
03:43:56,800 --> 03:43:59,269
i don't know and i just need to test out
things

03:43:59,269 --> 03:43:59,279
things
 

8441
03:43:59,279 --> 03:44:04,150
things
yeah i want to use the airflow but

8443
03:44:04,160 --> 03:44:06,550

but i need to stand on it in order to

8444
03:44:06,550 --> 03:44:06,560
but i need to stand on it in order to
 

8445
03:44:06,560 --> 03:44:09,189
but i need to stand on it in order to
keep it

8446
03:44:09,189 --> 03:44:09,199

 

8447
03:44:09,199 --> 03:44:13,429

here first right not over there
 

8469
03:44:42,720 --> 03:44:43,990
here first right not over there
can we get another cube this one

8470
03:44:43,990 --> 03:44:44,000
can we get another cube this one
 

8471
03:44:44,000 --> 03:44:45,670
can we get another cube this one
disappears right if we create another

8472
03:44:45,670 --> 03:44:45,680
disappears right if we create another
 

8473
03:44:45,680 --> 03:44:46,790
disappears right if we create another
one

8474
03:44:46,790 --> 03:44:46,800

okay
that means there must be another cube

8504
03:45:28,550 --> 03:45:28,560
that means there must be another cube
 

8505
03:45:28,560 --> 03:45:30,150
that means there must be another cube
somewhere

8506
03:45:30,150 --> 03:45:30,160
somewhere
 

8507
03:45:30,160 --> 03:45:33,269

this [\h__\h] so

8530
03:46:04,630 --> 03:46:04,640
this [\h__\h] so
 

8531
03:46:04,640 --> 03:46:07,750
this [\h__\h] so
uh the air would be

8532
03:46:07,750 --> 03:46:07,760
uh the air would be
 

8533
03:46:07,760 --> 03:46:10,150
uh the air would be
ideally going through there

8534
03:46:10,150 --> 03:46:10,160
ideally going through there
 

8535
03:46:10,160 --> 03:46:12,870
ideally going through there
right

8536
03:46:12,870 --> 03:46:12,880

 

8537
03:46:12,880 --> 03:46:15,670

um

8538
03:46:15,670 --> 03:46:15,680

 

8539
03:46:15,680 --> 03:46:22,790

um

8540
03:46:22,790 --> 03:46:22,800

 

8541
03:46:22,800 --> 03:46:24,900

now i need to go in here

8542
03:46:24,900 --> 03:46:24,910
now i need to go in here
 

8543
03:46:24,910 --> 03:46:26,710
now i need to go in here

and activate it

8546
03:46:28,950 --> 03:46:28,960
and activate it
 

8547
03:46:28,960 --> 03:46:30,229
and activate it
but

8548
03:46:30,229 --> 03:46:30,239
but
 

8549
03:46:30,239 --> 03:46:31,750
but
i can't get rid of that because when i'm

8550
03:46:31,750 --> 03:46:31,760
i can't get rid of that because when i'm
 

8551
03:46:31,760 --> 03:46:34,229
i can't get rid of that because when i'm
in here

8552
03:46:34,229 --> 03:46:34,239
in here
 

8553
03:46:34,239 --> 03:46:36,229
in here
i can't make that portal i could

8554
03:46:36,229 --> 03:46:36,239
i can't make that portal i could
 

8555
03:46:36,239 --> 03:46:38,070
i can't make that portal i could
probably make this one

8556
03:46:38,070 --> 03:46:38,080
probably make this one
 

8557
03:46:38,080 --> 03:46:42,469
probably make this one
maybe

8558
03:46:42,469 --> 03:46:42,479

 

8559
03:46:42,479 --> 03:46:44,309

or does the cube go in this room and i

8560
03:46:44,309 --> 03:46:44,319
or does the cube go in this room and i
 

8561
03:46:44,319 --> 03:46:50,870
or does the cube go in this room and i
go over there

8562
03:46:50,870 --> 03:46:50,880

 

8563
03:46:50,880 --> 03:47:03,429

stand

8564
03:47:03,429 --> 03:47:03,439

 

8565
03:47:03,439 --> 03:47:06,469

okay still try it the other way around

8566
03:47:06,469 --> 03:47:06,479
okay still try it the other way around
 

8567
03:47:06,479 --> 03:47:09,590
okay still try it the other way around
yeah that that might work easier

8568
03:47:09,590 --> 03:47:09,600
yeah that that might work easier
 

8569
03:47:09,600 --> 03:47:14,229
yeah that that might work easier
that might make more sense cause yeah

8570
03:47:14,229 --> 03:47:14,239
that might make more sense cause yeah
 

8571
03:47:14,239 --> 03:47:17,670
that might make more sense cause yeah
okay

8572
03:47:17,670 --> 03:47:17,680

 

8573
03:47:17,680 --> 03:47:20,309

yeah yeah yeah yeah and we just can we

yeah yeah yeah yeah and we just can we
 

8575
03:47:20,319 --> 03:47:24,150
yeah yeah yeah yeah and we just can we
can drop it and then we can make it

8576
03:47:24,150 --> 03:47:24,160
can drop it and then we can make it
 

8577
03:47:24,160 --> 03:47:25,750
can drop it and then we can make it
go all the way

8578
03:47:25,750 --> 03:47:25,760
go all the way
 

8579
03:47:25,760 --> 03:47:30,070
go all the way
over here and then we

8580
03:47:30,070 --> 03:47:30,080

 

8581
03:47:30,080 --> 03:47:33,750

know we drop it here

8582
03:47:33,750 --> 03:47:33,760
know we drop it here
 

8583
03:47:33,760 --> 03:47:36,469

what did i miss though
 

8625
03:48:43,359 --> 03:48:46,389
what did i miss though
momentum perhaps um

8626
03:48:46,389 --> 03:48:46,399
momentum perhaps um
 

8627
03:48:46,399 --> 03:48:49,189
momentum perhaps um
need more of it no i don't know ah

8628
03:48:49,189 --> 03:48:49,199
need more of it no i don't know ah
 

8629
03:48:49,199 --> 03:48:51,750
need more of it no i don't know ah
airflow we would oh [\h__\h] uh

8630
03:48:51,750 --> 03:48:51,760
airflow we would oh [\h__\h] uh
 

8631
03:48:51,760 --> 03:48:54,469
airflow we would oh [\h__\h] uh
we would want more

8632
03:48:54,469 --> 03:48:54,479
we would want more
 

8633
03:48:54,479 --> 03:48:57,030
we would want more
we we want the air flow

8634
03:48:57,030 --> 03:48:57,040
we we want the air flow
 

8635
03:48:57,040 --> 03:48:59,750
we we want the air flow
ah we would take the cube back

8636
03:48:59,750 --> 03:48:59,760
ah we would take the cube back
 

8637
03:48:59,760 --> 03:49:02,950
ah we would take the cube back
because we don't need the color anymore

8638
03:49:02,950 --> 03:49:02,960
because we don't need the color anymore
 

8639
03:49:02,960 --> 03:49:05,429
because we don't need the color anymore
leave it here so so that the airflow

8640
03:49:05,429 --> 03:49:05,439
leave it here so so that the airflow
 

8641
03:49:05,439 --> 03:49:08,830
leave it here so so that the airflow
continues

8642
03:49:08,830 --> 03:49:08,840

 

8643
03:49:08,840 --> 03:49:12,550

right yes yes yes yes i think so

8644
03:49:12,550 --> 03:49:12,560
right yes yes yes yes i think so
 

8645
03:49:12,560 --> 03:49:15,269
right yes yes yes yes i think so
yes yes

8646
03:49:15,269 --> 03:49:15,279

 

8647
03:49:15,279 --> 03:49:16,070

so

8648
03:49:16,070 --> 03:49:16,080
so
 

8649
03:49:16,080 --> 03:49:16,870

uh
 

8651
03:49:16,880 --> 03:49:26,790
uh
and then um we will maybe put it through

8652
03:49:26,790 --> 03:49:26,800

 

8653
03:49:26,800 --> 03:49:29,189

i'm wondering

8656
03:49:31,189 --> 03:49:31,199
i'm wondering
 

8657
03:49:31,199 --> 03:49:32,389
i'm wondering
i think

8658
03:49:32,389 --> 03:49:32,399
i think
 

8659
03:49:32,399 --> 03:49:34,229
i think
it could

8660
03:49:34,229 --> 03:49:34,239
it could
 

8661
03:49:34,239 --> 03:49:37,429
it could
go here

8662
03:49:37,429 --> 03:49:37,439

 

8663
03:49:37,439 --> 03:49:39,750

test with if you kill me
you have one problem with logic there

8696
03:50:18,790 --> 03:50:18,800
you have one problem with logic there
 

8697
03:50:18,800 --> 03:50:20,710
you have one problem with logic there
you're never gonna find happiness if you

8698

04:53:45,750 --> 04:53:45,760
i was very bad at many riddles but
 

10689

i was very bad at many riddles but
that has nothing to do with the game

10693
04:53:51,120 --> 04:53:52,310
being bad just me being bad
so

10694
04:53:52,310 --> 04:53:52,320
so
 

10695
04:53:52,320 --> 04:53:56,708
so
portal 2 only

10696
04:53:56,708 --> 04:53:56,718

 

10697
04:53:56,718 --> 04:53:59,910

what would i rate it i think

10698
04:53:59,910 --> 04:53:59,920
what would i rate it i think
 

10699
04:53:59,920 --> 04:54:02,470
what would i rate it i think
it's not the kind of game i usually play

10700
04:54:02,470 --> 04:54:02,480
it's not the kind of game i usually play
 

10701
04:54:02,480 --> 04:54:04,788
it's not the kind of game i usually play
but for what it is it's definitely a 10

10702
04:54:04,788 --> 04:54:04,798
but for what it is it's definitely a 10
 

10703
04:54:04,798 --> 04:54:07,510
but for what it is it's definitely a 10
out of 10.

10704
04:54:07,510 --> 04:54:07,520

 

10705
04:54:07,520 --> 04:54:10,070

for the for the genre that it is i think

10706
04:54:10,070 --> 04:54:10,080
for the for the genre that it is i think
 

10707
04:54:10,080 --> 04:54:14,230
for the for the genre that it is i think
it's it's pretty much a 10 out of 10.

10708
04:54:14,230 --> 04:54:14,240
it's it's pretty much a 10 out of 10.
 

10709
04:54:14,240 --> 04:54:20,230
it's it's pretty much a 10 out of 10.
i think i don't know what would um

10710
04:54:20,230 --> 04:54:20,240
i think i don't know what would um
 

10711
04:54:20,240 --> 04:54:22,470
i think i don't know what would um
what reason there would be

10712
04:54:22,470 --> 04:54:22,480
what reason there would be
 

10713
04:54:22,480 --> 04:54:25,030
what reason there would be
to give it any less points like i don't

10714
04:54:25,030 --> 04:54:25,040
to give it any less points like i don't
 

10715
04:54:25,040 --> 04:54:28,150
to give it any less points like i don't
i don't recall anything negative

10716
04:54:28,150 --> 04:54:28,160
i don't recall anything negative
 

10717
04:54:28,160 --> 04:54:29,910
i don't recall anything negative
it's just okay it was a bit difficult

10718
04:54:29,910 --> 04:54:29,920
it's just okay it was a bit difficult
 

10719
04:54:29,920 --> 04:54:31,670
it's just okay it was a bit difficult
but that doesn't make it any bad and it

10720
04:54:31,670 --> 04:54:31,680
but that doesn't make it any bad and it
 

10721
04:54:31,680 --> 04:54:35,190
but that doesn't make it any bad and it
was not like absolutely unsolvable

10722
04:54:35,190 --> 04:54:35,200
was not like absolutely unsolvable
 

10723
04:54:35,200 --> 04:54:36,948
was not like absolutely unsolvable
so

10724
04:54:36,948 --> 04:54:36,958
so
 

10725
04:54:36,958 --> 04:54:38,070
so
yeah

10726
04:54:38,070 --> 04:54:38,080

04:56:05,760 --> 04:56:07,990
um we're gonna
probably have to do two parts because i

10792
04:56:07,990 --> 04:56:08,000
probably have to do two parts because i
 

10793
04:56:08,000 --> 04:56:10,070
probably have to do two parts because i
don't think we can go longer than three

10794
04:56:10,070 --> 04:56:10,080
don't think we can go longer than three
 

10795
04:56:10,080 --> 04:56:12,788
don't think we can go longer than three
hours and i've heard it's like six hours

10796
04:56:12,788 --> 04:56:12,798
hours and i've heard it's like six hours
 

10797
04:56:12,798 --> 04:56:13,830
hours and i've heard it's like six hours
roughly

10798
04:56:13,830 --> 04:56:13,840
roughly
 

10799
04:56:13,840 --> 04:56:17,270
roughly
um so it will be a two-part um
