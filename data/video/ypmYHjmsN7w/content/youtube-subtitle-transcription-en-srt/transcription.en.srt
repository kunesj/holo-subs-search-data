8558
03:34:39,269 --> 03:34:39,279
to advertise it that way but I think
 

8559
03:34:39,279 --> 03:34:41,030
to advertise it that way but I think
it's nice to like separate it in

8560
03:34:41,030 --> 03:34:41,040
it's nice to like separate it in
 

8561
03:34:41,040 --> 03:34:42,950
it's nice to like separate it in

even if the never wasn't really that
 

8565
03:34:44,479 --> 03:34:46,590
even if the never wasn't really that
necessary I think it's

8566
03:34:46,590 --> 03:34:46,600
necessary I think it's
 

8567
03:34:46,600 --> 03:34:48,750
necessary I think it's
good to keep those things separated and

8568
03:34:48,750 --> 03:34:48,760
good to keep those things separated and
 

8569
03:34:48,760 --> 03:34:50,790
good to keep those things separated and

another Farm next to the trees for
 

9063
03:45:31,239 --> 03:45:33,750
another Farm next to the trees for
sugarcane oh that's a good idea how do

9064
03:45:33,750 --> 03:45:33,760
sugarcane oh that's a good idea how do
 

9065
03:45:33,760 --> 03:45:35,389
sugarcane oh that's a good idea how do
you plant it you just stick it in the

9066
03:45:35,389 --> 03:45:35,399
you plant it you just stick it in the
 

9067
03:45:35,399 --> 03:45:38,349
you plant it you just stick it in the
ground yeah dirt blocks and then it

9068
03:45:38,349 --> 03:45:38,359
ground yeah dirt blocks and then it
 

9069
03:45:38,359 --> 03:45:40,870
ground yeah dirt blocks and then it
doesn't even have to be like you know

9070
03:45:40,870 --> 03:45:40,880
doesn't even have to be like you know
 

9071
03:45:40,880 --> 03:45:44,070
doesn't even have to be like you know
properly made with a hoe as far as I can

9072
03:45:44,070 --> 03:45:44,080
properly made with a hoe as far as I can
 

9073
03:45:44,080 --> 03:45:46,750
properly made with a hoe as far as I can
tell but it has to have water around it

9074
03:45:46,750 --> 03:45:46,760
tell but it has to have water around it
 

9075
03:45:46,760 --> 03:45:50,149
tell but it has to have water around it
okay water around it next to water okay

9076
03:45:50,149 --> 03:45:50,159
okay water around it next to water okay
 

9077
03:45:50,159 --> 03:45:52,269
okay water around it next to water okay
it's probably like with the wheat right

9078
03:45:52,269 --> 03:45:52,279
it's probably like with the wheat right
 

9079
03:45:52,279 --> 03:45:54,910
it's probably like with the wheat right
that it needs um one block of water and

9080
03:45:54,910 --> 03:45:54,920
that it needs um one block of water and
 

9081
03:45:54,920 --> 03:45:57,550
that it needs um one block of water and
then you can place four fields of sugar

9082
03:45:57,550 --> 03:45:57,560
then you can place four fields of sugar
 

9083
03:45:57,560 --> 03:46:00,590
then you can place four fields of sugar
cane around it right in all directions

9084
03:46:00,590 --> 03:46:00,600
cane around it right in all directions
 

9085
03:46:00,600 --> 03:46:03,189
cane around it right in all directions
probably same with

9086
03:46:03,189 --> 03:46:03,199
probably same with
 

9087
03:46:03,199 --> 03:46:06,349
probably same with
wheat okay you just need in any case

9088
03:46:06,349 --> 03:46:06,359
wheat okay you just need in any case
 

9089
03:46:06,359 --> 03:46:07,790

9099
03:46:19,479 --> 03:46:21,830
i' like to once I can figure out how to
do it um just cuz you know my brain's

9100
03:46:21,830 --> 03:46:21,840
do it um just cuz you know my brain's
 

9101
03:46:21,840 --> 03:46:26,030
do it um just cuz you know my brain's
really small that's okay uh yeah maybe

9102

9111
03:46:35,840 --> 03:46:38,149

uh rows of water you could do rows of

9112
03:46:38,149 --> 03:46:38,159
uh rows of water you could do rows of
 

9113
03:46:38,159 --> 03:46:40,750
uh rows of water you could do rows of
water and then yeah the sugarcane always

9114
03:46:40,750 --> 03:46:40,760
water and then yeah the sugarcane always
 

9115
03:46:40,760 --> 03:46:43,030
water and then yeah the sugarcane always
has to touch the block of water like be

9116
03:46:43,030 --> 03:46:43,040
has to touch the block of water like be
 

9117
03:46:43,040 --> 03:46:45,670
has to touch the block of water like be
right next to it oh I see gotcha damn

9295
03:50:56,960 --> 03:51:00,309

helping this will be the main field and

9296
03:51:00,309 --> 03:51:00,319
helping this will be the main field and
 

9297
03:51:00,319 --> 03:51:02,070
helping this will be the main field and

which one um let's see we should turn

9364
03:52:37,830 --> 03:52:37,840
which one um let's see we should turn
 

9365
03:52:37,840 --> 03:52:40,030
which one um let's see we should turn
which one into so the the line all the

9366
03:52:40,030 --> 03:52:40,040
which one into so the the line all the
 

9367
03:52:40,040 --> 03:52:41,269
which one into so the the line all the
way here that I'm standing on we should

9368
03:52:41,269 --> 03:52:41,279
way here that I'm standing on we should
 

9369
03:52:41,279 --> 03:52:44,510
way here that I'm standing on we should
turn it into a trench oh wait wait it's

9370
03:52:44,510 --> 03:52:44,520
turn it into a trench oh wait wait it's
 

9371
03:52:44,520 --> 03:52:46,790
turn it into a trench oh wait wait it's
the furthest one on the edge turn it

9372
03:52:46,790 --> 03:52:46,800
the furthest one on the edge turn it
 

9373
03:52:46,800 --> 03:52:48,309
the furthest one on the edge turn it
into a trench that should become a

9374
03:52:48,309 --> 03:52:48,319
into a trench that should become a
 

9375
03:52:48,319 --> 03:52:50,750
into a trench that should become a
trench and then you make another line of

9376
03:52:50,750 --> 03:52:50,760
trench and then you make another line of
 

9377
03:52:50,760 --> 03:52:52,309
trench and then you make another line of
dirt blocks there okay yeah I'll just

9378
03:52:52,309 --> 03:52:52,319
dirt blocks there okay yeah I'll just
 

9379
03:52:52,319 --> 03:52:53,990
dirt blocks there okay yeah I'll just
need more dirt we just got to get more

need more dirt we just got to get more
 

9381
03:52:54,000 --> 03:52:56,269
need more dirt we just got to get more
dirt blocks and once we have more of

9382
03:52:56,269 --> 03:52:56,279
dirt blocks and once we have more of
 

9383
03:52:56,279 --> 03:52:58,630
dirt blocks and once we have more of
those then we can do

9384
03:52:58,630 --> 03:52:58,640
those then we can do
 

9385
03:52:58,640 --> 03:53:02,349
those then we can do
anything wait does it need not be oh is

9386
03:53:02,349 --> 03:53:02,359
anything wait does it need not be oh is
 

9387
