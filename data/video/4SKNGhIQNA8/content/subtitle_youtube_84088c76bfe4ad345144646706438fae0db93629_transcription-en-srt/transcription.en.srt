they probably just heard antidepressants

11768
05:20:57,110 --> 05:20:57,120

and then thought okay no no not as
 

11771
05:21:00,480 --> 05:21:03,288
and then thought okay no no not as
painkillers but apparently they're look

11772
05:21:03,288 --> 05:21:03,298
painkillers but apparently they're look
 

11773
05:21:03,298 --> 05:21:04,670
painkillers but apparently they're look
it up it is

11774
05:21:04,670 --> 05:21:04,680

11775
05:21:04,680 --> 05:21:08,570
it up it is
it is really yes like supposed to help

11776
05:21:08,570 --> 05:21:08,580
it is really yes like supposed to help
 

11777
05:21:08,580 --> 05:21:11,270
it is really yes like supposed to help
in some cases it didn't help me though

11778
05:21:11,270 --> 05:21:11,280
in some cases it didn't help me though
 

11779
05:21:11,280 --> 05:21:13,730
in some cases it didn't help me though
so I I wasn't even taking it for that

but yeah
yeah it was such a bad timing I only

11800
05:21:35,690 --> 05:21:35,700
yeah it was such a bad timing I only
 

11801
05:21:35,700 --> 05:21:37,610
yeah it was such a bad timing I only
said it because I was so honest if it

11802
05:21:37,610 --> 05:21:37,620
said it because I was so honest if it
 

11803
05:21:37,620 --> 05:21:40,490
said it because I was so honest if it
was like after I gave up on them then I

it was also because I was really scared
 

11809
05:21:43,920 --> 05:21:46,310

that uh because they did a blood test

11810
05:21:46,310 --> 05:21:46,320
that uh because they did a blood test
 

11811
05:21:46,320 --> 05:21:48,948
that uh because they did a blood test
that they would see it in my blood and

the ID games were a lot of fun but I

05:59:25,250 --> 05:59:25,260
the ID games were a lot of fun but I
 

13397
05:59:25,260 --> 05:59:26,750
the ID games were a lot of fun but I
wonder if for the Japanese one they're

13398
05:59:26,750 --> 05:59:26,760
wonder if for the Japanese one they're
 

13399
05:59:26,760 --> 05:59:28,610
wonder if for the Japanese one they're
gonna repeat the same games again

13400
05:59:28,610 --> 05:59:28,620
gonna repeat the same games again
 

13401
05:59:28,620 --> 05:59:31,610
gonna repeat the same games again
because I feel like generally they reuse

13402
05:59:31,610 --> 05:59:31,620
because I feel like generally they reuse
 

13403
05:59:31,620 --> 05:59:33,350
because I feel like generally they reuse
the games that they've had in previous

the games that they've had in previous
 

13405
05:59:33,360 --> 05:59:35,330
the games that they've had in previous
years and maybe add like one or two

13406
05:59:35,330 --> 05:59:35,340
years and maybe add like one or two
 

13407
05:59:35,340 --> 05:59:36,948
years and maybe add like one or two
different ones

13408
05:59:36,948 --> 05:59:36,958
different ones
 

13409
05:59:36,958 --> 05:59:39,230

13410
05:59:39,230 --> 05:59:39,240

13411
05:59:39,240 --> 05:59:41,868
but they've repeated the flying one I
think they repeated the

13412
05:59:41,868 --> 05:59:41,878

match because they all focused on me and

13720
06:07:07,070 --> 06:07:07,080
match because they all focused on me and
 

13721
06:07:07,080 --> 06:07:09,890
match because they all focused on me and
you know that made me feel a lot lot

13722
06:07:09,890 --> 06:07:09,900
you know that made me feel a lot lot
 

13723
06:07:09,900 --> 06:07:14,868
you know that made me feel a lot lot
better about the whole match

13724
06:07:14,868 --> 06:07:14,878
better about the whole match
 

13725
06:07:14,878 --> 06:07:16,970
better about the whole match
but honestly think about it I understand

13726
06:07:16,970 --> 06:07:16,980
but honestly think about it I understand
 

13727
06:07:16,980 --> 06:07:19,788
but honestly think about it I understand
that maybe when they were watching the

13728
06:07:19,788 --> 06:07:19,798
that maybe when they were watching the
 

13729
06:07:19,798 --> 06:07:21,770
that maybe when they were watching the
first match they saw how bad I was and

13730
06:07:21,770 --> 06:07:21,780
first match they saw how bad I was and
 

13731
06:07:21,780 --> 06:07:24,288
first match they saw how bad I was and
thought okay then we can take her down

13732
06:07:24,288 --> 06:07:24,298
thought okay then we can take her down
 

13733
06:07:24,298 --> 06:07:27,530
thought okay then we can take her down
easily but you're not really even doing

13734
06:07:27,530 --> 06:07:27,540
easily but you're not really even doing
 

13735
06:07:27,540 --> 06:07:30,048
easily but you're not really even doing
anything any significant damage right

13736
06:07:30,048 --> 06:07:30,058
anything any significant damage right
 

13737
06:07:30,058 --> 06:07:33,708
anything any significant damage right
when you gang up on me all the time

13738
06:07:33,708 --> 06:07:33,718
when you gang up on me all the time
 

13739
06:07:33,718 --> 06:07:36,948
when you gang up on me all the time
because I wasn't contributing much in

13740
06:07:36,948 --> 06:07:36,958
because I wasn't contributing much in
 

13741
06:07:36,958 --> 06:07:38,530
because I wasn't contributing much in
the first place

13742
06:07:38,530 --> 06:07:38,540
the first place
 

13743
06:07:38,540 --> 06:07:41,570
the first place
so maybe should gang up on the better

13744
06:07:41,570 --> 06:07:41,580
so maybe should gang up on the better
 

13745
06:07:41,580 --> 06:07:46,690
so maybe should gang up on the better
players like fauna or so yeah

06:08:02,930 --> 06:08:02,940
me apparently in like because we were
 

13761
06:08:02,940 --> 06:08:05,628
me apparently in like because we were
mostly up at the Top Lane they were able

13762
06:08:05,628 --> 06:08:05,638
mostly up at the Top Lane they were able
 

13763
06:08:05,638 --> 06:08:08,150
mostly up at the Top Lane they were able
to get objectives at the bottom and and

13764
06:08:08,150 --> 06:08:08,160
to get objectives at the bottom and and
 

13765
06:08:08,160 --> 06:08:11,030
to get objectives at the bottom and and
dunk at the bottom and all that so

13766
06:08:11,030 --> 06:08:11,040
dunk at the bottom and all that so
 

13767
06:08:11,040 --> 06:08:13,730
dunk at the bottom and all that so

13769
06:08:13,740 --> 06:08:16,128

to run around at the bottom in hindsight

13770
06:08:16,128 --> 06:08:16,138
to run around at the bottom in hindsight
 

13771
06:08:16,138 --> 06:08:17,810
to run around at the bottom in hindsight
maybe Kelly should have joined us at the

13772
06:08:17,810 --> 06:08:17,820
maybe Kelly should have joined us at the
 

13773
06:08:17,820 --> 06:08:19,910
maybe Kelly should have joined us at the
top a bit more often so that we would

13774
06:08:19,910 --> 06:08:19,920
top a bit more often so that we would
 

13775
06:08:19,920 --> 06:08:22,610
top a bit more often so that we would
have had a higher chance of survival but

13776
06:08:22,610 --> 06:08:22,620
have had a higher chance of survival but
 

13777
06:08:22,620 --> 06:08:25,070
have had a higher chance of survival but
if Cali was also lagging then I would

13778
06:08:25,070 --> 06:08:25,080
if Cali was also lagging then I would
 

13779
06:08:25,080 --> 06:08:28,310
if Cali was also lagging then I would
have two lagging players and me and who

13780
06:08:28,310 --> 06:08:28,320
have two lagging players and me and who
 

13781
06:08:28,320 --> 06:08:30,890
have two lagging players and me and who
knows how that would have went

13782
06:08:30,890 --> 06:08:30,900
knows how that would have went
 

13783
06:08:30,900 --> 06:08:32,868
knows how that would have went
but yeah Cali was really motivated and

13784
06:08:32,868 --> 06:08:32,878
but yeah Cali was really motivated and
 

13785
06:08:32,878 --> 06:08:34,430
but yeah Cali was really motivated and
she was really quick in our practices

13786
06:08:34,430 --> 06:08:34,440
she was really quick in our practices
 

13787
06:08:34,440 --> 06:08:37,850
she was really quick in our practices

13789
06:08:37,860 --> 06:08:39,948

whenever somebody was like Cali we need

13790
06:08:39,948 --> 06:08:39,958
whenever somebody was like Cali we need
 

13791
06:08:39,958 --> 06:08:41,810
whenever somebody was like Cali we need

06:08:41,820 --> 06:08:44,390

camping in the in the hedges
 

13967
06:12:14,400 --> 06:12:18,590
camping in the in the hedges
in the grass when Rayquaza showed up

13968
06:12:18,590 --> 06:12:18,600
in the grass when Rayquaza showed up
 

13969
06:12:18,600 --> 06:12:21,470
in the grass when Rayquaza showed up
because professional players

13970
06:12:21,470 --> 06:12:21,480
because professional players
 

13971
06:12:21,480 --> 06:12:25,070
because professional players
for them both teams usually hide in the

13972
06:12:25,070 --> 06:12:25,080
for them both teams usually hide in the
 

13973
06:12:25,080 --> 06:12:27,530
for them both teams usually hide in the
grass when Rayquaza shows up and some of

13974
06:12:27,530 --> 06:12:27,540
grass when Rayquaza shows up and some of
 

13975
06:12:27,540 --> 06:12:29,390
grass when Rayquaza shows up and some of
them some of every once in a while they

13976
06:12:29,390 --> 06:12:29,400
them some of every once in a while they
 

13977
06:12:29,400 --> 06:12:31,850
them some of every once in a while they
like poke out and they say you know they

13978
06:12:31,850 --> 06:12:31,860
like poke out and they say you know they
 

13979
06:12:31,860 --> 06:12:33,650
like poke out and they say you know they
look around and maybe tease them a

13980
06:12:33,650 --> 06:12:33,660
look around and maybe tease them a
 

13981
06:12:33,660 --> 06:12:35,628
look around and maybe tease them a
little bit but nobody really starts to

13982
06:12:35,628 --> 06:12:35,638
little bit but nobody really starts to
 

13983
06:12:35,638 --> 06:12:40,390
little bit but nobody really starts to
fight for quite a while yeah I did it oh

13984
06:12:40,390 --> 06:12:40,400
fight for quite a while yeah I did it oh
 

13985
06:12:40,400 --> 06:12:43,150
fight for quite a while yeah I did it oh
yeah they probably

13986
06:12:43,150 --> 06:12:43,160
yeah they probably
 

13987
06:12:43,160 --> 06:12:47,690
yeah they probably
knew some real strats yeah

13988
06:12:47,690 --> 06:12:47,700

 

13989
06:12:47,700 --> 06:12:49,970

and then you wait for some moment but

13990
06:12:49,970 --> 06:12:49,980
and then you wait for some moment but
 

13991
06:12:49,980 --> 06:12:52,670
and then you wait for some moment but
I'm not sure exactly what really is the

13992
06:12:52,670 --> 06:12:52,680
I'm not sure exactly what really is the
 

13993
06:12:52,680 --> 06:12:53,990
I'm not sure exactly what really is the
moment

13994
06:12:53,990 --> 06:12:54,000
moment
 

13995
06:12:54,000 --> 06:12:56,448
moment
maybe when somebody just can't take it

13996
06:12:56,448 --> 06:12:56,458
maybe when somebody just can't take it
 

13997
06:12:56,458 --> 06:12:58,010
maybe when somebody just can't take it
anymore when somebody loses their

13998
06:12:58,010 --> 06:12:58,020
anymore when somebody loses their
 

13999
06:12:58,020 --> 06:13:00,110
anymore when somebody loses their
patience somebody

14000
06:13:00,110 --> 06:13:00,120
patience somebody
 

14001
06:13:00,120 --> 06:13:02,570
patience somebody
takes a shot

14002
06:13:02,570 --> 06:13:02,580
takes a shot
 

14003
06:13:02,580 --> 06:13:04,548
takes a shot
attacks they start ganging up on each

14004
06:13:04,548 --> 06:13:04,558
attacks they start ganging up on each
 

14005
06:13:04,558 --> 06:13:06,350
attacks they start ganging up on each
other first before really attacking

14006
06:13:06,350 --> 06:13:06,360
other first before really attacking
 

14007
06:13:06,360 --> 06:13:07,730
other first before really attacking
Rayquaza

14008
06:13:07,730 --> 06:13:07,740
Rayquaza
 

14009
06:13:07,740 --> 06:13:10,610
Rayquaza
trying to get momentum

14010
06:13:10,610 --> 06:13:10,620
trying to get momentum
 

14011
06:13:10,620 --> 06:13:14,090
trying to get momentum
to completely eradicate one team and

14012
06:13:14,090 --> 06:13:14,100
to completely eradicate one team and
 

14013
06:13:14,100 --> 06:13:16,070
to completely eradicate one team and
then they try their best to with the

14014
06:13:16,070 --> 06:13:16,080
then they try their best to with the
 

14015
06:13:16,080 --> 06:13:20,448
then they try their best to with the
remaining members quickly kill Rayquaza

14016
06:13:20,448 --> 06:13:20,458
remaining members quickly kill Rayquaza
 

14017
06:13:20,458 --> 06:13:21,910
remaining members quickly kill Rayquaza
um

14018
06:13:21,910 --> 06:13:21,920
um
 

14019
06:13:21,920 --> 06:13:24,288
um
it's exciting

14020
06:13:24,288 --> 06:13:24,298
it's exciting
 

14021
06:13:24,298 --> 06:13:26,448
it's exciting
so exciting

14022
06:13:26,448 --> 06:13:26,458
so exciting
 

14023
06:13:26,458 --> 06:13:31,548
so exciting
but it's also so I feel like 90 90

14024
06:13:31,548 --> 06:13:31,558
but it's also so I feel like 90 90
 

14025
06:13:31,558 --> 06:13:33,530
but it's also so I feel like 90 90
percent

14026
06:13:33,530 --> 06:13:33,540
percent
 

14027
06:13:33,540 --> 06:13:37,310
percent
of the matches that I watched in the uh

14028
06:13:37,310 --> 06:13:37,320
of the matches that I watched in the uh
 

14029
06:13:37,320 --> 06:13:39,548
of the matches that I watched in the uh
championships the World Championships

14030
06:13:39,548 --> 06:13:39,558
championships the World Championships
 

14031
06:13:39,558 --> 06:13:43,010
championships the World Championships
where like one team would lead

14032
06:13:43,010 --> 06:13:43,020
where like one team would lead
 

14033
06:13:43,020 --> 06:13:45,948
where like one team would lead
throughout the game

14034
06:13:45,948 --> 06:13:45,958
throughout the game
 

14035
06:13:45,958 --> 06:13:49,190
throughout the game
and then they would be doing so well and

14036
06:13:49,190 --> 06:13:49,200
and then they would be doing so well and
 

14037
06:13:49,200 --> 06:13:50,990
and then they would be doing so well and
then suddenly the other team gets gets

14038
06:13:50,990 --> 06:13:51,000
then suddenly the other team gets gets
 

14039
06:13:51,000 --> 06:13:53,390
then suddenly the other team gets gets
Rayquaza out of sheer luck and it turns

14040
06:13:53,390 --> 06:13:53,400
Rayquaza out of sheer luck and it turns
 

14041
06:13:53,400 --> 06:13:54,910
Rayquaza out of sheer luck and it turns
around

14042
06:13:54,910 --> 06:13:54,920
around
 

14043
06:13:54,920 --> 06:13:58,670
around
completely with such a huge gap that the

14044
06:13:58,670 --> 06:13:58,680
completely with such a huge gap that the
 

14045
06:13:58,680 --> 06:14:00,230
completely with such a huge gap that the
the other team who was doing so well

14046
06:14:00,230 --> 06:14:00,240
the other team who was doing so well
 

14047
06:14:00,240 --> 06:14:02,930
the other team who was doing so well
until that point can't can't possibly do

14048
06:14:02,930 --> 06:14:02,940
until that point can't can't possibly do
 

14049
06:14:02,940 --> 06:14:06,830
until that point can't can't possibly do
anything to fix it and I think there's

14050
06:14:06,830 --> 06:14:06,840
anything to fix it and I think there's
 

14051
06:14:06,840 --> 06:14:09,170
anything to fix it and I think there's
two sides to this on one hand it's great

14052
06:14:09,170 --> 06:14:09,180
two sides to this on one hand it's great
 

14053
06:14:09,180 --> 06:14:12,708
two sides to this on one hand it's great
to have a reason to not give up

14054
06:14:12,708 --> 06:14:12,718
to have a reason to not give up
 

14055
06:14:12,718 --> 06:14:14,868
to have a reason to not give up
because the other group may be in a lead

14056
06:14:14,868 --> 06:14:14,878
because the other group may be in a lead
 

14057
06:14:14,878 --> 06:14:16,610
because the other group may be in a lead
and you're already giving up because

14058
06:14:16,610 --> 06:14:16,620
and you're already giving up because
 

14059
06:14:16,620 --> 06:14:19,730
and you're already giving up because
well there isn't anything to latch on to

14060
06:14:19,730 --> 06:14:19,740
well there isn't anything to latch on to
 

14061
06:14:19,740 --> 06:14:22,128
well there isn't anything to latch on to
to save this so it's good to have

14062
06:14:22,128 --> 06:14:22,138
to save this so it's good to have
 

14063
06:14:22,138 --> 06:14:25,030
to save this so it's good to have
Rayquaza being such like a big effect

14064
06:14:25,030 --> 06:14:25,040
Rayquaza being such like a big effect
 

14065
06:14:25,040 --> 06:14:27,708
Rayquaza being such like a big effect
but I feel like you could have still

14066
06:14:27,708 --> 06:14:27,718
but I feel like you could have still
 

14067
06:14:27,718 --> 06:14:29,208
but I feel like you could have still
kept that

14068
06:14:29,208 --> 06:14:29,218
kept that
 

14069
06:14:29,218 --> 06:14:32,810
kept that
you know that glimpse of hope that you

14070
06:14:32,810 --> 06:14:32,820
you know that glimpse of hope that you
 

14071
06:14:32,820 --> 06:14:35,270
you know that glimpse of hope that you
can turn it around without making it so

14072
06:14:35,270 --> 06:14:35,280
can turn it around without making it so
 

14073
06:14:35,280 --> 06:14:37,850
can turn it around without making it so
extreme maybe nerfing it a little bit to

14074
06:14:37,850 --> 06:14:37,860
extreme maybe nerfing it a little bit to
 

14075
06:14:37,860 --> 06:14:39,770
extreme maybe nerfing it a little bit to
still give the team who was having a

14076
06:14:39,770 --> 06:14:39,780
still give the team who was having a
 

14077
06:14:39,780 --> 06:14:41,390
still give the team who was having a
good lead and who was playing really

14078
06:14:41,390 --> 06:14:41,400
good lead and who was playing really
 

14079
06:14:41,400 --> 06:14:42,830
good lead and who was playing really
well

14080
06:14:42,830 --> 06:14:42,840
well
 

14081
06:14:42,840 --> 06:14:45,530
well
keep their lead now I think it's a bit

14082
06:14:45,530 --> 06:14:45,540
keep their lead now I think it's a bit
 

14083
06:14:45,540 --> 06:14:47,150
keep their lead now I think it's a bit
too much it's good to have something

14084
06:14:47,150 --> 06:14:47,160
too much it's good to have something
 

14085
06:14:47,160 --> 06:14:49,250
too much it's good to have something
that turns it around completely

14086
06:14:49,250 --> 06:14:49,260
that turns it around completely
 

14087
06:14:49,260 --> 06:14:51,048
that turns it around completely
but it shouldn't be a hundred percent

14088
06:14:51,048 --> 06:14:51,058
but it shouldn't be a hundred percent
 

14089

07:06:52,680 --> 07:06:55,190
all Freedom that's the good thing about
that Visa but when I lived in Japan and

16176
07:06:55,190 --> 07:06:55,200
that Visa but when I lived in Japan and
 

16177
07:06:55,200 --> 07:06:57,288
that Visa but when I lived in Japan and
had a different Visa

16178

um in the end
 

16181
07:06:58,820 --> 07:07:02,750
um in the end
uh it was kind of the reason

16182
07:07:02,750 --> 07:07:02,760
uh it was kind of the reason
 

16183
07:07:02,760 --> 07:07:06,830
uh it was kind of the reason
that I left Japan that the limitations

16184
07:07:06,830 --> 07:07:06,840
that I left Japan that the limitations
 

16185
07:07:06,840 --> 07:07:10,430
that I left Japan that the limitations
of the Visa were holding me back more or

16186
07:07:10,430 --> 07:07:10,440
of the Visa were holding me back more or

07:07:11,180 --> 07:07:15,650
less
so yeah it's difficult it's not that

16190
07:07:15,650 --> 07:07:15,660
so yeah it's difficult it's not that
 

16191
07:07:15,660 --> 07:07:18,670
so yeah it's difficult it's not that
easy

16192
07:07:18,670 --> 07:07:18,680

 

16193
07:07:18,680 --> 07:07:21,708

but yeah gotta follow the rules but the

16194
07:07:21,708 --> 07:07:21,718
but yeah gotta follow the rules but the
 

16195
07:07:21,718 --> 07:07:23,448
but yeah gotta follow the rules but the
thing is it's not even easy to get a

16196
07:07:23,448 --> 07:07:23,458
thing is it's not even easy to get a
 

16197
07:07:23,458 --> 07:07:25,430
thing is it's not even easy to get a
Visa in the first place unless you have

16198
07:07:25,430 --> 07:07:25,440
Visa in the first place unless you have
 

16199
07:07:25,440 --> 07:07:28,850
Visa in the first place unless you have
a University degree or you know you're

16200
07:07:28,850 --> 07:07:28,860
a University degree or you know you're
 

16201
07:07:28,860 --> 07:07:32,208
a University degree or you know you're
like a specialist in something

16202
07:07:32,208 --> 07:07:32,218
like a specialist in something
 

16203
07:07:32,218 --> 07:07:34,250
like a specialist in something
um unless you're like you know if you

16204
07:07:34,250 --> 07:07:34,260
um unless you're like you know if you
 

16205
07:07:34,260 --> 07:07:36,048
um unless you're like you know if you
want to teach English I hear it's pretty

16206
07:07:36,048 --> 07:07:36,058
want to teach English I hear it's pretty
 

16207
07:07:36,058 --> 07:07:39,230
want to teach English I hear it's pretty
easy but you still need like a degree or

16208
07:07:39,230 --> 07:07:39,240
easy but you still need like a degree or
 

16209
07:07:39,240 --> 07:07:40,250
easy but you still need like a degree or
something

16210
07:07:40,250 --> 07:07:40,260
something
 

16211
07:07:40,260 --> 07:07:41,990
something
and then it's pretty easy to get a job

16212
07:07:41,990 --> 07:07:42,000
and then it's pretty easy to get a job
 

16213
07:07:42,000 --> 07:07:43,730
and then it's pretty easy to get a job
because they take English helping
