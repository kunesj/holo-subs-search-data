8473
03:59:09,159 --> 03:59:11,990

bring did they well this whole vault is

8474
03:59:11,990 --> 03:59:12,000
bring did they well this whole vault is
 

8475

about like raising plants and [\h__\h] right

8476
03:59:14,710 --> 03:59:14,720
about like raising plants and [\h__\h] right
 

8477
03:59:14,720 --> 03:59:16,229
about like raising plants and [\h__\h] right
right

right
 

8479
03:59:16,239 --> 03:59:19,389
right
so the Mattis is and all that they they

8480
03:59:19,389 --> 03:59:19,399
so the Mattis is and all that they they
 

8481
03:59:19,399 --> 03:59:21,429
so the Mattis is and all that they they
brought them from the outside into the

8482
03:59:21,429 --> 03:59:21,439
brought them from the outside into the
 

8483
03:59:21,439 --> 03:59:23,910
brought them from the outside into the
Vault too for for

8484
03:59:23,910 --> 03:59:23,920

what is that part of the

8486
03:59:27,510 --> 03:59:27,520
what is that part of the
 

8487
03:59:27,520 --> 03:59:29,149
what is that part of the
experiment

8488
03:59:29,149 --> 03:59:29,159
experiment
 

8489
03:59:29,159 --> 03:59:31,429
experiment
but what was the original point of

8490
03:59:31,429 --> 03:59:31,439
but what was the original point of
 

8491
03:59:31,439 --> 03:59:34,269
but what was the original point of
bringing

8493
03:59:34,279 --> 03:59:36,590

them also that they complement our

pest yeah I thought so it must be

8498
03:59:41,149 --> 03:59:41,159
pest yeah I thought so it must be
 

8499
03:59:41,159 --> 03:59:43,030
pest yeah I thought so it must be
something like that something good

8500
03:59:43,030 --> 03:59:43,040
something like that something good
 

8501
03:59:43,040 --> 03:59:44,830
something like that something good
hopefully last lastly mantises will

8502
03:59:44,830 --> 03:59:44,840
hopefully last lastly mantises will
 

8503
03:59:44,840 --> 03:59:46,950
hopefully last lastly mantises will
begin to cannibalize on one another when

self-regulating when prey scars you
 

8509
03:59:51,600 --> 03:59:53,070

would think

8510
03:59:53,070 --> 03:59:53,080
would think

oh is she in the

8918
04:11:53,030 --> 04:11:53,040
oh is she in the
 

8919
04:11:53,040 --> 04:11:56,109
oh is she in the
lab where'd she

8920
04:11:56,109 --> 04:11:56,119
lab where'd she
 

8921
04:11:56,119 --> 04:12:01,309
lab where'd she
go uh

8922
04:12:01,309 --> 04:12:01,319

 

8923

lady
 

8925
04:12:03,199 --> 04:12:08,189
lady
uh ah what you doing good you're here

8926
04:12:08,189 --> 04:12:08,199
uh ah what you doing good you're here
 

8927
04:12:08,199 --> 04:12:10,149
uh ah what you doing good you're here
ready to begin yeah I totally know what

8928
04:12:10,149 --> 04:12:10,159
ready to begin yeah I totally know what
 

8929
04:12:10,159 --> 04:12:12,790
ready to begin yeah I totally know what
I'm doing how can I help time is of the

8930
04:12:12,790 --> 04:12:12,800
I'm doing how can I help time is of the
 

8931
04:12:12,800 --> 04:12:15,030
I'm doing how can I help time is of the
essence so I'll be brief this place is

8932
04:12:15,030 --> 04:12:15,040
essence so I'll be brief this place is
 

8933
04:12:15,040 --> 04:12:16,590
essence so I'll be brief this place is
filled with spores that are toxic to

8934
04:12:16,590 --> 04:12:16,600
filled with spores that are toxic to
 

8935
04:12:16,600 --> 04:12:18,670
filled with spores that are toxic to
humans and we need to get rid of them

8936
04:12:18,670 --> 04:12:18,680
humans and we need to get rid of them
 

8937
04:12:18,680 --> 04:12:20,070
humans and we need to get rid of them
I've pumped The Vault full of a highly

8938
04:12:20,070 --> 04:12:20,080
I've pumped The Vault full of a highly
 

8939
04:12:20,080 --> 04:12:22,070
I've pumped The Vault full of a highly
flammable gas that once ignited should

8940
04:12:22,070 --> 04:12:22,080
flammable gas that once ignited should
 

8941
04:12:22,080 --> 04:12:24,309
flammable gas that once ignited should
destroy the vast majority of spores

8942
04:12:24,309 --> 04:12:24,319
destroy the vast majority of spores
 

8943
04:12:24,319 --> 04:12:26,710
destroy the vast majority of spores
there's one problem though the gas

8944
04:12:26,710 --> 04:12:26,720
there's one problem though the gas
 

8945
04:12:26,720 --> 04:12:29,229
there's one problem though the gas
becomes semi inert on exposure to oxygen

8946
04:12:29,229 --> 04:12:29,239
becomes semi inert on exposure to oxygen
 

8947
04:12:29,239 --> 04:12:30,950
becomes semi inert on exposure to oxygen
meaning the gas will have to be ignited

8948
04:12:30,950 --> 04:12:30,960
meaning the gas will have to be ignited
 

8949
04:12:30,960 --> 04:12:33,389
meaning the gas will have to be ignited
close to where it's being introduced I

8950
04:12:33,389 --> 04:12:33,399
close to where it's being introduced I
 

8951
04:12:33,399 --> 04:12:34,990
close to where it's being introduced I
need you to find the vents where the gas

8952
04:12:34,990 --> 04:12:35,000
need you to find the vents where the gas
 

8953
04:12:35,000 --> 04:12:37,670
need you to find the vents where the gas
is being pumped and ignite it oh and

8954
04:12:37,670 --> 04:12:37,680
is being pumped and ignite it oh and
 

8955
04:12:37,680 --> 04:12:39,750
is being pumped and ignite it oh and
survive the resulting

8956
04:12:39,750 --> 04:12:39,760
survive the resulting
 

8957
04:12:39,760 --> 04:12:44,030
survive the resulting
blast did I see any vents yet I idea

8958
04:12:44,030 --> 04:12:44,040
blast did I see any vents yet I idea
 

8959
04:12:44,040 --> 04:12:46,630
blast did I see any vents yet I idea
where these vents are I set the gas to

8960
04:12:46,630 --> 04:12:46,640
where these vents are I set the gas to
 

8961
04:12:46,640 --> 04:12:48,189
where these vents are I set the gas to
pump into the fist level since that's

8962
04:12:48,189 --> 04:12:48,199
pump into the fist level since that's
 

8963
04:12:48,199 --> 04:12:49,830
pump into the fist level since that's
where the concentration of spores was

8964
04:12:49,830 --> 04:12:49,840
where the concentration of spores was
 

8965
04:12:49,840 --> 04:12:52,070
where the concentration of spores was
highest I'd start looking there okay

8966
04:12:52,070 --> 04:12:52,080
highest I'd start looking there okay
 

8967
04:12:52,080 --> 04:12:53,429
highest I'd start looking there okay
typically these vaults use circular

8968
04:12:53,429 --> 04:12:53,439
typically these vaults use circular
 

8969
04:12:53,439 --> 04:12:55,510
typically these vaults use circular

look for a wall with two of them almost

8972
04:12:57,109 --> 04:12:57,119
look for a wall with two of them almost
 

8973
04:12:57,119 --> 04:12:59,189
look for a wall with two of them almost
side by side okay there's one just

04:12:59,189 --> 04:12:59,199
side by side okay there's one just
 

8975
04:12:59,199 --> 04:13:00,630
side by side okay there's one just
around the corner outside this lab if

8976
04:13:00,630 --> 04:13:00,640
around the corner outside this lab if
 

8977
04:13:00,640 --> 04:13:05,070
around the corner outside this lab if
you need an example oh

8978
04:13:05,070 --> 04:13:05,080

 

8979
04:13:05,080 --> 04:13:07,950

okay we need to find those vents I'm
 

9029
04:14:29,600 --> 04:14:41,109
okay we need to find those vents I'm
sure they will be all over no nope maybe

9030
04:14:41,109 --> 04:14:41,119

 

9031
04:14:41,119 --> 04:14:44,149

9037
04:14:54,920 --> 04:14:58,189

before what am I unlocking I think I

9038
04:14:58,189 --> 04:14:58,199
before what am I unlocking I think I
 

9039
04:14:58,199 --> 04:15:07,590
before what am I unlocking I think I
don't need to do

9040
04:15:07,590 --> 04:15:07,600

 

9041
04:15:07,600 --> 04:15:18,270
