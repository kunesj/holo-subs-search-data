let me
 

667
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,590
let me
uh see there's some confusion apparently

668
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:24,600
uh see there's some confusion apparently
 

669
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,570
uh see there's some confusion apparently
about where the point of no return is

about where the point of no return is
 

671
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:30,710
about where the point of no return is
but I have once again checked

um to make sure to confirm 100

674

um to make sure to confirm 100
 

675
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,310
um to make sure to confirm 100
now the point of where I'm supposed to

676
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:37,320
now the point of where I'm supposed to
 

677
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:41,630
now the point of where I'm supposed to
cut off is where he says the way you get

678
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:41,640
cut off is where he says the way you get
 

679
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,370
cut off is where he says the way you get
the choice between that he says I have

680
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:43,380
the choice between that he says I have
 

681
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,289
the choice between that he says I have
to be ready to face anything whatever

happens
 

685
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,289
happens
and then you get the choice between the

686
00:23:48,289 --> 00:23:48,299
and then you get the choice between the
 

687
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:50,630
and then you get the choice between the
only ways forward or turn back for the

688
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:50,640
only ways forward or turn back for the
 

689

then the reason rinwell was able to

5576
02:44:57,170 --> 02:44:57,180
then the reason rinwell was able to
 

5577
02:44:57,180 --> 02:44:59,090

so then where do you think the zoogle
 

5585
02:45:06,420 --> 02:45:07,849
so then where do you think the zoogle
went

5586
02:45:07,849 --> 02:45:07,859
went
 

5587
02:45:07,859 --> 02:45:10,490

our own lives to save everyone else's

where strength and power determine their
position in the social hierarchy so they

13590

position in the social hierarchy so they
 

13591
06:12:00,718 --> 06:12:03,048
position in the social hierarchy so they

that's what makes them the Guardians of
 

13607
06:12:20,878 --> 06:12:30,288
that's what makes them the Guardians of
all of Rena so to speak

13608
06:12:30,288 --> 06:12:30,298

 

13609
06:12:30,298 --> 06:12:32,090

so alfin have you gained anything from

13614
06:12:37,190 --> 06:12:37,200
so alfin have you gained anything from
 

13615
06:12:37,200 --> 06:12:38,690
so alfin have you gained anything from
all of this

13616
06:12:38,690 --> 06:12:38,700
all of this
 

13617
06:12:38,700 --> 06:12:40,250
all of this
yeah

13618
06:12:40,250 --> 06:12:40,260
yeah
 

13619
06:12:40,260 --> 06:12:42,230
yeah
I think it's made me realize that the

13620
06:12:42,230 --> 06:12:42,240
I think it's made me realize that the
 

13621
06:12:42,240 --> 06:12:45,410
I think it's made me realize that the
Lords were all people too

13622
06:12:45,410 --> 06:12:45,420
Lords were all people too
 

13623
06:12:45,420 --> 06:12:47,208
Lords were all people too
maybe that's because I skipped

13624
06:12:47,208 --> 06:12:47,218
maybe that's because I skipped
 

13625
06:12:47,218 --> 06:12:48,350
maybe that's because I skipped
everything they all had their own

13626
06:12:48,350 --> 06:12:48,360
everything they all had their own
 

13627
06:12:48,360 --> 06:12:51,288
everything they all had their own
circumstances they went through life

13628
06:12:51,288 --> 06:12:51,298
circumstances they went through life
 

13629
06:12:51,298 --> 06:12:53,930
circumstances they went through life
yeah but still just because they had

13630
06:12:53,930 --> 06:12:53,940
yeah but still just because they had
 

13631
06:12:53,940 --> 06:12:56,270
yeah but still just because they had
loved ones in their lives doesn't mean

13632
06:12:56,270 --> 06:12:56,280
loved ones in their lives doesn't mean
 

13633
06:12:56,280 --> 06:12:59,090
loved ones in their lives doesn't mean
I know what they did was horrible I'm

13634
06:12:59,090 --> 06:12:59,100
I know what they did was horrible I'm
 

13635
06:12:59,100 --> 06:13:01,070
I know what they did was horrible I'm
trying to dispute that

13636
06:13:01,070 --> 06:13:01,080
trying to dispute that
 

13637
06:13:01,080 --> 06:13:03,250
trying to dispute that
but at the same time they weren't

13638
06:13:03,250 --> 06:13:03,260
but at the same time they weren't
 

13639
06:13:03,260 --> 06:13:05,810
but at the same time they weren't
incomprehensible monsters either uh no

13640
06:13:05,810 --> 06:13:05,820
incomprehensible monsters either uh no
 

13641
06:13:05,820 --> 06:13:09,190
incomprehensible monsters either uh no
they are individuals

13643
06:13:09,200 --> 06:13:12,788

so I guess what I'm trying to say is

13644
06:13:12,788 --> 06:13:12,798
so I guess what I'm trying to say is
 

13645
06:13:12,798 --> 06:13:14,690
so I guess what I'm trying to say is
you're saying that they weren't bad

13646
06:13:14,690 --> 06:13:14,700
you're saying that they weren't bad
 

13647
06:13:14,700 --> 06:13:16,788
you're saying that they weren't bad
because they were renins or because they

13648
06:13:16,788 --> 06:13:16,798
because they were renins or because they
 

13649
06:13:16,798 --> 06:13:19,010
because they were renins or because they
were terrible monsters

13650
06:13:19,010 --> 06:13:19,020
were terrible monsters
 

13651
06:13:19,020 --> 06:13:21,708
were terrible monsters
but even if they did Terrible Things

13652
06:13:21,708 --> 06:13:21,718
but even if they did Terrible Things
 

13653
06:13:21,718 --> 06:13:23,690
but even if they did Terrible Things
they were still just people they were

13654
06:13:23,690 --> 06:13:23,700
they were still just people they were

nothing more
and yet

14618
06:35:32,990 --> 06:35:33,000
and yet
 

14619
06:35:33,000 --> 06:35:35,990
and yet
um yes I don't I like we have

permissions for a couple of other Tales

14622
06:35:37,610 --> 06:35:37,620
permissions for a couple of other Tales
 

14623
06:35:37,620 --> 06:35:38,990
permissions for a couple of other Tales
of games as far as I know and I haven't

14624
06:35:38,990 --> 06:35:39,000
of games as far as I know and I haven't
 

14625
06:35:39,000 --> 06:35:41,930
of games as far as I know and I haven't
heard yet of any limitations on those so

14626
06:35:41,930 --> 06:35:41,940
heard yet of any limitations on those so
 

14627
06:35:41,940 --> 06:35:43,968
heard yet of any limitations on those so
as far as I know I think we had

14628
06:35:43,968 --> 06:35:43,978
as far as I know I think we had
 

14629
06:35:43,978 --> 06:35:47,750
as far as I know I think we had
permission for uh castle sparia and

14630
06:35:47,750 --> 06:35:47,760
permission for uh castle sparia and
 

14631
06:35:47,760 --> 06:35:50,090
permission for uh castle sparia and
hysteria before and I could probably get

14632
06:35:50,090 --> 06:35:50,100
hysteria before and I could probably get
 

14633
06:35:50,100 --> 06:35:54,170
hysteria before and I could probably get
more permissions if I were where to ask

14634
06:35:54,170 --> 06:35:54,180
more permissions if I were where to ask
 

14635
06:35:54,180 --> 06:35:55,968
more permissions if I were where to ask
and I think this one just really has

14636
06:35:55,968 --> 06:35:55,978
and I think this one just really has
 

14637
06:35:55,978 --> 06:35:57,708
and I think this one just really has
that limitation because it's the newest

14638
06:35:57,708 --> 06:35:57,718
that limitation because it's the newest
 

14639
06:35:57,718 --> 06:35:59,628
that limitation because it's the newest
one out there and

14640
06:35:59,628 --> 06:35:59,638
one out there and
 

14641
06:35:59,638 --> 06:36:02,868
one out there and
um they put a lot of uh work into the

14642
06:36:02,868 --> 06:36:02,878
um they put a lot of uh work into the
 

14643
06:36:02,878 --> 06:36:05,208
um they put a lot of uh work into the
marketing and promotion of the game so

14644
06:36:05,208 --> 06:36:05,218
marketing and promotion of the game so
 

14645
06:36:05,218 --> 06:36:08,810
marketing and promotion of the game so
which obviously I am part of and uh

14646
06:36:08,810 --> 06:36:08,820
which obviously I am part of and uh
 

14647
06:36:08,820 --> 06:36:11,390
which obviously I am part of and uh
therefore one part of promoting and

14648
06:36:11,390 --> 06:36:11,400
therefore one part of promoting and
 

14649
06:36:11,400 --> 06:36:13,190
therefore one part of promoting and
marketing the game is not letting people

14650
06:36:13,190 --> 06:36:13,200
marketing the game is not letting people
 

14651
06:36:13,200 --> 06:36:15,530

15367
06:56:32,580 --> 06:56:35,208
this game in particular I heard it can
be very frustrating now I don't really

15368
06:56:35,208 --> 06:56:35,218
be very frustrating now I don't really
 

15369
06:56:35,218 --> 06:56:37,190
be very frustrating now I don't really
think

15370
06:56:37,190 --> 06:56:37,200
think
 

15371
06:56:37,200 --> 06:56:39,468
think
it's a [\h__\h] combo

15372
06:56:39,468 --> 06:56:39,478
it's a [\h__\h] combo
 

15373
06:56:39,478 --> 06:56:43,128
it's a [\h__\h] combo
whatever just do the normal one coming

15374
06:56:43,128 --> 06:56:43,138
whatever just do the normal one coming
 

15375
06:56:43,138 --> 06:56:45,890
whatever just do the normal one coming
through oh yeah I think all of the

15376
06:56:45,890 --> 06:56:45,900
through oh yeah I think all of the
 

15377
06:56:45,900 --> 06:56:48,048
through oh yeah I think all of the
participants wouldn't be that

15378
06:56:48,048 --> 06:56:48,058
participants wouldn't be that
 

15379
06:56:48,058 --> 06:56:50,270
participants wouldn't be that
competitive and therefore wouldn't care

15380
06:56:50,270 --> 06:56:50,280
competitive and therefore wouldn't care
 

15381
06:56:50,280 --> 06:56:55,270
competitive and therefore wouldn't care
that much

15382
06:56:55,270 --> 06:56:55,280

 

15383
06:56:55,280 --> 06:56:58,010

who knows I would have to test it out I

15384
06:56:58,010 --> 06:56:58,020
who knows I would have to test it out I
 

15385
06:56:58,020 --> 06:57:00,230
who knows I would have to test it out I
guess to see how bad it really is

15386
06:57:00,230 --> 06:57:00,240
guess to see how bad it really is
 

15387
06:57:00,240 --> 06:57:02,750
guess to see how bad it really is
carve through it would be sad though to

06:57:02,750 --> 06:57:02,760
carve through it would be sad though to
 

15389
06:57:02,760 --> 06:57:05,570
carve through it would be sad though to

15403
06:57:19,260 --> 06:57:22,070
and all that that would be just really
really sad

15404
06:57:22,070 --> 06:57:22,080

 

15405
06:57:22,080 --> 06:57:23,868

unplayable if you are in different

15406
06:57:23,868 --> 06:57:23,878
unplayable if you are in different
 

15407
06:57:23,878 --> 06:57:25,850
unplayable if you are in different
regions really well then there you go

15408
06:57:25,850 --> 06:57:25,860
regions really well then there you go
 

15409
06:57:25,860 --> 06:57:27,770
regions really well then there you go
there you have it if you say it's

15410
06:57:27,770 --> 06:57:27,780
there you have it if you say it's
 

15411
06:57:27,780 --> 06:57:30,468
there you have it if you say it's
unplayable

15412
06:57:30,468 --> 06:57:30,478
unplayable
 

15413
06:57:30,478 --> 06:57:33,350
unplayable
yeah

15414
06:57:33,350 --> 06:57:33,360
yeah
 

15415
06:57:33,360 --> 06:57:35,628
yeah
pretty bad

15416
06:57:35,628 --> 06:57:35,638
pretty bad
 

15417
06:57:35,638 --> 06:57:37,548
pretty bad
well that's the problem because we are

15418
06:57:37,548 --> 06:57:37,558
well that's the problem because we are
 

15419
06:57:37,558 --> 06:57:39,770
well that's the problem because we are
literally all over the world there is a

15420
06:57:39,770 --> 06:57:39,780
literally all over the world there is a
 

15421
06:57:39,780 --> 06:57:41,990
literally all over the world there is a
whole lot of English members who live on

15422
06:57:41,990 --> 06:57:42,000
whole lot of English members who live on
 

15423
06:57:42,000 --> 06:57:44,208
whole lot of English members who live on
one side of the globe whole life member

15424
06:57:44,208 --> 06:57:44,218
one side of the globe whole life member
 

15425
06:57:44,218 --> 06:57:46,690
one side of the globe whole life member
who lives in in the middle of the club

15426
06:57:46,690 --> 06:57:46,700
who lives in in the middle of the club
 

15427
06:57:46,700 --> 06:57:49,250
who lives in in the middle of the club
and all that members living on the other

15428
06:57:49,250 --> 06:57:49,260
and all that members living on the other
 

15429
06:57:49,260 --> 06:57:51,410
and all that members living on the other
side of the globe

15430
06:57:51,410 --> 06:57:51,420
side of the globe
 

15431
06:57:51,420 --> 06:57:54,830
side of the globe
so that's problematic

15432
06:57:54,830 --> 06:57:54,840
so that's problematic
 

15433
06:57:54,840 --> 06:57:56,390
so that's problematic
and yes I am in the middle of your rep

15434
06:57:56,390 --> 06:57:56,400
and yes I am in the middle of your rep
 

15435
06:57:56,400 --> 06:58:15,490
and yes I am in the middle of your rep
is in the middle yes that's how it is

15436
06:58:15,490 --> 06:58:15,500

 

15437
06:58:15,500 --> 06:58:18,170

me as well I was shocked when I first

15438
06:58:18,170 --> 06:58:18,180
me as well I was shocked when I first
 

15439
06:58:18,180 --> 06:58:20,690
me as well I was shocked when I first
found out that uh

15440
06:58:20,690 --> 06:58:20,700
found out that uh
 

15441
06:58:20,700 --> 06:58:23,150
found out that uh
the continent that is in the middle of

15442
06:58:23,150 --> 06:58:23,160
the continent that is in the middle of
 

15443
06:58:23,160 --> 06:58:25,628
the continent that is in the middle of
the map varies by

15444
06:58:25,628 --> 06:58:25,638
the map varies by
 

15445
06:58:25,638 --> 06:58:30,350
the map varies by
where where you are at

15446
06:58:30,350 --> 06:58:30,360

 

15447
06:58:30,360 --> 06:58:33,110

I always spot zero everywhere it just

15448
06:58:33,110 --> 06:58:33,120
I always spot zero everywhere it just
 

15449
06:58:33,120 --> 06:58:34,490
I always spot zero everywhere it just
made sense to me

15450
06:58:34,490 --> 06:58:34,500
made sense to me
 

15451
06:58:34,500 --> 06:58:39,708
made sense to me
apparently it's not

15452
06:58:39,708 --> 06:58:39,718

 

15453
06:58:39,718 --> 06:58:43,310

but I mean if you think of it from a

15454
06:58:43,310 --> 06:58:43,320
but I mean if you think of it from a
 

15455
06:58:43,320 --> 06:58:47,150
but I mean if you think of it from a
time zone point of view Europe is in the

15456
06:58:47,150 --> 06:58:47,160
time zone point of view Europe is in the
 

15457
06:58:47,160 --> 06:58:48,830
time zone point of view Europe is in the
middle so

15458
06:58:48,830 --> 06:58:48,840
middle so
 

15459
06:58:48,840 --> 06:58:51,830
middle so
it does make a lot of sense to put

15460
06:58:51,830 --> 06:58:51,840
it does make a lot of sense to put
 

15461
06:58:51,840 --> 06:58:55,430
it does make a lot of sense to put
Europe in the middle

15462
06:58:55,430 --> 06:58:55,440

 

15463
06:58:55,440 --> 06:58:57,548

for all we know perhaps we're close to

07:07:36,948 --> 07:07:36,958
for all we know perhaps we're close to
 

15819
07:07:36,958 --> 07:07:38,448
for all we know perhaps we're close to
the spot where all that energy was

15820
07:07:38,448 --> 07:07:38,458
the spot where all that energy was
 

15821

so you think it might have been the
 

15825
07:07:41,340 --> 07:07:43,368
so you think it might have been the
energy itself that was responsible for

07:07:43,368 --> 07:07:43,378
energy itself that was responsible for
 

15827
07:07:43,378 --> 07:07:47,090
energy itself that was responsible for
that Vision we just saw but how and why

that Vision we just saw but how and why
we have no way of knowing maybe it's not

15830
07:07:49,910 --> 07:07:49,920
we have no way of knowing maybe it's not
 

15831
07:07:49,920 --> 07:07:54,048
we have no way of knowing maybe it's not
even as deliberate as all that
