1867
00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:14,140

thought, ``Oh, maybe I should sing another song,'' and then I started

1868
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:14,150
thought, ``Oh, maybe I should sing another song,'' and then I started
 

1869
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:16,240
thought, ``Oh, maybe I should sing another song,'' and then I started
playing something like ``Ordinary'',

1870
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:16,250
playing something like ``Ordinary'',
 

1871
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:18,250
playing something like ``Ordinary'',
