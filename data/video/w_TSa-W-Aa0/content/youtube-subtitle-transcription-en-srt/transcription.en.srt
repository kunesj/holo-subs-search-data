629
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,890
solutions to and I was I when I was on
the plane I couldn't even look up

so that was a problem
 

635
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,810
so that was a problem
um uh here I thought this would be maybe

636
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:05,820
um uh here I thought this would be maybe
 

637
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,270
um uh here I thought this would be maybe
like a quest or so because you go in and

638
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:08,280
like a quest or so because you go in and
 

639
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,029
like a quest or so because you go in and
and he's like oh hey I'm doing a lesson

640
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:11,039
and he's like oh hey I'm doing a lesson
 

641
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,310
and he's like oh hey I'm doing a lesson
if you want you can stay and listen and

642
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:13,320
if you want you can stay and listen and

00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,990
if you want you can stay and listen and
I I waited and I was listening but

644
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:15,000
I I waited and I was listening but
 

645
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,289
I I waited and I was listening but
nothing was happening so I guess I guess

646
00:22:18,289 --> 00:22:18,299
nothing was happening so I guess I guess
 

647
00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:20,690
nothing was happening so I guess I guess
it's like they encourage you to come in

648
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:20,700
it's like they encourage you to come in
 

649
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,090
it's like they encourage you to come in

but then then nothing really happened it
 

651
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,010
but then then nothing really happened it

this this was something I found in the
 

683
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,590
this this was something I found in the
middle of nowhere

684
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:09,600
middle of nowhere
 

685
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,990
middle of nowhere
and I don't know I didn't know what it

686
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:12,000
and I don't know I didn't know what it
 

687
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,409
and I don't know I didn't know what it
means I think it was in the Gerudo

688
00:23:15,409 --> 00:23:15,419
means I think it was in the Gerudo
 

689
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:17,270
means I think it was in the Gerudo
um lands

690
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:17,280
um lands
 

691
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,010
um lands
in a cave

692
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:19,020
in a cave
 

693
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,890
in a cave
no maybe not gorillo I'm not sure and I

694
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:21,900
no maybe not gorillo I'm not sure and I
 

695
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,850

I honestly I didn't know what that meant

696
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:25,860
I honestly I didn't know what that meant
 

697
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:29,029
I honestly I didn't know what that meant
because there was nothing like close by

698
00:23:29,029 --> 00:23:29,039
because there was nothing like close by
 

699
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,149
because there was nothing like close by
that seemed to make sense with this yeah

700

screenshots here but I struggled I think
I struggled a lot with this shrine

918
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:56,700

 

919
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,210

no actually not really I cheesed because

920
00:28:59,210 --> 00:28:59,220
no actually not really I cheesed because
 

921
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,590
no actually not really I cheesed because
I didn't understand it and I couldn't

922
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:00,600
I didn't understand it and I couldn't
 

923
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,070
I didn't understand it and I couldn't
look it up I chased this shrine

924
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:04,080

00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:06,120
um a lot I don't think I did it in any
 

927
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:10,370
um a lot I don't think I did it in any
intended ways it's hard to explain now

928
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:10,380
intended ways it's hard to explain now
 

929
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:13,029
intended ways it's hard to explain now
um

930
00:29:13,029 --> 00:29:13,039

 

931
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,830

I think and I don't know if you guys saw

932
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:15,840
I think and I don't know if you guys saw
 

933
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,230
I think and I don't know if you guys saw
the shrine before but you're supposed to

934
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:18,240
the shrine before but you're supposed to
 

935
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,710
the shrine before but you're supposed to
bring one plate with you I think

936
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:21,720
bring one plate with you I think
 

937
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,049
bring one plate with you I think
throughout the whole Shrine and attach

938
00:29:24,049 --> 00:29:24,059
throughout the whole Shrine and attach
 

939
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:28,250
throughout the whole Shrine and attach
it in different ways to first I think

940
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:28,260
it in different ways to first I think
 

941
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,409
it in different ways to first I think
like a static bridge but then later like

942
00:29:30,409 --> 00:29:30,419
like a static bridge but then later like
 

943
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:32,210
like a static bridge but then later like
moving stuff

944
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:32,220
moving stuff
 

945
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:32,990
moving stuff
um

946
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:33,000
um
 

947
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,690
um
and and then I didn't bring it

948
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:35,700
and and then I didn't bring it
 

949
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,850
and and then I didn't bring it
um because the second there's like three

950
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:37,860
um because the second there's like three
 

951
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,710
um because the second there's like three
stages and the second stage I kind of

952
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:39,720
stages and the second stage I kind of
 

953
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,570
stages and the second stage I kind of
cheesed but for the third stage which is

954
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:41,580
cheesed but for the third stage which is
 

955
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:44,090
cheesed but for the third stage which is
this one I realized oh wait I really

956
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:44,100
this one I realized oh wait I really
 

957
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,350
this one I realized oh wait I really
need

958
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:45,360
need
 

959
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,049
need
the platform now but I don't want to go

960
00:29:48,049 --> 00:29:48,059
the platform now but I don't want to go
 

961
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:50,870
the platform now but I don't want to go
back and undo my choosing because it was

962
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:50,880
back and undo my choosing because it was
 

963
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,330
back and undo my choosing because it was
already so difficult

964
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:53,340
already so difficult
 

965
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,370
already so difficult
um this Shrine is in the middle of

966
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:55,380
um this Shrine is in the middle of
 

967
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,750
um this Shrine is in the middle of
nowhere I normally should probably

968
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:56,760
nowhere I normally should probably
 

969
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,029
nowhere I normally should probably
shouldn't have done it uh yet it wasn't

970
00:29:59,029 --> 00:29:59,039
shouldn't have done it uh yet it wasn't
 

971
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,250
shouldn't have done it uh yet it wasn't
really in the path of anything that made

972
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:01,260
really in the path of anything that made
 

973
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,350
really in the path of anything that made
sense yet anyway I was really teasing it

974
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:03,360
sense yet anyway I was really teasing it
 

975
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,110
sense yet anyway I was really teasing it
that's just what I wanted to say

976
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:05,120
that's just what I wanted to say
 

977
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,029
that's just what I wanted to say
especially this last present

978
00:30:08,029 --> 00:30:08,039
especially this last present
 

979
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:12,169
especially this last present
did a lot of time uh removal and it's

980
00:30:12,169 --> 00:30:12,179
did a lot of time uh removal and it's
 

981
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:14,389
did a lot of time uh removal and it's
not supposed I don't think no I don't

982
00:30:14,389 --> 00:30:14,399
not supposed I don't think no I don't
 

983
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:15,889
not supposed I don't think no I don't
think it's supposed it didn't it didn't

984
00:30:15,889 --> 00:30:15,899
think it's supposed it didn't it didn't
 

985
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:17,570
think it's supposed it didn't it didn't
feel right it was not supposed to be

986
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:17,580
feel right it was not supposed to be
 

987
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:21,830
feel right it was not supposed to be
like that

988
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:21,840

 

989
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,250

I'm telling you and here somehow I ended

990
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:25,260
I'm telling you and here somehow I ended
 

991
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:28,370
I'm telling you and here somehow I ended
up on top of this mountain

992
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:28,380
up on top of this mountain
 

993
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:31,190
up on top of this mountain
um I don't know why I was just exploring

994
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:31,200
um I don't know why I was just exploring
 

995
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,730
um I don't know why I was just exploring
I think and there's this like heat and

996
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:34,740
I think and there's this like heat and
 

997
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,730
I think and there's this like heat and
cold test

998
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:36,740
cold test
 

999
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,630
cold test
uh which

1000
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:38,640
uh which
 

1001
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,750
uh which
also was interesting

1002
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:40,760
also was interesting
 

1003
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,130
also was interesting
behold the sun is sinking behind the

1004
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:43,140
behold the sun is sinking behind the
 

1005
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,769
behold the sun is sinking behind the
Western Horizon

1006
00:30:45,769 --> 00:30:45,779
Western Horizon
 

1007
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:48,230
Western Horizon
and uh

1008
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:48,240
and uh
 

1009
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,510
and uh
I think there's like a lot of like

1010
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:50,520
I think there's like a lot of like
 

1011
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,310
I think there's like a lot of like
platforms on the ground

1012
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:52,320
platforms on the ground
 

1013
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,430
platforms on the ground
that can help you to build something I

1014
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:55,440
that can help you to build something I
 

1015
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,630
that can help you to build something I
think because otherwise I don't know why

1016
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:56,640
think because otherwise I don't know why
 

1017
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,950
think because otherwise I don't know why
the stuff would be there there's like

1018
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:57,960
the stuff would be there there's like
 

1019
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,649
the stuff would be there there's like
those those like sticky things that you

1020
00:31:00,649 --> 00:31:00,659
those those like sticky things that you
 

1021
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:03,529
those those like sticky things that you
can stick into any anything and a lot of

1022
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:03,539
can stick into any anything and a lot of
 

1023
00:31:03,539 --> 00:31:04,970
can stick into any anything and a lot of
platforms and you could probably build

1024
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:04,980
platforms and you could probably build
 

1025
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:09,169
platforms and you could probably build
yourself like a shade thingy

1026
00:31:09,169 --> 00:31:09,179
yourself like a shade thingy
 

1027
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:11,690
yourself like a shade thingy
for the heat test

1028
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:11,700
for the heat test
 

1029
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,310
for the heat test
and you could probably also build

1030
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:13,320
and you could probably also build
 

1031
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,690
and you could probably also build
yourself a platform to put a fire on top

1032
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:16,700
yourself a platform to put a fire on top
 

1033
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,669
yourself a platform to put a fire on top
because the

1034
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:19,679
because the
 

1035
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,130
because the
place where link has to stand on you

1036
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:22,140
place where link has to stand on you
 

1037
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:25,250
place where link has to stand on you
cannot put a fire there

1038
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:25,260
cannot put a fire there
 

1039

2417
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:56,630
like it it seems like a difficult
challenge but I mean that they can

2418
01:07:56,630 --> 01:07:56,640
challenge but I mean that they can
 

2419
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:58,010
challenge but I mean that they can
probably figure something out if they

2420
01:07:58,010 --> 01:07:58,020
probably figure something out if they
 

2421
01:07:58,020 --> 01:07:59,329
probably figure something out if they
want to

2422
01:07:59,329 --> 01:07:59,339
want to
 

2423
01:07:59,339 --> 01:08:02,089
want to
because I I think they see

2424
01:08:02,089 --> 01:08:02,099
because I I think they see
 

2425
01:08:02,099 --> 01:08:05,990
because I I think they see
the difficult like the possibility of

2426
01:08:05,990 --> 01:08:06,000
the difficult like the possibility of
 

2427
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,930
the difficult like the possibility of
lots of criticism

2428
01:08:08,930 --> 01:08:08,940
lots of criticism
 

2429
01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:11,630
lots of criticism
if they make him like talk a lot and if

2430
01:08:11,630 --> 01:08:11,640
if they make him like talk a lot and if
 

2431
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:14,630
if they make him like talk a lot and if
they completely change his personality

2432
01:08:14,630 --> 01:08:14,640
they completely change his personality
 

2433
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:18,110
they completely change his personality
into like a really energetic let's go

2437
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:26,329
type of character like nobody wants it I
think they would be aware of that

2438
01:08:26,329 --> 01:08:26,339
think they would be aware of that
 

2439
01:08:26,339 --> 01:08:28,309
think they would be aware of that
that's like

2440
01:08:28,309 --> 01:08:28,319
that's like
 

2441
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:33,650

10427
04:54:16,020 --> 04:54:23,810

oh there's something here maybe

10428
04:54:23,810 --> 04:54:23,820

 

10429
04:54:23,820 --> 04:54:31,208

not

10430
04:54:31,208 --> 04:54:31,218

 

10431
04:54:31,218 --> 04:54:34,128

does it make sense to

10432
04:54:34,128 --> 04:54:34,138
does it make sense to
 

10433
04:54:34,138 --> 04:54:36,350
does it make sense to
turn it like this

10434
04:54:36,350 --> 04:54:36,360
turn it like this
 

10435
04:54:36,360 --> 04:54:49,510
turn it like this
maybe the timing was kind of above

10436
04:54:49,510 --> 04:54:49,520

 

10437
04:54:49,520 --> 04:54:54,840

there we have it I like sauce

10438
04:54:54,840 --> 04:54:54,850

I have to stop the wheels properly too

10444
04:55:04,910 --> 04:55:04,920
I have to stop the wheels properly too
 

10445
04:55:04,920 --> 04:55:06,470
I have to stop the wheels properly too
but

10446
04:55:06,470 --> 04:55:06,480
but
 

10447
04:55:06,480 --> 04:55:08,750
but
that was long enough however can we

10448
04:55:08,750 --> 04:55:08,760
that was long enough however can we
 

10449
04:55:08,760 --> 04:55:11,150
that was long enough however can we
actually stop it though ah wait if we

10450
04:55:11,150 --> 04:55:11,160
actually stop it though ah wait if we
 

10451
04:55:11,160 --> 04:55:12,530
actually stop it though ah wait if we
just turn it

10452
04:55:12,530 --> 04:55:12,540
just turn it
 

10453
04:55:12,540 --> 04:55:16,970
just turn it
so that it's like at the same spot

10454
04:55:16,970 --> 04:55:16,980

 

10455
04:55:16,980 --> 04:55:19,788

would that help

10456
04:55:19,788 --> 04:55:19,798
would that help
 

10457
04:55:19,798 --> 04:55:24,110
would that help
does that make sense

10458
04:55:24,110 --> 04:55:24,120

 

10459
04:55:24,120 --> 04:55:28,430

mine that's not quite as good

10460
04:55:28,430 --> 04:55:28,440

 

10461
04:55:28,440 --> 04:55:30,350

yeah aligned

10462
04:55:30,350 --> 04:55:30,360
yeah aligned
 

10463
04:55:30,360 --> 04:55:32,990

10467
04:55:36,420 --> 04:55:39,708

okay so this is now always

10468
04:55:39,708 --> 04:55:39,718
okay so this is now always
 

10469
04:55:39,718 --> 04:55:45,070
okay so this is now always
send out the light hopefully

10470
04:55:45,070 --> 04:55:45,080

 

10471
04:55:45,080 --> 04:55:48,288

it no but it seems like it doesn't have

10472
04:55:48,288 --> 04:55:48,298
it no but it seems like it doesn't have
 

10473
04:55:48,298 --> 04:55:52,490
it no but it seems like it doesn't have
to

10474

10475
04:55:52,500 --> 04:55:54,170

10476
04:55:54,170 --> 04:55:54,180

10481
04:56:04,860 --> 04:56:07,770

I think the tower is probably here
 

13117
06:15:36,420 --> 06:15:38,810
I think the tower is probably here
that's why I marked it

13118
06:15:38,810 --> 06:15:38,820
that's why I marked it
 

13119
06:15:38,820 --> 06:15:40,070
that's why I marked it
so

13120
06:15:40,070 --> 06:15:40,080
so
 

13121
06:15:40,080 --> 06:15:42,288
so
we'll go to the next Tower and then from

13122
06:15:42,288 --> 06:15:42,298
we'll go to the next Tower and then from
 

13123
06:15:42,298 --> 06:15:44,570
we'll go to the next Tower and then from
that Tower maybe we can glinder from the

13124
06:15:44,570 --> 06:15:44,580
that Tower maybe we can glinder from the
 

13125
06:15:44,580 --> 06:15:51,350
that Tower maybe we can glinder from the
lab you think so

13126

13127
06:15:51,360 --> 06:15:59,510

luminous
that one wasn't luminous at all but I

14054
06:45:57,470 --> 06:45:57,480
that one wasn't luminous at all but I
 

14055
06:45:57,480 --> 06:46:01,670
that one wasn't luminous at all but I
guess because he wasn't in a cave

14056
06:46:01,670 --> 06:46:01,680

 

14057
06:46:01,680 --> 06:46:04,070

it wasn't luminous because of that way I

it wasn't luminous because of that way I

it wasn't luminous because of that way I
saw like some Amber chilling
