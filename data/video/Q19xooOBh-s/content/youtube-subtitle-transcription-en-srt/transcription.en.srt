00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,410
well I definitely checked out this area
that's for sure and then I flew over

232
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:18,420
that's for sure and then I flew over
 

233
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,350
that's for sure and then I flew over
here or or did I

234
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:21,360
here or or did I
 

235
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,090
here or or did I
yeah I did

236
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:23,100
yeah I did
 

237
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,949
yeah I did
or did I

238
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:24,959
or did I
 

239
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,630
or did I
one of those flower Islands because

240
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:26,640
one of those flower Islands because
 

241
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,790
one of those flower Islands because
apparently there's more but I checked it

242
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:28,800
apparently there's more but I checked it
 

243
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,990
apparently there's more but I checked it
out and I saw yo this is probably

244
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:30,000
out and I saw yo this is probably
 

245
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,509
out and I saw yo this is probably
related to the story later

246
00:10:32,509 --> 00:10:32,519
related to the story later
 

247
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:35,110
related to the story later
um then I think

248
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:35,120
um then I think
 

249
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,750
um then I think
here or here and I'm probably here that

250
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:38,760
here or here and I'm probably here that
 

251
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,870
here or here and I'm probably here that
was uh or that oh no maybe in the lower

252
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:41,880
was uh or that oh no maybe in the lower
 

253
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,829
was uh or that oh no maybe in the lower
level there was another construct

254
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:44,839
level there was another construct
 

255
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,190
level there was another construct
uh big boss monster but

256
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:49,200
uh big boss monster but
 

257
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,949
uh big boss monster but
I tried fighting it and that one is

258
00:10:51,949 --> 00:10:51,959
I tried fighting it and that one is
 

259
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:55,790
I tried fighting it and that one is
level two I couldn't kill that one that

260
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:55,800
level two I couldn't kill that one that
 

261
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,430
level two I couldn't kill that one that
one was difficult

262
00:10:58,430 --> 00:10:58,440
one was difficult
 

263
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,210
one was difficult
strong a one one shot me every [\h__\h]

264
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:02,220
strong a one one shot me every [\h__\h]
 

265
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,509
strong a one one shot me every [\h__\h]
time like the first phase is okay and

266
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:05,519
time like the first phase is okay and
 

267
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,389
time like the first phase is okay and
then in the second phase it like is up

268
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:08,399
then in the second phase it like is up
 

269
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,650
then in the second phase it like is up
in the sky and you have to fly up

270
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:12,660

 

271
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,329

it was difficult

272
00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:14,339
it was difficult
 

273
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:16,190
it was difficult
um yeah but I did some exploring on the

274
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:16,200
um yeah but I did some exploring on the
 

275
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,470
um yeah but I did some exploring on the
islands I

276
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:18,480
islands I
 

277
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,090
islands I
I've uh

278
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:20,100
I've uh
 

279
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,430
I've uh
where was this

280
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:22,440
where was this
 

281
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,130
where was this
I went to an island

282
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:25,140
I went to an island
 

283
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,530
I went to an island
no that is also maybe here I don't even

284
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:27,540
no that is also maybe here I don't even
 

285
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,870
no that is also maybe here I don't even
know I went to an island where there's a

286
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:29,880
know I went to an island where there's a
 

287
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,790
know I went to an island where there's a
shrine but it's missing the stone and

288
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:31,800
shrine but it's missing the stone and
 

289
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,250
shrine but it's missing the stone and
you have to bring the Stone from one

290
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:34,260
you have to bring the Stone from one
 

291
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,829
you have to bring the Stone from one
Island to another possibly with a

292
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:36,839
Island to another possibly with a
 

293
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:38,750
Island to another possibly with a
torpedo because that's why the Torpedoes

294
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:38,760
torpedo because that's why the Torpedoes
 

295
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,410
torpedo because that's why the Torpedoes
are placed there probably but that was

296
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:41,420
are placed there probably but that was
 

297
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,930
are placed there probably but that was
too difficult

298
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:44,940
too difficult
 

299
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,389
too difficult
um so I failed at that I was like I'll

300
00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:47,399
um so I failed at that I was like I'll
 

301
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:49,310
um so I failed at that I was like I'll
do this another time

302
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:49,320
do this another time
 

303
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:54,050
do this another time
what is it

304
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:54,060

 

305
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,910

no I don't [\h__\h] know that since I

306
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:55,920
no I don't [\h__\h] know that since I
 

307
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,230
no I don't [\h__\h] know that since I
didn't activate it yet it's probably not

308
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:57,240
didn't activate it yet it's probably not
 

309
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:02,750
didn't activate it yet it's probably not
on the map yet the same thing I found

310
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:02,760

 

311
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,390

um was it here

312
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:05,400
um was it here
 

313
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,030
um was it here
[Music]

314
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:08,040
[Music]
 

315
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,970
[Music]
yeah yeah probably was probably the

316
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:10,980
yeah yeah probably was probably the
 

317
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,949
yeah yeah probably was probably the
shrine that had the same thing you had

318
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:12,959
shrine that had the same thing you had
 

319
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,190
shrine that had the same thing you had
to find uh you had to bring the stone to

320
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:16,200
to find uh you had to bring the stone to
 

321
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,650
to find uh you had to bring the stone to
the uh Shrine but this one was a bit

322
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:18,660
the uh Shrine but this one was a bit
 

323
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,769
the uh Shrine but this one was a bit
easier because the stone was in a cave

324
00:12:21,769 --> 00:12:21,779
easier because the stone was in a cave
 

325
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:24,949
easier because the stone was in a cave
and you had to bring it up that was a

326
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:24,959
and you had to bring it up that was a
 

327
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,410
and you had to bring it up that was a
bit easier than sending it over a

328
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:27,420
bit easier than sending it over a
 

329
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,810
bit easier than sending it over a
freaking flying Island yeah I'm using

330
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:29,820
freaking flying Island yeah I'm using
 

331
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,030
freaking flying Island yeah I'm using
markers so that I kind of know this one

332
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:32,040
markers so that I kind of know this one
 

333
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,670
markers so that I kind of know this one
I placed because I know now that I

334
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:34,680
I placed because I know now that I
 

335
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,230
I placed because I know now that I
didn't attempt it but there is one of

336
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:36,240
didn't attempt it but there is one of
 

337
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,230
didn't attempt it but there is one of
those Horsemen

338

to throw both of his arms at me

512
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:27,000
to throw both of his arms at me
 

513
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,269
to throw both of his arms at me
I would Dodge them at some point

514
00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:29,279
I would Dodge them at some point
 

515
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,449
I would Dodge them at some point
perfectly always

516
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:31,459
perfectly always
 

517
00:16:31,459 --> 00:16:34,430
perfectly always
then I because I noticed when he does

518
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:34,440
then I because I noticed when he does
 

519
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,769
then I because I noticed when he does
that right after he picks up his arms

520
00:16:36,769 --> 00:16:36,779
that right after he picks up his arms
 

521
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:37,970
that right after he picks up his arms
from the ground

522
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:37,980
from the ground
 

523
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,269
from the ground
leading him to

524
00:16:40,269 --> 00:16:40,279
leading him to
 

525
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:43,930
leading him to
lower his platforms

526
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:43,940
lower his platforms
 

527
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,730
lower his platforms
basically really to the ground but only

528
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:46,740
basically really to the ground but only
 

529
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,730
basically really to the ground but only
for one second so I always waited for

530
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:49,740
for one second so I always waited for
 

531
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,430
for one second so I always waited for
that moment to climb up in that one

532
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:52,440
that moment to climb up in that one
 

533
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,870
that moment to climb up in that one
second but even that uh eight out of 10

534
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:56,880
second but even that uh eight out of 10
 

535
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,050
second but even that uh eight out of 10
times it would fail

536
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:00,060
times it would fail
 

537
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,069
times it would fail
because I would have to anticipate

538
00:17:03,069 --> 00:17:03,079
because I would have to anticipate
 

539
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:06,230
because I would have to anticipate
exactly on which centimeter of the

540
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:06,240
exactly on which centimeter of the
 

541
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,689
exactly on which centimeter of the
ground the platform is gonna land on

542
00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:08,699
ground the platform is gonna land on
 

543
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:11,630
ground the platform is gonna land on
like where he would where he would lean

544
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:11,640
like where he would where he would lean
 

545
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,730
like where he would where he would lean
himself on

546
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:13,740
himself on
 

547
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,350
himself on
um which is really difficult to

548
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:15,360
um which is really difficult to
 

549
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,270
um which is really difficult to
anticipate

550
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:17,280
anticipate
 

551
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,350
anticipate
um

552
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:18,360
um
 

553
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:22,630
um
okay it was more like 18 out of 20 times

554
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:22,640
okay it was more like 18 out of 20 times
 

555
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,730
okay it was more like 18 out of 20 times
but like two times I made it and I made

556
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:25,740
but like two times I made it and I made
 

557
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,470
but like two times I made it and I made
the most out of it I would jump on

558
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:27,480
the most out of it I would jump on
 

559
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,310
the most out of it I would jump on
immediately and and do my best to get

560
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:31,320
immediately and and do my best to get
 

561
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:36,190
immediately and and do my best to get
all those hits in as much as I could

562
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:36,200

 

563
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:41,029

it was so so frustrating

564
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:41,039
it was so so frustrating
 

565
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,890
it was so so frustrating
um and after I did that I was like [\h__\h]

566
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:42,900
um and after I did that I was like [\h__\h]
 

567
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,870
um and after I did that I was like [\h__\h]
this [\h__\h] I need more bombs but I could

568
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:44,880
this [\h__\h] I need more bombs but I could
 

569
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,390
this [\h__\h] I need more bombs but I could
not find any bombs eventually I also ran

570
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:47,400
not find any bombs eventually I also ran
 

571
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,029
not find any bombs eventually I also ran
out of arrows elsewhere like man I need

572
00:17:50,029 --> 00:17:50,039
out of arrows elsewhere like man I need
 

573
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:52,150
out of arrows elsewhere like man I need
bombs and arrows

574
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:52,160
bombs and arrows
 

575
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,990
bombs and arrows
uh

576
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:54,000
uh
 

577
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,490
uh
yeah and then after spending like three

578
00:17:58,490 --> 00:17:58,500
yeah and then after spending like three
 

579
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,549
yeah and then after spending like three
hours in the mountains exploring looking

00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:01,559
hours in the mountains exploring looking
 

581
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:07,370
hours in the mountains exploring looking
for Meaningful things and clocks

582
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:07,380

609
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,669
but it was so expensive but I really
needed it because I was suddenly from

needed it because I was suddenly from
 

611
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:49,789

100 down to zero when you're like 100

612
00:18:49,789 --> 00:18:49,799
100 down to zero when you're like 100

turns out you do have to be stingy with
 

619
00:18:57,299 --> 00:18:58,730
turns out you do have to be stingy with
them because then quickly you run out of

620
00:18:58,730 --> 00:18:58,740
them because then quickly you run out of
 

621
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,789
them because then quickly you run out of
arrows when you when you rely too much

622
00:19:01,789 --> 00:19:01,799
arrows when you when you rely too much
 

623
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:04,610
arrows when you when you rely too much
on them then so I went on the ground and

624
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:04,620
on them then so I went on the ground and
 

625
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,110
on them then so I went on the ground and
I explored a little bit underground and

00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:06,120
I explored a little bit underground and
 

627
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,510
I explored a little bit underground and
I was shocked

628
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:08,520
I was shocked
 

629
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,230

uh and then he started he tried to fight
the other one but they were a little bit

980
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:52,020
the other one but they were a little bit
 

981
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,810
the other one but they were a little bit
too far from each other so he couldn't

982
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:53,820
too far from each other so he couldn't
 

983
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,490
too far from each other so he couldn't
reach so well

984
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:55,500
reach so well
 

985
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,029
reach so well
um

986
00:26:58,029 --> 00:26:58,039

 

987
00:26:58,039 --> 00:27:01,669

yeah I know I know you can take pictures

988
00:27:01,669 --> 00:27:01,679
yeah I know I know you can take pictures
 

989
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,130
yeah I know I know you can take pictures
thinking but this is easier and faster

990
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:04,140
thinking but this is easier and faster
 

991
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,930
thinking but this is easier and faster
you just have to press one screenshot

um eventually I figured out a way a

996
00:27:10,789 --> 00:27:10,799
um eventually I figured out a way a
 

997
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,690
um eventually I figured out a way a
technique a strategy to do it without

998
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:13,700
technique a strategy to do it without
 

999
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:16,549
technique a strategy to do it without
getting Frozen it was a bit difficult

getting Frozen it was a bit difficult
but you figure it out eventually

1002
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:19,620
but you figure it out eventually
 

1003
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,330
but you figure it out eventually
um

1004
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:20,340
um
 

1005
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:23,149
um

00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:24,120
difficult
 

1009
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,630
difficult

1010
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:26,640
yeah I tried for a moment I tried the
 

1011
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,730
yeah I tried for a moment I tried the
ascending thing but it didn't didn't

1012
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:28,740
ascending thing but it didn't didn't
 

1013

you'll reach that structure
 

12677
06:26:08,940 --> 06:26:14,150
you'll reach that structure
was it really in a circle like this
