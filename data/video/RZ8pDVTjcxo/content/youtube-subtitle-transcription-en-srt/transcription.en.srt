the cake I think

3360
01:34:58,430 --> 01:34:58,440
the cake I think
 

3361
01:34:58,440 --> 01:35:00,590
the cake I think
the cake cooled down quite a bit so I

3362
01:35:00,590 --> 01:35:00,600
the cake cooled down quite a bit so I
 

3363
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:02,870
the cake cooled down quite a bit so I
can probably make it flat it's like it's

3364
01:35:02,870 --> 01:35:02,880
can probably make it flat it's like it's
 

3365
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:07,030
can probably make it flat it's like it's
easier to stack right

3366
01:35:07,030 --> 01:35:07,040

 

3367
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:10,370
