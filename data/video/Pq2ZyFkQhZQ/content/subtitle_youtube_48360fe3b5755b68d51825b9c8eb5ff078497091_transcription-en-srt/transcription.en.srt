there is if we ever do it in 3D with a

202
00:07:19,309 --> 00:07:19,319
there is if we ever do it in 3D with a
 

203
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:22,070
there is if we ever do it in 3D with a
normal guest yeah today

204
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:22,080
normal guest yeah today
 

205
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,230
normal guest yeah today
um we will most likely I think not be

206
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:24,240
um we will most likely I think not be
 

207
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,610
um we will most likely I think not be
using this in 3D because uh um time

208
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:28,620
using this in 3D because uh um time
 

209
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,589
using this in 3D because uh um time

constraints and other reasons behind the
 

211
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:32,390

212
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:32,400
scenes don't question it but the rest
 

213
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,010
scenes don't question it but the rest
will be in 3D properly at least you've

214
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:34,020
will be in 3D properly at least you've
 

215
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,129
will be in 3D properly at least you've
seen it once here

216
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:36,139
seen it once here
 

217
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:40,070

and I can come down here and then
over here right next to the curtain

258
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:36,120
over here right next to the curtain
 

259
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,570
over here right next to the curtain
where I came through we have this

260
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:40,580

 

261
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:45,829

yay I will be maybe using this later hmm

262
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:45,839
yay I will be maybe using this later hmm
 

263
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,509
yay I will be maybe using this later hmm
maybe should I should I what do you

264
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:47,519
maybe should I should I what do you
 

265
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,389
maybe should I should I what do you
think guys should I use it

266
00:08:49,389 --> 00:08:49,399
think guys should I use it
 

267
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:52,850
think guys should I use it
yeah I think uh eventually this will

268

yeah I think uh eventually this will
 

269
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,710
yeah I think uh eventually this will
also be even more improved with like

270
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:54,720
also be even more improved with like
 

271

943
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:14,450
and I will like mirror it and then slow
it down in some parts and then just

944
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:14,460
it down in some parts and then just
 

945
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,490
it down in some parts and then just
basically watch it over and over again

946
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:16,500
basically watch it over and over again
 

947
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,630
basically watch it over and over again
slowly starting by doing really like

948
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:19,640
slowly starting by doing really like
 

949
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,770
slowly starting by doing really like
non-accurate movements in my body just

950
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:21,780
non-accurate movements in my body just
 

951
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,570
non-accurate movements in my body just
mimicking it and then eventually you

952
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:23,580
mimicking it and then eventually you
 

953
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,370
mimicking it and then eventually you
know if you repeated several times and

954
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:25,380
know if you repeated several times and
 

955
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,409
know if you repeated several times and
also try to like

956
00:24:27,409 --> 00:24:27,419
also try to like
 

957
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:29,390
also try to like
um slow it down with where there's some

958
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:29,400
um slow it down with where there's some
 

959
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,810
um slow it down with where there's some
like faster moves and so on eventually

960
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:32,820
like faster moves and so on eventually
 

961
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,390
like faster moves and so on eventually
um you just pick it up I mean I have

962
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:35,400
um you just pick it up I mean I have
 

963
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,149
um you just pick it up I mean I have
more practice with it so I think it

964
00:24:38,149 --> 00:24:38,159
more practice with it so I think it
 

965
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,649
more practice with it so I think it
might be easier for me than for some

966
00:24:39,649 --> 00:24:39,659
might be easier for me than for some
 

967
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:41,510
might be easier for me than for some
real amateurs

to really like even if you know the
 

1103
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,510
to really like even if you know the
moves yeah if you give yourself a few

1104
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:23,520
moves yeah if you give yourself a few
 

1105
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,610
moves yeah if you give yourself a few
more days of practice you will notice

1106
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:25,620
more days of practice you will notice
 

1107
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:28,610
more days of practice you will notice
that eventually it will just look so

1108
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:28,620
that eventually it will just look so
 

1109
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,970

1113
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,169
and like like you just are way better at
it if you give it up three more days

1114
00:27:39,169 --> 00:27:39,179
it if you give it up three more days
 

1115
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:42,529
it if you give it up three more days
time obviously so in total muscle memory

1116
00:27:42,529 --> 00:27:42,539
time obviously so in total muscle memory
 

1117
00:27:42,539 --> 00:27:45,049
time obviously so in total muscle memory
right yeah muscle memory as well and

1118
00:27:45,049 --> 00:27:45,059
right yeah muscle memory as well and
 

1119
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:47,210
right yeah muscle memory as well and
just feeling more confident in the moves

1120
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:47,220
just feeling more confident in the moves
 

1121
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:50,870
just feeling more confident in the moves
will just give you more like a leeway I

1122
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:50,880
will just give you more like a leeway I
 

1123
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,950
will just give you more like a leeway I
guess

1124
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:51,960
guess
 

1125
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,669
guess
um

1126
00:27:52,669 --> 00:27:52,679
um
 

1127
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:56,029
um
and then yeah it's more natural then so

1128
00:27:56,029 --> 00:27:56,039
and then yeah it's more natural then so
 

1129
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:59,269
and then yeah it's more natural then so
ideally I would give myself a week but

1182
00:28:59,390 --> 00:28:59,400
I don't really do much besides streaming
 

1183
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,730
I don't really do much besides streaming
and working so I think it's kind of like

1184
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:01,740
and working so I think it's kind of like
 

1185
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,370
and working so I think it's kind of like
a therapy to me and socializing with the

a therapy to me and socializing with the
people with the audience is like pretty

1188
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:06,960
people with the audience is like pretty
 

1189

00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:12,240
but yeah um I think that helps me to
 

1193
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,870
but yeah um I think that helps me to
stream longer and more often

1194
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:14,880
stream longer and more often
