5308
03:11:32,880 --> 03:11:34,550

um

5309
03:11:34,550 --> 03:11:34,560
um
 

5310
03:11:34,560 --> 03:11:36,150
um
worst case i could like get one that

5311
03:11:36,150 --> 03:11:36,160
worst case i could like get one that
 

5312
03:11:36,160 --> 03:11:37,910
worst case i could like get one that
doesn't shock me but actually works and

5313
03:11:37,910 --> 03:11:37,920
doesn't shock me but actually works and
 

5314
03:11:37,920 --> 03:11:39,269
doesn't shock me but actually works and
then i have a different device that

5315
03:11:39,269 --> 03:11:39,279
then i have a different device that
 

5316
03:11:39,279 --> 03:11:41,750
then i have a different device that
shocks me when i push the button so

5317
03:11:41,750 --> 03:11:41,760
shocks me when i push the button so
 

5318
03:11:41,760 --> 03:11:44,469
shocks me when i push the button so
whenever about that wait but then

5319
03:11:44,469 --> 03:11:44,479
whenever about that wait but then
 

5320
03:11:44,479 --> 03:11:46,870
whenever about that wait but then
then that wouldn't quite work that way

5321
03:11:46,870 --> 03:11:46,880
then that wouldn't quite work that way
 

5322
03:11:46,880 --> 03:11:48,469
then that wouldn't quite work that way
so i don't know i don't know if i should

5323
03:11:48,469 --> 03:11:48,479
so i don't know i don't know if i should
 

5324
03:11:48,479 --> 03:11:49,910
so i don't know i don't know if i should
buy one of those shitty ones that

5325
03:11:49,910 --> 03:11:49,920
buy one of those shitty ones that
 

5326
03:11:49,920 --> 03:11:51,990
buy one of those shitty ones that
apparently don't really work and then

5327
03:11:51,990 --> 03:11:52,000
apparently don't really work and then
 

5328
03:11:52,000 --> 03:11:54,389
apparently don't really work and then
but then but then the device will decide

5329
03:11:54,389 --> 03:11:54,399
but then but then the device will decide
 

5330
03:11:54,399 --> 03:11:57,030
but then but then the device will decide
when i lie even when i don't lie oh no
