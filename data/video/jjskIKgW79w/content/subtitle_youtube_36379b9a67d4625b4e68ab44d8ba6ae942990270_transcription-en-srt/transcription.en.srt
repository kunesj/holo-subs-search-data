513
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,870
wasn't the case but i didn't realize the
first time the first time i go in there

514
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:04,880
first time the first time i go in there
 

515
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,389
first time the first time i go in there
and i

516
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:06,399
and i
 

517
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,269
and i
went

518
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:07,279

like a different path than the one that

520
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:09,440
like a different path than the one that
 

521
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,509
like a different path than the one that
tells you you get a follower

522
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:11,519
tells you you get a follower
 

523
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,189

because i thought that's just you know a
 

525
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,710
because i thought that's just you know a
random follower not the quest follower

00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:16,720
random follower not the quest follower
 

527

so i went a different path and then
 

529
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,870
so i went a different path and then
after looking at the path later on i

530
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:20,880
after looking at the path later on i

but it pissed me off so much and it was
so difficult for me and you have to

596
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:34,480
so difficult for me and you have to
 

597
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,870
so difficult for me and you have to
consider it was also oopsy it was also

598
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:38,880

ah
crap

614
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:55,759

 

615
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,910

uh so i had quite some trouble with that

616
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:57,920
uh so i had quite some trouble with that
 

617
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,629
uh so i had quite some trouble with that
why do i do that

618
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:00,639
why do i do that
 

619
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,110
why do i do that
and then i died and then i raised then i

620
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:03,120
and then i died and then i raised then i
 

621
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,949
and then i died and then i raised then i
sacrificed someone but then i died again

622
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:04,959
sacrificed someone but then i died again
 

623
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,990
sacrificed someone but then i died again
pretty immediately

00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:08,000

 

625
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,110

so

626
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:09,120
so
 

627
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,949
so
turns out you can't sacrifice two times

628
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:10,959
turns out you can't sacrifice two times
 

629
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,990
turns out you can't sacrifice two times
in one dungeon

630
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:14,000

5339
02:05:14,800 --> 02:05:16,149
i feel like they should have known but
maybe that's just their

5340
02:05:16,149 --> 02:05:16,159
maybe that's just their
 

5341
02:05:16,159 --> 02:05:18,470
maybe that's just their
their basic setup and they just didn't

5342
02:05:18,470 --> 02:05:18,480
their basic setup and they just didn't
 

5343
02:05:18,480 --> 02:05:20,230
their basic setup and they just didn't
want to prepare anymore

5344
02:05:20,230 --> 02:05:20,240
want to prepare anymore
 

5345
02:05:20,240 --> 02:05:22,069

[Laughter]
 

5347
02:05:22,079 --> 02:05:24,229
[Laughter]
for some reason

5348
02:05:24,229 --> 02:05:24,239
for some reason
 

5349
02:05:24,239 --> 02:05:26,470
for some reason
but i feel like it was basically seats

5350
02:05:26,470 --> 02:05:26,480
but i feel like it was basically seats
 

5351
02:05:26,480 --> 02:05:29,030
but i feel like it was basically seats
for like 20 people or so

5352
02:05:29,030 --> 02:05:29,040
for like 20 people or so
 

5353
02:05:29,040 --> 02:05:31,910
for like 20 people or so
okay maybe a bit more maybe 50 50. and

5354
02:05:31,910 --> 02:05:31,920
okay maybe a bit more maybe 50 50. and
 

5355
02:05:31,920 --> 02:05:34,629
okay maybe a bit more maybe 50 50. and
then around that was like

5356
02:05:34,629 --> 02:05:34,639
then around that was like
 

5357
02:05:34,639 --> 02:05:36,870
then around that was like
hundreds of people standing behind like

5358
02:05:36,870 --> 02:05:36,880
hundreds of people standing behind like
 

5359
02:05:36,880 --> 02:05:39,669
hundreds of people standing behind like
a fence

5360
02:05:39,669 --> 02:05:39,679

 

5361
02:05:39,679 --> 02:05:41,589

which was kind of weird because there

5362
02:05:41,589 --> 02:05:41,599
which was kind of weird because there
 

5363
02:05:41,599 --> 02:05:43,750
which was kind of weird because there
was really so much space in between the

5364
02:05:43,750 --> 02:05:43,760
was really so much space in between the
 

5365

7683
03:00:40,479 --> 03:00:42,230
basically so it's not really in my hands
when i can do it

7684
03:00:42,230 --> 03:00:42,240
when i can do it
 

7685
03:00:42,240 --> 03:00:44,550
when i can do it
and i'll have to

7686
03:00:44,550 --> 03:00:44,560
and i'll have to
 

7687
03:00:44,560 --> 03:00:47,429
and i'll have to
adjust and um ah

7688
03:00:47,429 --> 03:00:47,439
adjust and um ah
 

7689
03:00:47,439 --> 03:00:50,870

03:00:57,670 --> 03:00:57,680
um so i kind of doubt that it will work
 

7697
03:00:57,680 --> 03:00:58,630
um so i kind of doubt that it will work

craving toll cuts recently

14186
05:44:24,788 --> 05:44:24,798

 

14187
05:44:24,798 --> 05:45:07,430

how

14188
05:45:07,430 --> 05:45:07,440

 

14189
05:45:07,440 --> 05:45:08,788

and and

14190
05:45:08,788 --> 05:45:08,798
and and
 

14191
05:45:08,798 --> 05:45:10,788
and and
let me have it i think

14192
05:45:10,788 --> 05:45:10,798
let me have it i think
 

14193
05:45:10,798 --> 05:45:12,390
let me have it i think
you know even if the train ride is like

14194
05:45:12,390 --> 05:45:12,400
you know even if the train ride is like
 

14195
05:45:12,400 --> 05:45:14,628
you know even if the train ride is like
10 hours or so

14196
05:45:14,628 --> 05:45:14,638
10 hours or so
 

14197
05:45:14,638 --> 05:45:17,430
10 hours or so
i think it could be fine if she gives it

14198
05:45:17,430 --> 05:45:17,440
i think it could be fine if she gives it
 

14199
05:45:17,440 --> 05:45:20,150
i think it could be fine if she gives it
to me directly

14200
05:45:20,150 --> 05:45:20,160
to me directly
 

14201
05:45:20,160 --> 05:45:22,628

the tonkatsu place again

14204
05:45:29,590 --> 05:45:29,600

 

14205
05:45:29,600 --> 05:45:31,590

maybe like i don't know

14206
05:45:31,590 --> 05:45:31,600
maybe like i don't know
 

14207
05:45:31,600 --> 05:45:33,670
maybe like i don't know
maybe in october

14208
05:45:33,670 --> 05:45:33,680
maybe in october
 

14209
05:45:33,680 --> 05:45:35,270
maybe in october
or september i mean it could really just

14210
05:45:35,270 --> 05:45:35,280
or september i mean it could really just
 

14211
05:45:35,280 --> 05:45:38,310
or september i mean it could really just
be a one night trip really

14212
05:45:38,310 --> 05:45:38,320
be a one night trip really
 

14213
05:45:38,320 --> 05:45:39,990
be a one night trip really
isn't that a waste just because i really

14214
05:45:39,990 --> 05:45:40,000
isn't that a waste just because i really
 

14215
05:45:40,000 --> 05:45:42,150
