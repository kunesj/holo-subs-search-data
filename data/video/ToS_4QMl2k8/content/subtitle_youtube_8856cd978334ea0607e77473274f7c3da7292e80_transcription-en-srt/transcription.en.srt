00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:39,960
I think the one thing that is like

generally you would think that painting

1988
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:41,700
generally you would think that painting
 

1989
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:45,349
generally you would think that painting
in Sims is an easy way to make money but

1990
00:45:45,349 --> 00:45:45,359
in Sims is an easy way to make money but
 

1991
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:47,270
in Sims is an easy way to make money but
the problem is I think even with a bad

1992
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:47,280
the problem is I think even with a bad
 

1993
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,490
the problem is I think even with a bad
mood you can go to work

1994
00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:49,500
mood you can go to work
 

1995
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,829
mood you can go to work
but with a bad mood you can't paint but

1996
00:45:51,829 --> 00:45:51,839
but with a bad mood you can't paint but
 

1997
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:53,089
but with a bad mood you can't paint but
if you have a normal job you can still

1998
00:45:53,089 --> 00:45:53,099
if you have a normal job you can still
 

1999
00:45:53,099 --> 00:45:54,530
if you have a normal job you can still
go to work with a bad mood that's what

2000
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:54,540
go to work with a bad mood that's what
 

2001
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:59,589
go to work with a bad mood that's what
I'm saying um

2002
00:45:59,589 --> 00:45:59,599

 

2003
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:02,450

so a normal job would kind of be better

2004
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:02,460
so a normal job would kind of be better
 

2005
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,370
so a normal job would kind of be better
but she would come back

2006
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:04,380
but she would come back
 

2007
