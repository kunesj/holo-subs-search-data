lo-fi remixes

192
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:21,919
lo-fi remixes
 

193
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,510
lo-fi remixes

195
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,469
the melody
and the verses and all that are not

196
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:26,479

200
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:30,479
uh they're they're pretty much the same
 

201
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:31,589
uh they're they're pretty much the same
just

202
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:31,599
just
 

203
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,350
just
a slow one

204
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:33,360
a slow one
 

205
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,670
a slow one
um but with the bossa nova

206
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:35,680
um but with the bossa nova
 

207
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,310
um but with the bossa nova
versions this is why i was so confused

208
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:38,320
versions this is why i was so confused
 

209
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,790
versions this is why i was so confused
when i first started jamming out to them

210
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:40,800
when i first started jamming out to them
 

211
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,550
when i first started jamming out to them
in the bosa nova versions there's

212
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:42,560
in the bosa nova versions there's
 

213
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,670
in the bosa nova versions there's
actually

214
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:43,680
actually
 

215
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,990
actually
um they took out usually the second

216
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:46,000
um they took out usually the second
 

217
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,710
um they took out usually the second
verse like after the first chorus they

218
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:48,720
verse like after the first chorus they
 

219
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,790
verse like after the first chorus they
would like get rid of the second verse

220
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:50,800
would like get rid of the second verse
 

221
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,670
would like get rid of the second verse
and then

222
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:51,680
and then
 

223
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,030
and then
replace it with an instrumental solo

224
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,040
replace it with an instrumental solo
 

225
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,110
replace it with an instrumental solo
that's why i got so confused so before

226
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:57,120
that's why i got so confused so before
 

227
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,269
that's why i got so confused so before
the stream i was trying to like i was

228
00:08:59,269 --> 00:08:59,279
the stream i was trying to like i was
 

229
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,710
the stream i was trying to like i was
choosing the songs and trying to figure

230
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:00,720
choosing the songs and trying to figure
 

231
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,990
choosing the songs and trying to figure
out which parts got uh rid of and then

232
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,000
out which parts got uh rid of and then
 

233
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,509
out which parts got uh rid of and then
where it would start

234
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:05,519
where it would start
 

235
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,030
where it would start
again to sing

236
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:07,040
again to sing
 

237
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,550
again to sing

so
 

2209
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:38,709
so
in theory i also

2210
01:41:38,709 --> 01:41:38,719
in theory i also
 

2211
01:41:38,719 --> 01:41:40,790
in theory i also
can't do it from scratch but this made

2212
01:41:40,790 --> 01:41:40,800
can't do it from scratch but this made

but i'm actually not sure what's planned
 

3623
02:14:24,800 --> 02:14:26,950
but i'm actually not sure what's planned
if we should all have it at one point of

02:14:26,950 --> 02:14:26,960
if we should all have it at one point of
 

3625
02:14:26,960 --> 02:14:29,270
if we should all have it at one point of

3626
02:14:29,270 --> 02:14:29,280

3627
02:14:29,280 --> 02:14:30,229
view what do you guys think
because

3628
02:14:30,229 --> 02:14:30,239
because
 

3629
02:14:30,239 --> 02:14:32,149
because
in the end even if there's only one

3630
02:14:32,149 --> 02:14:32,159
in the end even if there's only one
 

3631
02:14:32,159 --> 02:14:34,069
in the end even if there's only one
point of view you see

3632
02:14:34,069 --> 02:14:34,079
point of view you see
 

3633
02:14:34,079 --> 02:14:36,069
point of view you see
what everyone's drawing

3634
02:14:36,069 --> 02:14:36,079
what everyone's drawing
 

3635
02:14:36,079 --> 02:14:38,149
what everyone's drawing
afterwards anyway but i guess it's yeah

3636
02:14:38,149 --> 02:14:38,159
afterwards anyway but i guess it's yeah
 

3637
02:14:38,159 --> 02:14:40,470
afterwards anyway but i guess it's yeah
you can see the thought behind it

3638
02:14:40,470 --> 02:14:40,480
you can see the thought behind it
 

3639
02:14:40,480 --> 02:14:42,950
you can see the thought behind it
and yeah i guess

3640
02:14:42,950 --> 02:14:42,960
and yeah i guess
 

3641
02:14:42,960 --> 02:14:44,950
and yeah i guess
everyone's point of view would make

3642
02:14:44,950 --> 02:14:44,960
everyone's point of view would make
 

3643
02:14:44,960 --> 02:14:52,149
everyone's point of view would make
sense too

yeah i think it would be fine too

3648
02:14:59,430 --> 02:14:59,440
yeah i think it would be fine too
 

3649
02:14:59,440 --> 02:15:03,510
yeah i think it would be fine too
