that
 

1922

that
electrical room was dark, so I

1923
01:44:21,950 --> 01:44:21,960
electrical room was dark, so I
 

1924
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:24,169
electrical room was dark, so I
went there to fix it, and Sui-chan

1925
01:44:24,169 --> 01:44:24,179
went there to fix it, and Sui-chan
 

1926
01:44:24,179 --> 01:44:26,270
went there to fix it, and Sui-chan
told me that I knew exactly what it was,

01:44:26,270 --> 01:44:26,280
told me that I knew exactly what it was,

1930
01:44:29,219 --> 01:44:32,030
and then I was about to leave.  I
was behind Sui-chan, so if that's the case, there would

1931
01:44:32,030 --> 01:44:32,040
was behind Sui-chan, so if that's the case, there would
 

1932
01:44:32,040 --> 01:44:36,709
was behind Sui-chan, so if that's the case, there would
be a dead body, and I'd definitely be suspicious.I

1933
01:44:36,709 --> 01:44:37,550

1935
01:44:37,560 --> 01:44:47,350

01:44:47,350 --> 01:44:47,360

 

1937
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:52,729

1939
01:44:52,739 --> 01:44:55,669

about to fall.  You really

1940
01:44:55,669 --> 01:44:55,679
about to fall.  You really
 

1941
01:44:55,679 --> 01:44:57,649
about to fall.  You really
think he's dead,

1942
01:44:57,649 --> 01:44:57,659
think he's dead,
 

1943
01:44:57,659 --> 01:45:01,490

1949
01:45:09,440 --> 01:45:16,129

1950
01:45:16,129 --> 01:45:16,139

Noel went to the security side.  Nede me

01:45:21,290 --> 01:45:21,300
I
 

1955
01:45:21,300 --> 01:45:24,470
I
went to the right side from Electrical, but at that time, it flopped and

1956
01:45:24,470 --> 01:45:24,480
went to the right side from Electrical, but at that time, it flopped and
 

1957
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:26,629
went to the right side from Electrical, but at that time, it flopped and
fell down, so it's

1958
01:45:26,629 --> 01:45:27,890
fell down, so it's

There are a few ways to say things like this, but I

2517
02:08:22,729 --> 02:08:22,739
There are a few ways to say things like this, but I
 

2518
02:08:22,739 --> 02:08:28,790
There are a few ways to say things like this, but I
personally really like it when I say "Ora-ora" to my seniors.

2519
02:08:28,790 --> 02:08:30,270

Please let me say "Ora-ora" again.

2525
02:08:49,129 --> 02:08:49,139

and we were

2531
02:08:53,510 --> 02:08:53,520

2532
02:08:53,520 --> 02:08:55,669
and we were
able to make a poster together, and we

2533
02:08:55,669 --> 02:08:55,679

got a double kill. Thank you. Let's

2535
02:09:03,530 --> 02:09:03,540

2546
02:09:21,719 --> 02:09:26,470

Since I can communicate with Hanesui-chan, I

2547
02:09:26,470 --> 02:09:26,480

 

2548
02:09:26,480 --> 02:09:28,149

2553
02:09:34,199 --> 02:09:43,669

for a moment, but it's the number one thing you can watch
as much as you like. Even though I can't speak English and I'm a little bad at it,
