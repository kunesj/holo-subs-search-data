I was just like reading things and when

3448
01:47:33,410 --> 01:47:33,420
I was just like reading things and when
 

3449
01:47:33,420 --> 01:47:37,070
I was just like reading things and when
I couldn't read something like a kanji

3450
01:47:37,070 --> 01:47:37,080
I couldn't read something like a kanji
 

3451
01:47:37,080 --> 01:47:39,649
I couldn't read something like a kanji
I would just copy paste it

3452
01:47:39,649 --> 01:47:39,659
I would just copy paste it
 

3453
01:47:39,659 --> 01:47:42,290
I would just copy paste it
because I was too lazy to learn like

3454
01:47:42,290 --> 01:47:42,300
because I was too lazy to learn like
 

3455
01:47:42,300 --> 01:47:44,990
because I was too lazy to learn like
purposefully

3456
01:47:44,990 --> 01:47:45,000
purposefully
 

3457
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,450
purposefully
so I just like copy paste

3458
01:47:47,450 --> 01:47:47,460
so I just like copy paste
 

3459
01:47:47,460 --> 01:47:49,250
so I just like copy paste
what I couldn't read

3460
01:47:49,250 --> 01:47:49,260
what I couldn't read
 

3461
01:47:49,260 --> 01:47:51,410
what I couldn't read
put it into

3462
01:47:51,410 --> 01:47:51,420
put it into
 

3463
01:47:51,420 --> 01:47:56,510
put it into
like a room odomaji fire

3464
01:47:56,510 --> 01:47:56,520

 

3465
01:47:56,520 --> 01:47:57,590

um

3466
01:47:57,590 --> 01:47:57,600
um
 

3467
01:47:57,600 --> 01:47:59,689
um
and then pretended that I already knew

3468
01:47:59,689 --> 01:47:59,699
and then pretended that I already knew
 

3469
01:47:59,699 --> 01:48:04,609
and then pretended that I already knew
it

3470
01:48:04,609 --> 01:48:04,619

 

3471
01:48:04,619 --> 01:48:13,990

so really not a good example

3472
01:48:13,990 --> 01:48:14,000

 

3473
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:17,149

3477
01:48:21,440 --> 01:48:24,890

but you know maybe I could compare it to

3478
01:48:24,890 --> 01:48:24,900
but you know maybe I could compare it to
 

3479
01:48:24,900 --> 01:48:33,850
but you know maybe I could compare it to
me learning uh hunger Korean signs

3480
01:48:33,850 --> 01:48:33,860

 

3481
01:48:33,860 --> 01:48:36,169

is that worth it is that worth the

is that worth it is that worth the
 

3483
01:48:36,179 --> 01:48:43,129

5045

but I think it's based uh you know I
said it's based on a novel no Nobel

02:43:29,510 --> 02:43:29,520
lenient about it I can basically decide
 

5199
02:43:29,520 --> 02:43:33,469
lenient about it I can basically decide
for myself if I I think that I

5200
02:43:33,469 --> 02:43:33,479
for myself if I I think that I
 

5201
02:43:33,479 --> 02:43:37,670

02:43:44,100 --> 02:43:45,770
funny thing is when they were explaining
um when we were rehearsing and they were

5210

can decide it on your own and for
 

5219
02:43:56,399 --> 02:43:57,889
can decide it on your own and for
example when it says barbecue if there's

5220
02:43:57,889 --> 02:43:57,899
example when it says barbecue if there's
 

5221
02:43:57,899 --> 02:43:59,630
example when it says barbecue if there's
a game that you play where you play

that if we complete it apparently we're

5246
02:44:27,830 --> 02:44:27,840
that if we complete it apparently we're
 

5247
02:44:27,840 --> 02:44:29,570
that if we complete it apparently we're
gonna get a reward that has not been

5248
02:44:29,570 --> 02:44:29,580
gonna get a reward that has not been
 

5249
02:44:29,580 --> 02:44:36,170
gonna get a reward that has not been
decided yet

5250
02:44:36,170 --> 02:44:36,180

 

5251
02:44:36,180 --> 02:44:37,610

yeah

5252
02:44:37,610 --> 02:44:37,620
yeah
 

5253
02:44:37,620 --> 02:44:40,490
yeah
it hasn't been decided yet

5254
02:44:40,490 --> 02:44:40,500
it hasn't been decided yet
 

5255
02:44:40,500 --> 02:44:43,190
it hasn't been decided yet
apparently

5256
02:44:43,190 --> 02:44:43,200
apparently
 

5257
02:44:43,200 --> 02:44:48,250
apparently
but it'll be something nice they said

5258
02:44:48,250 --> 02:44:48,260

 

5259
02:44:48,260 --> 02:44:51,710

that's what they said

5260
02:44:51,710 --> 02:44:51,720

 

5261
02:44:51,720 --> 02:44:54,110

so that's that's not motivating isn't it

5262
02:44:54,110 --> 02:44:54,120
so that's that's not motivating isn't it
 

5263
02:44:54,120 --> 02:44:55,910
so that's that's not motivating isn't it
apparently there will be something I

5264
02:44:55,910 --> 02:44:55,920
apparently there will be something I
 

5265
02:44:55,920 --> 02:44:58,429
apparently there will be something I
don't know what

5266
02:44:58,429 --> 02:44:58,439
don't know what
 

5267
02:44:58,439 --> 02:45:00,349
don't know what
General it's also just fun I guess to do

5268
02:45:00,349 --> 02:45:00,359
General it's also just fun I guess to do
 

5269
02:45:00,359 --> 02:45:03,590
General it's also just fun I guess to do
it even if there wasn't a reward and

5270
02:45:03,590 --> 02:45:03,600
it even if there wasn't a reward and
 

5271
02:45:03,600 --> 02:45:06,530
it even if there wasn't a reward and

you know

12054
06:34:33,410 --> 06:34:33,420

 

12055
06:34:33,420 --> 06:34:36,650

if I see it very objectively maybe I

12056
06:34:36,650 --> 06:34:36,660
if I see it very objectively maybe I
 

12057
06:34:36,660 --> 06:34:39,048
if I see it very objectively maybe I
would give it a 9 out of 10.

12058
06:34:39,048 --> 06:34:39,058
would give it a 9 out of 10.
 

12059
06:34:39,058 --> 06:34:41,810
would give it a 9 out of 10.
but I want to give it a 10 out of 10.

12060
06:34:41,810 --> 06:34:41,820
but I want to give it a 10 out of 10.
 

12061
06:34:41,820 --> 06:34:45,530
but I want to give it a 10 out of 10.
um

12062
06:34:45,530 --> 06:34:45,540

 

12063
06:34:45,540 --> 06:34:47,448

yeah

12064
06:34:47,448 --> 06:34:47,458
yeah
 

12065
06:34:47,458 --> 06:34:49,548
yeah
the highs there's highs and lows and

12066
06:34:49,548 --> 06:34:49,558
the highs there's highs and lows and
 

12067
06:34:49,558 --> 06:34:51,410
the highs there's highs and lows and
mids but the highs are so high that it

12068
06:34:51,410 --> 06:34:51,420
mids but the highs are so high that it
 

12069
06:34:51,420 --> 06:34:59,030
mids but the highs are so high that it
makes up for the lows you know

12070
06:34:59,030 --> 06:34:59,040

 

12071
06:34:59,040 --> 06:35:00,590

so

12072
06:35:00,590 --> 06:35:00,600
so
 

12073
06:35:00,600 --> 06:35:03,708
so
that's that we finished another game and

12074
06:35:03,708 --> 06:35:03,718
that's that we finished another game and
 

12075
06:35:03,718 --> 06:35:06,770
that's that we finished another game and
I will maybe maybe it's good that we

12076
06:35:06,770 --> 06:35:06,780
I will maybe maybe it's good that we
 

12077
06:35:06,780 --> 06:35:08,628
I will maybe maybe it's good that we
didn't do everything on stream like for

12078
06:35:08,628 --> 06:35:08,638
didn't do everything on stream like for
 

12079
06:35:08,638 --> 06:35:10,730
didn't do everything on stream like for
overall for the whole playthrough I've

12080
06:35:10,730 --> 06:35:10,740
overall for the whole playthrough I've
 

12081
06:35:10,740 --> 06:35:12,230
overall for the whole playthrough I've
been doing a lot of things offstream but

12082
06:35:12,230 --> 06:35:12,240
been doing a lot of things offstream but
 

12083
06:35:12,240 --> 06:35:13,610
been doing a lot of things offstream but
maybe it's good that we didn't drag it

12084
06:35:13,610 --> 06:35:13,620
maybe it's good that we didn't drag it
 

12085
06:35:13,620 --> 06:35:15,230
maybe it's good that we didn't drag it
out much longer because this gives me

12086
06:35:15,230 --> 06:35:15,240
out much longer because this gives me
 

12087
06:35:15,240 --> 06:35:19,368
out much longer because this gives me
some more fun time with Zelda uh tears

12088
