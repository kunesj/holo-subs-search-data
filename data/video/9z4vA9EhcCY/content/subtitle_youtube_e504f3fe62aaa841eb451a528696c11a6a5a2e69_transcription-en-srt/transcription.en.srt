00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:07,730

yeah I'm really curious to see how these

1858
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:07,740
yeah I'm really curious to see how these
 

1859
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:09,530
yeah I'm really curious to see how these
aggressive teams play against each other

1860
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:09,540
aggressive teams play against each other
 

1861
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:12,470
aggressive teams play against each other
so for us to get first place if it were

1862
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:12,480
so for us to get first place if it were
 

1863
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:13,730
so for us to get first place if it were
to happen

1864
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:13,740
to happen
 

1865
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:15,530
to happen
um then

1866
00:57:15,530 --> 00:57:15,540
um then
 

1867
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:19,250
um then
what wait wait so if JP wins then we def

1868
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:19,260
what wait wait so if JP wins then we def
 

1869
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:20,750
what wait wait so if JP wins then we def
then JP definitely gets first place

1870
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:20,760
then JP definitely gets first place
 

1871
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:24,349
then JP definitely gets first place
right I think so if ID wins then there

1872
00:57:24,349 --> 00:57:24,359
right I think so if ID wins then there
 

1873
00:57:24,359 --> 00:57:25,670
right I think so if ID wins then there
might be a chance depending on point

1874
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:25,680
might be a chance depending on point
 

1875
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:28,250
might be a chance depending on point
difference and they could get like 800

1876
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:28,260
difference and they could get like 800
 

1877
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:31,430
difference and they could get like 800
points yeah I don't know it could be a

1878
00:57:31,430 --> 00:57:31,440
points yeah I don't know it could be a
 

1879
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:36,690
