every freaking day so she'd probably be
 

13657
06:35:09,900 --> 06:35:11,628
every freaking day so she'd probably be
busy and have some days where she isn't

06:35:11,628 --> 06:35:11,638
busy and have some days where she isn't

around for half a year or so
 

15899
07:30:46,400 --> 07:30:50,270
around for half a year or so
so if the guarantee is one year then

could have been stressed on the board
 

15989
07:32:39,600 --> 07:32:43,368
could have been stressed on the board
itself yeah but I think not on what was

15990
07:32:43,368 --> 07:32:43,378
itself yeah but I think not on what was
 

15991
07:32:43,378 --> 07:32:46,910
itself yeah but I think not on what was
on top but how the possibly how the feet

15992
07:32:46,910 --> 07:32:46,920
on top but how the possibly how the feet
 

15993
07:32:46,920 --> 07:32:48,948
on top but how the possibly how the feet
were assembled because obviously there

15994
07:32:48,948 --> 07:32:48,958
were assembled because obviously there
 

15995
07:32:48,958 --> 07:32:51,230
were assembled because obviously there
was something wrong but we tried

15996
07:32:51,230 --> 07:32:51,240
was something wrong but we tried
 

15997
07:32:51,240 --> 07:32:54,048
was something wrong but we tried
assembling them million times

15998
07:32:54,048 --> 07:32:54,058
assembling them million times
 

15999
07:32:54,058 --> 07:32:56,448
assembling them million times
and never got it right apparently but

16000
07:32:56,448 --> 07:32:56,458
and never got it right apparently but
 

16001
07:32:56,458 --> 07:32:57,890
and never got it right apparently but
like apparently there was something

16002
07:32:57,890 --> 07:32:57,900
like apparently there was something
 

16003
07:32:57,900 --> 07:32:59,150
like apparently there was something
wrong of it

16004
07:32:59,150 --> 07:32:59,160
wrong of it
 

16005
07:32:59,160 --> 07:33:01,490
wrong of it
and that might have um been the reason

16006
07:33:01,490 --> 07:33:01,500
and that might have um been the reason
 

16007
07:33:01,500 --> 07:33:03,770
and that might have um been the reason
why after a long time

16008
