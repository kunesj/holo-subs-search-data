[Music]

3400
01:30:16,310 --> 01:30:16,320

 

3401
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:18,390

but it was so good because it was like

3402
01:30:18,390 --> 01:30:18,400
but it was so good because it was like
 

3403
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:22,310
but it was so good because it was like
um like a soupy a soupy curry it was so

3404
01:30:22,310 --> 01:30:22,320
um like a soupy a soupy curry it was so
 

3405
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:25,270
um like a soupy a soupy curry it was so
hot and warm and and really spicy

3406
01:30:25,270 --> 01:30:25,280
hot and warm and and really spicy
 

3407
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:27,830
hot and warm and and really spicy
actually so both of our noses were

3408
01:30:27,830 --> 01:30:27,840
actually so both of our noses were
 

3409
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:32,470
actually so both of our noses were
running and running and running

3410
01:30:32,470 --> 01:30:32,480

 

3411
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:38,629

now the kickoff

3412
01:30:38,629 --> 01:30:38,639

 

3413
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:40,709

and and actually we were both really

3414
01:30:40,709 --> 01:30:40,719
and and actually we were both really
 

3415
01:30:40,719 --> 01:30:43,189
and and actually we were both really
slow at eating because we don't

3416
01:30:43,189 --> 01:30:43,199
slow at eating because we don't
 

3417
01:30:43,199 --> 01:30:45,910
slow at eating because we don't
slurp the food so the noodles ended up

3418
01:30:45,910 --> 01:30:45,920
slurp the food so the noodles ended up
 

3419
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:48,950
slurp the food so the noodles ended up
being pretty soggy at some point

3420
01:30:48,950 --> 01:30:48,960
being pretty soggy at some point
 

3421
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:50,310
being pretty soggy at some point
so

3422
01:30:50,310 --> 01:30:50,320
so
 

3423
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:52,390

it is true you should eat your noodles

3424
01:30:52,390 --> 01:30:52,400

like let's say
 

9483
04:20:43,040 --> 04:20:45,750
like let's say
i do one song and

9484
04:20:45,750 --> 04:20:45,760
i do one song and
 

9485
04:20:45,760 --> 04:20:47,030
i do one song and
um

9486
04:20:47,030 --> 04:20:47,040

i feel like i when i sing i have a

9488
04:20:48,790 --> 04:20:48,800
i feel like i when i sing i have a
 

9489
04:20:48,800 --> 04:20:51,510
i feel like i when i sing i have a
better control over it than when i talk

9490
04:20:51,510 --> 04:20:51,520
better control over it than when i talk

like over breathing because

9492
04:20:55,510 --> 04:20:55,520
like over breathing because
 

9493
04:20:55,520 --> 04:20:56,790
like over breathing because
um

9494
04:20:56,790 --> 04:20:56,800
um
 

9495
04:20:56,800 --> 04:20:58,550
um
i think it's because when you learn a

9496
04:20:58,550 --> 04:20:58,560
i think it's because when you learn a
 

9497
04:20:58,560 --> 04:21:01,110
i think it's because when you learn a
song or when you record a song and so on

9498
04:21:01,110 --> 04:21:01,120
song or when you record a song and so on
 

9499
04:21:01,120 --> 04:21:02,070
song or when you record a song and so on
you

9500
04:21:02,070 --> 04:21:02,080
you
 

9501
04:21:02,080 --> 04:21:04,630
you
figure out where to breathe

9502
04:21:04,630 --> 04:21:04,640
figure out where to breathe
 

9503
04:21:04,640 --> 04:21:06,630
figure out where to breathe
so your breathing is really controlled

9504
04:21:06,630 --> 04:21:06,640
