5928
02:36:11,990 --> 02:36:12,000
have a stick and then I'm putting M on
 

5929
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,990
have a stick and then I'm putting M on
the stick and it's at 80% and then I

5930
02:36:14,990 --> 02:36:15,000
the stick and it's at 80% and then I
 

5931
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:16,830
the stick and it's at 80% and then I
have to put it on the other data machine

5932
02:36:16,830 --> 02:36:16,840
have to put it on the other data machine
 

5933
02:36:16,840 --> 02:36:19,590
have to put it on the other data machine
and then uh this is really a tomaton

5934
02:36:19,590 --> 02:36:19,600
and then uh this is really a tomaton
 

5935
02:36:19,600 --> 02:36:22,349
and then uh this is really a tomaton
technology right here yeah this thing is

02:36:22,349 --> 02:36:22,359
technology right here yeah this thing is
 

5937
02:36:22,359 --> 02:36:24,349
technology right here yeah this thing is
like when I was created they wanted like

5938
02:36:24,349 --> 02:36:24,359
like when I was created they wanted like
 

5939
02:36:24,359 --> 02:36:27,670
like when I was created they wanted like
it to be really secure you know so they

5940
02:36:27,670 --> 02:36:27,680
it to be really secure you know so they
 

5941
02:36:27,680 --> 02:36:29,990
it to be really secure you know so they
they didn't let any like my brain is

5942

complicated imimi and Engineering very
 

5947
02:36:35,880 --> 02:36:39,269
complicated imimi and Engineering very
complicated lots of gears and cogs

5948
02:36:39,269 --> 02:36:39,279
complicated lots of gears and cogs
 

5949
02:36:39,279 --> 02:36:40,710
