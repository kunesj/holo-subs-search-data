actually study

130
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:17,360
actually study
 

131
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,309
actually study
and um investigate what the people there

132
00:08:20,309 --> 00:08:20,319
and um investigate what the people there
 

133

actually eat and what sells well and so
 

135
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,189
actually eat and what sells well and so
so i think in general the thing probably

136
00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:25,199
so i think in general the thing probably
 

137
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,110
so i think in general the thing probably
is that if you if they send you a

138
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:27,120
is that if you if they send you a
 

139
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,029
is that if you if they send you a
european snack box then it's probably

140
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:29,039
european snack box then it's probably
 

141
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,350
european snack box then it's probably
gonna be a good one but if it's outside

142
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:31,360
gonna be a good one but if it's outside
 

143
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,509
gonna be a good one but if it's outside
of europe then

144
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:33,519
of europe then
 

145
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,990
of europe then
good luck
