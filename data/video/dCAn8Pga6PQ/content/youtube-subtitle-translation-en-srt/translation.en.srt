474
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:08,110

 

475
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:12,270

effect of the light scales in the village is a little more realistic.  It

476
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:12,280
effect of the light scales in the village is a little more realistic.  It
 

477
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:17,010
effect of the light scales in the village is a little more realistic.  It
also incorporates a realistic style, so it's a very hybrid expression.

478
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:17,020
also incorporates a realistic style, so it's a very hybrid expression.
 

479
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,090
also incorporates a realistic style, so it's a very hybrid expression.
This time, I'm

480
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:18,100
This time, I'm
 

481
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:22,520
This time, I'm
challenging myself with that, and I'm calling it Sociedad,

482
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:22,530
challenging myself with that, and I'm calling it Sociedad,
 

483
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:24,130
challenging myself with that, and I'm calling it Sociedad,
but I think

484
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:24,140
but I think
 

485
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:29,620
but I think
it's good for Tales of, and the loop that puts the superior on is also up.

486
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:34,150
it's good for Tales of, and the loop that puts the superior on is also up.
 

487
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:34,160

 

488

489
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:35,130

 

490
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:38,050

There are many people who have hobbies like that, and we have received a lot of responses, so

491
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:38,060
There are many people who have hobbies like that, and we have received a lot of responses, so
 

492
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:43,890
There are many people who have hobbies like that, and we have received a lot of responses, so
this Arais is, of course, an extension of that.

00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:44,770
this Arais is, of course, an extension of that.

After all, it

decided to
 

504
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:04,310
decided to
push the boundaries.  But I

505
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:04,320
push the boundaries.  But I
 

506
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:10,400
push the boundaries.  But I
also had a strong desire to update the Rails of style a bit, to make it different from other works.  Well,

513
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:37,529

I had some regrets as I was discussing with the development art team and the art director about whether we could express it in a new way. It's not a pushy cel look, it's a little watercolor-like. It's an

522
00:21:51,409 --> 00:21:57,640

think that it's possible to express something that is new and different from what I've been doing, and I've been trying out various things to realize that, and as a result, I

00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:10,180

So, it took about four years of development to complete the project, or rather to triple its size, and I got to

Of course, it didn't take that long, but even during that long development period, we

kept evolving and we
 

537
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:31,990
kept evolving and we
got to a point where the station could see it as a product, which is what we're expressing today.  I

543
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:41,900

wonder what kind of impression everyone had. I see that everyone has responded positively to the new expression,

thank you. I

but in the end, it didn't feel strange at all and I thought it was very beautiful.  I

Then, how is the sound of Rise different from other games?

Also, were there any new additions?

00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:58,980
taken another look at what makes the game so Tales of unique,
and we've carefully considered what we want to change and evolve based on that.

and we've carefully considered what we want to change and evolve based on that.

That's the
 

582
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:06,310
That's the
approach we're taking in development.  There are some small differences,

583
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:06,320
approach we're taking in development.  There are some small differences,
 

584
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:13,000
approach we're taking in development.  There are some small differences,
but I think you'll understand, but the feeling you get and what you

but I think you'll understand, but the feeling you get and what you
 

586
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:18,630
but I think you'll understand, but the feeling you get and what you
feel are definitely the same as what the Tales of series

587
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:18,640
feel are definitely the same as what the Tales of series
 

588
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,330
feel are definitely the same as what the Tales of series
has offered to you up until now.

592
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:29,680

In order to get people to like it and get them interested in it, the

593
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:29,690
In order to get people to like it and get them interested in it, the
 

594
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:32,310
In order to get people to like it and get them interested in it, the
changes to the appearance and the

changes to the appearance and the
 

596
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:37,130
changes to the appearance and the
tuning of the game design of the 8th specification were

00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:37,140
tuning of the game design of the 8th specification were
 

598
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:42,110
tuning of the game design of the 8th specification were
done after a few radical modifications.

599
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:44,700
done after a few radical modifications.
 

600
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:44,710

 

601
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:49,720

But this time, it's difficult to go that far, but

602
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:49,730
But this time, it's difficult to go that far, but

607
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:02,110

I wanted to evolve the battle system in a very positive way.

608
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:08,799
I wanted to evolve the battle system in a very positive way.

610
00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:12,970

We are trying things like strengthening the village system for more people, and also the skit system, which was just announced.

611
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:12,980
We are trying things like strengthening the village system for more people, and also the skit system, which was just announced.

This is also based on the appearance of that day, and is 3D-

based.  I've evolved it, so here is that
Well, in a sense it's a challenge,

617
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:26,930
Well, in a sense it's a challenge,
 

618
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:26,940

 

619
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:33,800

but I think I can provide everyone with new expressions and feelings that weren't possible in the previous series, so I hope you'll

620
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:33,810
but I think I can provide everyone with new expressions and feelings that weren't possible in the previous series, so I hope you'll

00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:38,520
but I think I can provide everyone with new expressions and feelings that weren't possible in the previous series, so I hope you'll
enjoy it.  I'm just introducing it,

622
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:38,530
enjoy it.  I'm just introducing it,
 

623
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:44,100
enjoy it.  I'm just introducing it,
but as far as I can see, it still

think how do you think this dynamic works among different characters?  Could you please

explain how it will be used? I

think this is what everyone thinks, so if you
 

662
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:07,960
think this is what everyone thinks, so if you
receive it, the dynamics will be something that

relationships between the characters in a compelling way within the story or world setting of Sabisa.  The

For example, in battles and other aspects, if you have a

These two are important aspects.  I think it's going to

These two are important aspects.  I think it's going to
 

683

These two are important aspects.  I think it's going to
be a big struggle. The story and the worldview of

can't get along with them right away. I guess
 

720
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:02,040
can't get along with them right away. I guess
it's because I've experienced the plywood in the early stages that I can't get along with them

later on, I think it would be nice to finish from the top. I see, I see. It's

780
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:09,120
later on, I think it would be nice to finish from the top. I see, I see. It's

782
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:11,769

far away, but...  I

783
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:17,979
far away, but...  I
 

784
00:31:17,979 --> 00:31:17,989

 

785
00:31:17,989 --> 00:31:21,849

thought it had to be thin. I thought it had to be thin. I

took a cat and

788
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:23,570
took a cat and
 

789
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:28,090
took a cat and
used it for the closed court. I'm going to make a character called Blue Sea.

790
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:28,100
used it for the closed court. I'm going to make a character called Blue Sea.
 

791
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:32,410
used it for the closed court. I'm going to make a character called Blue Sea.
That's the relationship.  I might be sleeping sometimes.

792
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:32,420
That's the relationship.  I might be sleeping sometimes.
 

793
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:39,100
That's the relationship.  I might be sleeping sometimes.
Avalize seems like an open world game. I'm

794
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:39,110
Avalize seems like an open world game. I'm
 

795
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:42,700
Avalize seems like an open world game. I'm
interested in the story structure. There

796
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:42,710
interested in the story structure. There
 

797
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,580
interested in the story structure. There
are a lot of military flags.

798
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:43,590
are a lot of military flags.
 

799
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:48,110
are a lot of military flags.
Oh, and I'm really curious about how the road will be tied

800
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:48,120
Oh, and I'm really curious about how the road will be tied
 

801
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:53,539
Oh, and I'm really curious about how the road will be tied
to the management's groove and how it will proceed.

802
00:31:53,539 --> 00:31:53,549
to the management's groove and how it will proceed.
 

803

If you know the name, please let me know. It

804
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:57,450
If you know the name, please let me know. It
 

805
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:03,110
If you know the name, please let me know. It
already looks like a world, so I'm going to start packing this time.

806

That's

808
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:03,580
That's
 

809
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:09,150
That's
right. We've made some pretty big improvements to the visual look of the world, so we've gotten a lot of feedback that it does look that way

810
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:09,160
right. We've made some pretty big improvements to the visual look of the world, so we've gotten a lot of feedback that it does look that way

right. We've made some pretty big improvements to the visual look of the world, so we've gotten a lot of feedback that it does look that way
. But, as a

. But, as a
 

813
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:18,750

side note, Arise is not an open-world type of game, it's a game that progresses in a certain direction.  It

side note, Arise is not an open-world type of game, it's a game that progresses in a certain direction.  It

820
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:31,289

game with no detours at all. There are
 

822
00:32:31,299 --> 00:32:37,430
game with no detours at all. There are
also side quests in Duck Village scattered all over the world.  There are

823
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:37,440
also side quests in Duck Village scattered all over the world.  There are
 

824
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:43,009
also side quests in Duck Village scattered all over the world.  There are
many discoveries that can be made by taking a detour,

00:32:43,009 --> 00:32:43,019
many discoveries that can be made by taking a detour,
 

826
00:32:43,019 --> 00:32:48,440
many discoveries that can be made by taking a detour,
so although it's not as surprising as previous Tales of games, there is a

827
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,639
so although it's not as surprising as previous Tales of games, there is a
 

828

829
00:32:49,649 --> 00:32:52,870

greater range of characters and adventures.  I

830
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:55,900
greater range of characters and adventures.  I
 

831
00:32:55,900 --> 00:33:00,670

 

832
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:03,010

 

833

834
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:03,900

think that's what's been created, and also, simply because the characters can jump or swim in the field, it

really does have a lot of action that makes it feel like an open world.

837
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:08,740
really does have a lot of action that makes it feel like an open world.
 

838
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,380
really does have a lot of action that makes it feel like an open world.
This time,

839
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:10,390
This time,
 

840
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:14,190
This time,
So, the

841
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:17,490
So, the
 

842
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:17,500

 

843
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:22,350

feeling of being immersed in this world by controlling the character is really pleasant,

844
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:22,360
feeling of being immersed in this world by controlling the character is really pleasant,
 

845
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,750
feeling of being immersed in this world by controlling the character is really pleasant,
and it's a completely different sensation from previous games.

846
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:28,150
and it's a completely different sensation from previous games.
 

847
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:33,040

 

848
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,050

 

849
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:37,330

So it's not important that it's a co-op mode, but rather that the player

850
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:37,340
So it's not important that it's a co-op mode, but rather that the player
 

851
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:41,230
So it's not important that it's a co-op mode, but rather that the player
can freely control the character, and the

852
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:41,240
can freely control the character, and the
 

853
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:46,110
can freely control the character, and the
character feels as if it's really alive.  It feels like

854
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:46,120
character feels as if it's really alive.  It feels like
 

855
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,169
character feels as if it's really alive.  It feels like
it's been strengthened,

856
00:33:48,169 --> 00:33:48,179
it's been strengthened,
 

857
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:55,950
it's been strengthened,
so I think it's been sold as a school. I

858
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:55,960
so I think it's been sold as a school. I
 

859
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:02,880
so I think it's been sold as a school. I
see, so it's not an open world, but it's a launch, Okihara is especially that dog star,

860
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:02,890
see, so it's not an open world, but it's a launch, Okihara is especially that dog star,
 

861
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:05,910
see, so it's not an open world, but it's a launch, Okihara is especially that dog star,
and when there was a player  I felt that the

862
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:05,920
and when there was a player  I felt that the
 

863
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:09,810
and when there was a player  I felt that the
world was incredibly wide.

864
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:09,820
world was incredibly wide.
 

865
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:15,940
world was incredibly wide.
Well, that's right. In fact, the world is not so wide, but there are many things in the test play.

866
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:19,419
Well, that's right. In fact, the world is not so wide, but there are many things in the test play.
 

867
00:34:19,419 --> 00:34:25,090

 

868
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:25,100

 

869
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:29,260

So, the sense of freedom that you felt there

870
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,700
So, the sense of freedom that you felt there
 

871
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:31,710

 

872
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:35,419

can of course be felt in the main story, and

873
00:34:35,419 --> 00:34:35,429
can of course be felt in the main story, and
 

874
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:39,290
can of course be felt in the main story, and
many such fields are actually connected to each other and create a world that can be accessed

875
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:39,300
many such fields are actually connected to each other and create a world that can be accessed
 

876
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:44,720
many such fields are actually connected to each other and create a world that can be accessed
once you enter the field.  Well, I'll only go once a year.

877
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:44,730
once you enter the field.  Well, I'll only go once a year.
 

878
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:50,930
once you enter the field.  Well, I'll only go once a year.
Actually, that's not the case. There's a hole story, a joker, some kind of subquest, here

879
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:50,940
Actually, that's not the case. There's a hole story, a joker, some kind of subquest, here
 

880
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:51,690
Actually, that's not the case. There's a hole story, a joker, some kind of subquest, here
till the

881
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:51,700
till the
 

882
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:55,950
till the
woman, and once you've landed in a field, it's worth visiting again. There's

883
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:55,960
woman, and once you've landed in a field, it's worth visiting again. There's
 

884
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:04,430
woman, and once you've landed in a field, it's worth visiting again. There's
also that kind of charm in it, so you'll never see that wide world again.  I

885
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:07,310
also that kind of charm in it, so you'll never see that wide world again.  I
 

886
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:07,320

 

887
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:11,350

think the sense of traveling has been strengthened again. Hmm, I'll

888
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:11,360
think the sense of traveling has been strengthened again. Hmm, I'll
 

889
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,050
think the sense of traveling has been strengthened again. Hmm, I'll
wait.

890
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:13,060
wait.
 

891
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:17,060
wait.
Thank you. By the way,

892
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:17,070
Thank you. By the way,
 

893
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:21,560
Thank you. By the way,
Chiara and the viewers have also heard about the tsunami and their

894
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:21,570
Chiara and the viewers have also heard about the tsunami and their
 

895
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:28,760
Chiara and the viewers have also heard about the tsunami and their
pets.  I was really interested in the character, and the name is

896
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:28,770
pets.  I was really interested in the character, and the name is
 

897
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:32,660
pets.  I was really interested in the character, and the name is
similar, but that doesn't matter. I

898
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:32,670
similar, but that doesn't matter. I
 

899
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:37,050
similar, but that doesn't matter. I
really fell in love with him because he's so cool. I'm really interested in his

900
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:37,060
really fell in love with him because he's so cool. I'm really interested in his
 

901
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:45,150
really fell in love with him because he's so cool. I'm really interested in his
personality and battle side.  Please let me know in detail. I was

902
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:45,160
personality and battle side.  Please let me know in detail. I was
 

903
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:50,730
personality and battle side.  Please let me know in detail. I was
also very proud. I saw Kisara once and I was interested in her. Well, she is a cool woman, there

904
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:50,740
also very proud. I saw Kisara once and I was interested in her. Well, she is a cool woman, there
 

905
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,470
also very proud. I saw Kisara once and I was interested in her. Well, she is a cool woman, there
is no doubt about it, but

906
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:52,480
is no doubt about it, but
 

907
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,460
is no doubt about it, but
what in particular caught my attention? I don't

908
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:56,470
what in particular caught my attention? I don't
 

909
00:35:56,470 --> 00:36:06,390
what in particular caught my attention? I don't
like that outfit. I really like her.  He has some strong equipment and a really

910
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:06,400
like that outfit. I really like her.  He has some strong equipment and a really
 

911
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,950
like that outfit. I really like her.  He has some strong equipment and a really
big shield. It's not very expensive. I

912
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:10,960
big shield. It's not very expensive. I
 

913
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:16,480
big shield. It's not very expensive. I
don't think you'll see a character using that as a weapon in other games.  I think that the

914
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:16,490
don't think you'll see a character using that as a weapon in other games.  I think that the
 

915
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:23,859
don't think you'll see a character using that as a weapon in other games.  I think that the
shield is a good weapon for the prefecture distance, and I

916
00:36:23,859 --> 00:36:23,869
shield is a good weapon for the prefecture distance, and I
 

917
00:36:23,869 --> 00:36:28,180
shield is a good weapon for the prefecture distance, and I
wanted to be protected in the position I wanted to protect.

918
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:28,190
wanted to be protected in the position I wanted to protect.
 

919
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:42,930
wanted to be protected in the position I wanted to protect.
[Laughs] I

920
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:46,830

 

921
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:50,160

 

922
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:50,170

 

923
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:55,190

1128

also at various times while playing.

It happens, just

1131
00:45:05,019 --> 00:45:05,029
It happens, just
 

1132
00:45:05,029 --> 00:45:08,229
It happens, just
like in the Teruzo series. It

1133
00:45:08,229 --> 00:45:08,239
like in the Teruzo series. It
 

1134
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:15,309
like in the Teruzo series. It
sometimes happens at special moments, and sometimes it just pops up.  There

1135
00:45:15,309 --> 00:45:17,949
sometimes happens at special moments, and sometimes it just pops up.  There
 

1136

1137
00:45:17,959 --> 00:45:23,670

are some posts that you can read if you are interested in them, so as always, you

1138
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:23,680
are some posts that you can read if you are interested in them, so as always, you
 

1139
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:29,190
are some posts that you can read if you are interested in them, so as always, you
can think of them as a moment to take a break from your travels, but I

1140
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:29,200
can think of them as a moment to take a break from your travels, but I
 

1141
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:33,240
can think of them as a moment to take a break from your travels, but I
think Arise is a big  There has been an evolution

1142
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:33,250
think Arise is a big  There has been an evolution
 

1143
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:36,630
think Arise is a big  There has been an evolution
in the 3D model,

1144
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:36,640
in the 3D model,
 

1145
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,870
in the 3D model,
so I'm sure it's something that has changed. I see. It's a bit

1146
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:39,880
so I'm sure it's something that has changed. I see. It's a bit
 

1147
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:46,140
so I'm sure it's something that has changed. I see. It's a bit
like that, but it's not just that, it's also in 3D. I think you can

1148
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:46,150
like that, but it's not just that, it's also in 3D. I think you can
 

1149
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:50,940
like that, but it's not just that, it's also in 3D. I think you can
play all the skits that I just watched.  I

1150
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:50,950
play all the skits that I just watched.  I
 

1151
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:55,970
play all the skits that I just watched.  I
think there was a frame with a slightly big style, but it

1152
00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:55,980
think there was a frame with a slightly big style, but it
 

1153
00:45:55,980 --> 00:46:14,530
think there was a frame with a slightly big style, but it

1154
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:14,540

 

1155
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:17,609

has a cherry blossom edge that has fallen in the day,

1156
00:46:17,609 --> 00:46:17,619
has a cherry blossom edge that has fallen in the day,
 

1157
00:46:17,619 --> 00:46:20,640
has a cherry blossom edge that has fallen in the day,
so what's good about it is that it gives

1158
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:20,650
so what's good about it is that it gives
 

1159
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:23,730
so what's good about it is that it gives
you the feeling that you felt when you played.  It

1160
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:27,750
you the feeling that you felt when you played.  It
 

1161
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:31,569

1168
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:49,880

That's what I wanted to aim for this time. I want it to feel natural, so natural that you don't even notice it. I

1169
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:49,890
That's what I wanted to aim for this time. I want it to feel natural, so natural that you don't even notice it. I

That's the concept this time.

Skid is evolving somehow.  There are

1175
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:00,140
Skid is evolving somehow.  There are
 

1176
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:07,180
Skid is evolving somehow.  There are
still some scenes left, and I'm really looking forward to the one with Phil.

Yes, that girl's skit is

1179
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:10,740
Yes, that girl's skit is
 

1180
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:15,920
Yes, that girl's skit is
like, as I said before, in the main scenario, Reina

1181
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:15,930
like, as I said before, in the main scenario, Reina
 

1182
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:22,400
like, as I said before, in the main scenario, Reina
is in a very dominant relationship.  However, I also tried to make it seem like the characters might not be able to get along,

1183
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:22,410
is in a very dominant relationship.  However, I also tried to make it seem like the characters might not be able to get along,
 

1184
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:30,950
is in a very dominant relationship.  However, I also tried to make it seem like the characters might not be able to get along,
but when I

1185
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:30,960
but when I
 

1186
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:35,359
but when I
looked closer, I was able to see a warm and

1187
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:35,369
looked closer, I was able to see a warm and
 

1188
00:47:35,369 --> 00:47:41,270
looked closer, I was able to see a warm and
gentle side of the characters.  It's like the characters have softened a little bit, and the way they're layered in so many small details

1189
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:41,280
gentle side of the characters.  It's like the characters have softened a little bit, and the way they're layered in so many small details
 

1190
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,960
gentle side of the characters.  It's like the characters have softened a little bit, and the way they're layered in so many small details
is what makes it so Tales of.  I

1191
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,579
is what makes it so Tales of.  I
 

1192
00:47:46,579 --> 00:47:51,469

 

1193
00:47:51,469 --> 00:47:54,609

 

1194

1195
00:47:57,850 --> 00:47:57,860

 

1196
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:05,440

think that app and Hii are interesting. I think that the pressure 3D helper is another one.

1197
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:05,450
think that app and Hii are interesting. I think that the pressure 3D helper is another one.
 

1198
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:12,880
think that app and Hii are interesting. I think that the pressure 3D helper is another one.
Isn't it like a lime or something? I

1199
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:12,890

 

1200
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:16,770

want to see it here till. I was wearing something like a cafe book,

1201
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:16,780
want to see it here till. I was wearing something like a cafe book,
 

1202
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:21,420
want to see it here till. I was wearing something like a cafe book,
but that's also in the game.  So, you can get it under the condition that it ends, but

1203
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:21,430
but that's also in the game.  So, you can get it under the condition that it ends, but
 

1204
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:26,940
but that's also in the game.  So, you can get it under the condition that it ends, but
if you want to enjoy something like a chicken dish skit, you'll naturally get a skit.

1205
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:26,950
if you want to enjoy something like a chicken dish skit, you'll naturally get a skit.
 

1206
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:30,570
if you want to enjoy something like a chicken dish skit, you'll naturally get a skit.
As mentioned above, the clothes are also good, but

1207
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:30,580
As mentioned above, the clothes are also good, but
 

1208
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:36,760
As mentioned above, the clothes are also good, but
all of them are reflected, so it will be a disease that has not existed in the previous skip, so I

1209
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:36,770
all of them are reflected, so it will be a disease that has not existed in the previous skip, so I
 

1210
00:48:36,770 --> 00:48:40,210
all of them are reflected, so it will be a disease that has not existed in the previous skip, so I
would like you to enjoy this Neyoru play.

1211
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:40,220
would like you to enjoy this Neyoru play.
 

1212
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:45,760
would like you to enjoy this Neyoru play.
Then the skit will be  I'm not waiting for the suicide note, but if I

1213
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:45,770
Then the skit will be  I'm not waiting for the suicide note, but if I
 

1214
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:50,860
Then the skit will be  I'm not waiting for the suicide note, but if I
dress up the character in that costume, will they appear in the skit together? That's

1215
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:51,490
dress up the character in that costume, will they appear in the skit together? That's
 

1216
00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:51,500

 

1217
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:56,790

what I mean. So, that Oarai chair is serious.  The

1218
00:48:56,790 --> 00:48:56,800
what I mean. So, that Oarai chair is serious.  The
 

1219
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:04,490
what I mean. So, that Oarai chair is serious.  The
sound of the movie scene of the character's emergence is of course all 3D, so

1220
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:04,500
sound of the movie scene of the character's emergence is of course all 3D, so
 

1221
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:10,010
sound of the movie scene of the character's emergence is of course all 3D, so

really looking forward to it, I'm really excited. I saw this video, but I

1232
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:38,240

was thinking about the competition, especially when I was playing at home, about roast chicken and my mother.  It looked really delicious

and the
 

1236
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:43,940
and the
pose he made after eating the spirit species was really cool. I

1237

1240
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:50,990

want to know what kind of effect the food in this game has.  Are

1241
00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:51,000
want to know what kind of effect the food in this game has.  Are
 

1242

want to know what kind of effect the food in this game has.  Are
there any character events related to cooking

there any character events related to cooking
 

1244

there any character events related to cooking
? Yes, cooking this time is something that happens a lot at this timing.

1247
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:04,740

Of course, you can do it at the inn,

00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:04,750
Of course, you can do it at the inn,
 

1249
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:12,370
Of course, you can do it at the inn,
but the way to do it is to do it outdoors.

1250
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:12,380
but the way to do it is to do it outdoors.
 

1251
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:15,859

I want people to enjoy cooking in that way, but if

really looking forward to cooking. In the second picture, there was

really looking forward to cooking. In the second picture, there was
 

1285
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:31,190
really looking forward to cooking. In the second picture, there was
talk about cooking, but actually, Mr. A was the one who

00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:31,200
talk about cooking, but actually, Mr. A was the one who
 

1287
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:35,780
talk about cooking, but actually, Mr. A was the one who
got to play the trial ROM a little earlier.  It

Re Berry,

1293
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:44,160
Re Berry,
 

1294
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,010
Re Berry,
yes, it's amazing. The

1295
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:46,020
yes, it's amazing. The
 

1296
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:47,310
yes, it's amazing. The
parent's curtain was 9,

1297
00:51:47,310 --> 00:51:47,320
parent's curtain was 9,
 

1298
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:54,870
parent's curtain was 9,
but that's my impression after doing it.

1299
00:51:54,870 --> 00:51:54,880
but that's my impression after doing it.
 

1300
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,790
but that's my impression after doing it.
First of all, the one that's

1301
00:51:57,790 --> 00:51:57,800
First of all, the one that's
 

1302
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:02,870
First of all, the one that's
really big is the big tree.

1303
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:02,880

 

1304
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:06,089

For example,

1305
00:52:06,089 --> 00:52:06,099
For example,
 

1306
00:52:06,099 --> 00:52:13,890
For example,
when playing baccarat, the switching between your brain and the field is

1307
00:52:13,890 --> 00:52:13,900
when playing baccarat, the switching between your brain and the field is
 

1308
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:15,900
when playing baccarat, the switching between your brain and the field is
quick and smooth, so you don't

1309
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:15,910
quick and smooth, so you don't
 

1310
00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:24,089
quick and smooth, so you don't
have to wait. Because it's so fast, it's really easy to go from one battle to the next.  I

1311
00:52:24,089 --> 00:52:26,109
have to wait. Because it's so fast, it's really easy to go from one battle to the next.  I
 

1312
00:52:26,109 --> 00:52:26,119

 

1313
00:52:26,119 --> 00:52:29,860

wonder if there is no fun in it. I see

1314
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:29,870
wonder if there is no fun in it. I see
 

1315
00:52:29,870 --> 00:52:35,030
wonder if there is no fun in it. I see
. Thank you. This time, the battle is the

1316
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:35,040
. Thank you. This time, the battle is the
 

1317
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:42,070
. Thank you. This time, the battle is the
so-called encounter method, which is the parent and legacy method, but it's

1318
00:52:42,070 --> 00:52:42,080

 

1319
00:52:42,080 --> 00:53:01,530

like a good woman.

1320
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:01,540
like a good woman.
 

1321
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:07,260
like a good woman.
Well, there are a few different opinions on this, but

1322
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:07,270
Well, there are a few different opinions on this, but
 

1323
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:12,300
Well, there are a few different opinions on this, but
until now, after the battle,

1324
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:12,310
until now, after the battle,
 

1325
00:53:12,310 --> 00:53:16,770
until now, after the battle,
In the results, there was a sequence where the characters stood up and talked,

1326
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:16,780
In the results, there was a sequence where the characters stood up and talked,
 

1327
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:19,810
In the results, there was a sequence where the characters stood up and talked,
but now they were

1328
00:53:19,810 --> 00:53:22,339
but now they were
 

1329
00:53:22,339 --> 00:53:22,349

 

1330
00:53:22,349 --> 00:53:26,390

going to return to the field and have 8 voices expressing themselves

1331
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:26,400
going to return to the field and have 8 voices expressing themselves
 

1332
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:31,999
going to return to the field and have 8 voices expressing themselves
like that.  The comments from the other participants were interesting,

1333
00:53:31,999 --> 00:53:32,009
like that.  The comments from the other participants were interesting,
 

1334
00:53:32,009 --> 00:53:34,070
like that.  The comments from the other participants were interesting,
but I felt that there was no

1335
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:34,080
but I felt that there was no
 

1336
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:39,590
but I felt that there was no
awkwardness when I went from paddling to fielding, and it

1337
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:39,600
awkwardness when I went from paddling to fielding, and it
 

1338
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:45,800
awkwardness when I went from paddling to fielding, and it
went smoothly, which is why I thought it was great, but I

1339
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:45,810
went smoothly, which is why I thought it was great, but I
 

1340
00:53:45,810 --> 00:53:50,720
went smoothly, which is why I thought it was great, but I
think that this time we want to aim for a little more balance.  You enter the headquarters, you go out again, and then you have the next battle. We've

1341
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:50,730
think that this time we want to aim for a little more balance.  You enter the headquarters, you go out again, and then you have the next battle. We've
 

1342
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:54,089
think that this time we want to aim for a little more balance.  You enter the headquarters, you go out again, and then you have the next battle. We've
adjusted the pace of the battle system a little bit, so that

1343
00:53:54,089 --> 00:53:54,099
adjusted the pace of the battle system a little bit, so that
 

1344
00:53:54,099 --> 00:53:56,780
adjusted the pace of the battle system a little bit, so that
everyone can enjoy it at the store.  I

1345
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:58,520
everyone can enjoy it at the store.  I
 

1346
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:03,960

 

1347
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:08,160

 

1348
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:14,010

 

1349
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:20,300

 

1350
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:20,310

 

1351
00:54:20,310 --> 00:54:23,950

guess you could call it the field member system, but I really want everyone to try it out as soon as possible and I hope that you'll have a positive experience with it.  I also feel

1352
00:54:23,950 --> 00:54:28,329
guess you could call it the field member system, but I really want everyone to try it out as soon as possible and I hope that you'll have a positive experience with it.  I also feel
 

1353
00:54:28,329 --> 00:54:31,500

 

1354
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:31,510

 

1355
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:32,650


1356
00:54:32,650 --> 00:54:32,660

 

1357
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:38,589

relieved now, and I think it's natural that many people say that things have changed since then.

1358
00:54:38,589 --> 00:54:38,599
relieved now, and I think it's natural that many people say that things have changed since then.
 

1359
00:54:38,599 --> 00:54:42,670
relieved now, and I think it's natural that many people say that things have changed since then.
Of course, I think there will be a lot of comments like that,

1360
00:54:42,670 --> 00:54:42,680
Of course, I think there will be a lot of comments like that,
 

1361
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:43,690
Of course, I think there will be a lot of comments like that,
but

1362
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:43,700
but
 

1363
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:46,430
but
this is our own opinion.

1364
00:54:46,430 --> 00:54:47,870
this is our own opinion.
 

1365
00:54:47,870 --> 00:54:47,880

 

1366
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:53,359

Although it is a brand called Telezorb, we have one big goal, which is to have many people play this game without feeling uncomfortable. So we had to think

1367
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:56,660
Although it is a brand called Telezorb, we have one big goal, which is to have many people play this game without feeling uncomfortable. So we had to think
 

1368
00:54:56,660 --> 00:55:00,490

 

1369
00:55:00,490 --> 00:55:02,320

 

1370

1371
00:55:02,330 --> 00:55:07,840

about how to strike a balance.  That was also something I was worried about, so I think that's the

1372
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:07,850
about how to strike a balance.  That was also something I was worried about, so I think that's the
 

1373
00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:09,100
about how to strike a balance.  That was also something I was worried about, so I think that's the

1374
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:10,570

 

1375
00:55:10,570 --> 00:55:12,550

 

1376
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:12,560

 

1377
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:15,880

right thing to do. If people who have watched the series so far can respond in a positive way, then

1378
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:19,740
right thing to do. If people who have watched the series so far can respond in a positive way, then
 

1379
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:19,750

 

1380
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:24,270

that's the best answer.  I don't know if it's true, but I

1381
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:27,320
that's the best answer.  I don't know if it's true, but I
 

1382
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:27,330

 

1383
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:31,070

feel like Laserrise is not necessarily wrong in what it wants to achieve, so I'm

1384
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:31,080
feel like Laserrise is not necessarily wrong in what it wants to achieve, so I'm
 

1385
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:33,460
feel like Laserrise is not necessarily wrong in what it wants to achieve, so I'm
still

1386
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:33,470
still
 

1387
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:37,060
still
struggling with this, but I'm trying all sorts of things.  Of

1388
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:37,070
struggling with this, but I'm trying all sorts of things.  Of
 

1389
00:55:37,070 --> 00:55:40,810
struggling with this, but I'm trying all sorts of things.  Of
course, that's

1390
00:55:40,810 --> 00:55:40,820
course, that's
 

1391
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:45,640
course, that's
not all there is to it, so I think there will be a lot of different opinions,

1392
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:45,650
not all there is to it, so I think there will be a lot of different opinions,
 

1393
00:55:45,650 --> 00:55:47,800
not all there is to it, so I think there will be a lot of different opinions,
but I'd like to

1394
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,630
but I'd like to
 

1395
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:49,640

 

1396
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:53,710

take that into account and make the series better in the future.  I

1397
00:55:53,710 --> 00:56:00,190
take that into account and make the series better in the future.  I
 

1398
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:05,230

 

1399
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:05,240

 

1400
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:05,860


1401
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:05,870

 

1402
00:56:05,870 --> 00:56:13,060

think the balance was very well done, and when I found out about it, I realized that Kochi was very personal.

1403
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:13,070
think the balance was very well done, and when I found out about it, I realized that Kochi was very personal.

But I really liked this one. Yes, it's a good question to ask.

1405
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:18,920
But I really liked this one. Yes, it's a good question to ask.
 

1406
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:23,590
But I really liked this one. Yes, it's a good question to ask.
Oh, I have another impression.

1407
00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:23,600
Oh, I have another impression.
 

1408
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,850
Oh, I have another impression.
Well, I

1409
00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:25,860
Well, I
 

1410
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:31,250
Well, I
think that in the test, we probably exceeded the limit by a large margin, but

1411
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:31,260
think that in the test, we probably exceeded the limit by a large margin, but
 

1412
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:35,680
think that in the test, we probably exceeded the limit by a large margin, but
even so, we weren't aiming for something

1413
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:35,690
even so, we weren't aiming for something
 

1414
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:41,410
even so, we weren't aiming for something
high, and as we walked towards the 22nd, we were able to swim and

1415
00:56:41,410 --> 00:56:41,420
high, and as we walked towards the 22nd, we were able to swim and
 

1416
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:46,480
high, and as we walked towards the 22nd, we were able to swim and
there were waterfalls and such.  I went there to visit Atsuto and there

1417
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:46,490
there were waterfalls and such.  I went there to visit Atsuto and there
 

1418
00:56:46,490 --> 00:56:52,480
there were waterfalls and such.  I went there to visit Atsuto and there
was a treasure there, but I wasn't aiming for it, the scenery was so

1419
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:52,490
was a treasure there, but I wasn't aiming for it, the scenery was so
 

1420
00:56:52,490 --> 00:56:53,530
was a treasure there, but I wasn't aiming for it, the scenery was so
beautiful and I

1421
00:56:53,530 --> 00:56:55,610
beautiful and I
 

1422
00:56:55,610 --> 00:56:55,620

 

1423
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:58,210

enjoyed going for a walk, and I

enjoyed going for a walk, and I
 

1425
00:56:59,839 --> 00:56:59,849

 

1426
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:02,289

got so absorbed in it.  It was really

1427
00:57:02,289 --> 00:57:02,299
got so absorbed in it.  It was really
 

1428
00:57:02,299 --> 00:57:07,599
got so absorbed in it.  It was really
fun to go for a walk. Thank you.

1429
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:07,609
fun to go for a walk. Thank you.
 

1430
00:57:07,609 --> 00:57:13,790
fun to go for a walk. Thank you.
For example, even if there was no public, I was told that I had fun shampooing. Kuroko: I

For example, even if there was no public, I was told that I had fun shampooing. Kuroko: I
think that people really enjoy making field art.

1433
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:18,390
think that people really enjoy making field art.

Usually, there is a treasure chest at the top of the roof.  Yes, there is something beneficial about the game,

so the basic idea is to go ahead and try it, but I

so the basic idea is to go ahead and try it, but I

1439
00:57:33,819 --> 00:57:38,040

think it's not just about that, I want to make people want to go beyond that.  It's really powerful, but if you

1440
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:38,050
think it's not just about that, I want to make people want to go beyond that.  It's really powerful, but if you

don't put in the effort, you'll have a tomorrow in the game. We're making it, and I

feel like it's a beautiful thing. After I prepared the bill, I thought that way, but that wasn't all.

1444
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:50,550
feel like it's a beautiful thing. After I prepared the bill, I thought that way, but that wasn't all.
 

1445
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:50,560

 

1446
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:53,580

This time, I went to the swimming pool and it reminded me of the day I went swimming. I was

1447
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:53,590
This time, I went to the swimming pool and it reminded me of the day I went swimming. I was
 

1448
00:57:53,590 --> 00:57:58,860
This time, I went to the swimming pool and it reminded me of the day I went swimming. I was
able to jump from a high place and do a big jump. I wanted to

1449
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:00,810
able to jump from a high place and do a big jump. I wanted to
 

1450

1451
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:05,730

try it because I could do that.  It was

1452
00:58:05,730 --> 00:58:09,910
try it because I could do that.  It was
 

1453

1457
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:15,870

only when I had that kind of feeling that I wanted to go on an adventure as a game, that I was able to fully experience it. I really

1458
00:58:15,870 --> 00:58:15,880
only when I had that kind of feeling that I wanted to go on an adventure as a game, that I was able to fully experience it. I really

00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:20,700
only when I had that kind of feeling that I wanted to go on an adventure as a game, that I was able to fully experience it. I really
wanted to be a doctor, and of course, that was one of the things I wanted to do in the previous Tales games.  The

1460
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:20,710
wanted to be a doctor, and of course, that was one of the things I wanted to do in the previous Tales games.  The

nest with the characters is the

1462
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:23,190
nest with the characters is the
 

1463
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:27,980
nest with the characters is the
most important brand, and that doesn't change in Arai's case, but even

1464
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:27,990
most important brand, and that doesn't change in Arai's case, but even
 

1465
00:58:27,990 --> 00:58:31,370
most important brand, and that doesn't change in Arai's case, but even
so, I still want to take a little detour and think

1466
00:58:31,370 --> 00:58:35,130
so, I still want to take a little detour and think
 

1467
00:58:35,130 --> 00:58:35,140

 

1468
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:38,580

about how I can approach the beautiful end of the year and how I can get there.  The ability to

1469
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:38,590
about how I can approach the beautiful end of the year and how I can get there.  The ability to
 

1470
00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:42,860
about how I can approach the beautiful end of the year and how I can get there.  The ability to
cast spells on the world in front of you

1471
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:42,870
cast spells on the world in front of you
 

1472
00:58:42,870 --> 00:58:43,770
cast spells on the world in front of you

1473
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:43,780

 

1474
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:47,810

is something we want to emphasize as an RPG, so we

1475
00:58:47,810 --> 00:58:47,820
is something we want to emphasize as an RPG, so we
 

1476
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:50,870
is something we want to emphasize as an RPG, so we
really want to

1477
00:58:50,870 --> 00:58:50,880
really want to
 

1478
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:56,790
really want to
add a variety of new features that match what you can do with that game.  That is,

1479
00:58:56,790 --> 00:58:56,800
add a variety of new features that match what you can do with that game.  That is,
 

1480
00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:01,840
add a variety of new features that match what you can do with that game.  That is,
in the end, the things you need to know to feel the characters don't change.

1481
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:01,850
in the end, the things you need to know to feel the characters don't change.
 

1482
00:59:01,850 --> 00:59:06,380
in the end, the things you need to know to feel the characters don't change.
So I don't want to open up the world,

1483
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:06,390
So I don't want to open up the world,
 

1484
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:13,549
So I don't want to open up the world,
but I think a world that opens up the way to portray the characters is a better way to portray them.  It

1485
00:59:13,549 --> 00:59:13,559
but I think a world that opens up the way to portray the characters is a better way to portray them.  It
 

1486
00:59:13,559 --> 00:59:15,740
but I think a world that opens up the way to portray the characters is a better way to portray them.  It
will also be a tool for

1487
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:18,500
will also be a tool for
 

1488
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:18,510

 

1489
00:59:18,510 --> 00:59:23,240

If the characters have a conversation with each other and say, "Wow, we've come so far,"

1490
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:23,250
If the characters have a conversation with each other and say, "Wow, we've come so far,"
 

1491
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:29,530
If the characters have a conversation with each other and say, "Wow, we've come so far,"
and if that's how the appeal of Api is expressed, then a

1492
00:59:29,530 --> 00:59:29,540
and if that's how the appeal of Api is expressed, then a
 

1493
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:32,970
and if that's how the appeal of Api is expressed, then a
home is more important than that.  I think

1494
00:59:32,970 --> 00:59:32,980
home is more important than that.  I think
 

1495
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:35,950
home is more important than that.  I think
that

1496
00:59:35,950 --> 00:59:35,960
that
 

1497
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:40,100
that
in a sense, it's about the level of detail, or the perspective, of how much of this

1498
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:40,110
in a sense, it's about the level of detail, or the perspective, of how much of this
 

1499
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:42,460
in a sense, it's about the level of detail, or the perspective, of how much of this
world we want to create, both

1500
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:42,470
world we want to create, both
 

1501
00:59:42,470 --> 00:59:45,930
world we want to create, both
horizontally and in this world. I remember having

1502
00:59:45,930 --> 00:59:47,310
horizontally and in this world. I remember having
 

1503
00:59:47,310 --> 00:59:47,320

 

1504
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:49,570

quite a few discussions about that, and

1505
00:59:49,570 --> 00:59:51,089
quite a few discussions about that, and
 

1506
00:59:51,089 --> 00:59:51,099

 

1507
00:59:51,099 --> 00:59:56,250

in order to achieve that,  You

1508
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:56,260
in order to achieve that,  You
 

1509
00:59:56,260 --> 01:00:01,440
in order to achieve that,  You
may have noticed that, apart from the skips and movie scenes, we

1510
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:01,450
may have noticed that, apart from the skips and movie scenes, we
 

1511
01:00:01,450 --> 01:00:06,460
may have noticed that, apart from the skips and movie scenes, we
have what we call short chats, which are voice-only conversations. In other words, the automatic chats that play

1512
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:06,470
have what we call short chats, which are voice-only conversations. In other words, the automatic chats that play
 

1513
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:09,440
have what we call short chats, which are voice-only conversations. In other words, the automatic chats that play
whenever you're adventuring in the field are  That

1514
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,460
whenever you're adventuring in the field are  That
 

1515
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:11,470

Because I was doing a test play, I tried switching to other characters and fighting,

everyone was easy to fight and it was fun, so this time I
 

1561

used various characters instead of the opposite.  I thought it would be like this. There was a

exactly what I was thinking when I was in charge of the video.  The

01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:13,630
exactly what I was thinking when I was in charge of the video.  The
 

1571
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:19,559
exactly what I was thinking when I was in charge of the video.  The
series will also have 6 or 8 characters, and no matter how much the

battles will be exciting, but I've
 

1577
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:32,540
battles will be exciting, but I've
been hiding the game designer, but it's pretty

01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:32,550
been hiding the game designer, but it's pretty
 

1579
01:02:32,550 --> 01:02:35,750
been hiding the game designer, but it's pretty
hard to say most of them, which is an

01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:35,760
hard to say most of them, which is an
 

1581
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:39,030
hard to say most of them, which is an
exaggeration.  Even if you take it, there are still a lot of people

01:02:39,030 --> 01:02:39,040
exaggeration.  Even if you take it, there are still a lot of people

So we're not the only ones that don't change the character, right? I

1584
01:02:43,110 --> 01:02:43,120
So we're not the only ones that don't change the character, right? I
 

1585
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:47,010
So we're not the only ones that don't change the character, right? I
think that's the majority.

1586
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:47,020
think that's the majority.

But we really put in eight times as much effort

1588
01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:51,280
But we really put in eight times as much effort
 

1589
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:54,190
But we really put in eight times as much effort
into designing the character bottle.

1590
01:02:54,190 --> 01:02:54,200
into designing the character bottle.

Well, it would be a shame if people couldn't enjoy it, and it

1592

Well, it would be a shame if people couldn't enjoy it, and it
 

1593
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:02,779
Well, it would be a shame if people couldn't enjoy it, and it
would mean that they weren't able to experience the real charm of the work, so I wanted

1594
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:02,789
would mean that they weren't able to experience the real charm of the work, so I wanted
 

1595
01:03:02,789 --> 01:03:07,849
would mean that they weren't able to experience the real charm of the work, so I wanted
to somehow clear that up as a sort of operation.  It's

1596
01:03:07,849 --> 01:03:07,859
to somehow clear that up as a sort of operation.  It's
 

1597
01:03:07,859 --> 01:03:12,550
to somehow clear that up as a sort of operation.  It's
easy to do. First of all, there are two things I did: the

1598
01:03:12,550 --> 01:03:14,210
easy to do. First of all, there are two things I did: the
 

1599
01:03:14,210 --> 01:03:14,220

 

1600
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:17,720

Booster Pack and the Boost Strike. The

1601
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:17,730
Booster Pack and the Boost Strike. The
 

1602
01:03:17,730 --> 01:03:19,000
Booster Pack and the Boost Strike. The

1603
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,610

 

1604
01:03:20,610 --> 01:03:20,620

 

1605
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:24,210

serving character can perform the support action at these two airy instants. I

1606
01:03:24,210 --> 01:03:24,220
serving character can perform the support action at these two airy instants. I
 

1607
01:03:24,220 --> 01:03:28,650
serving character can perform the support action at these two airy instants. I
think this was also a kind of lethal force. You

1608
01:03:28,650 --> 01:03:28,660
think this was also a kind of lethal force. You
 

1609
01:03:28,660 --> 01:03:29,360
think this was also a kind of lethal force. You
know,

1610
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:29,370
know,
 

1611
01:03:29,370 --> 01:03:30,340
know,
you

1612
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:30,350
you
 

1613
01:03:30,350 --> 01:03:32,349
you
're fighting together.

01:03:32,349 --> 01:03:32,359
're fighting together.
 

1615
01:03:32,359 --> 01:03:35,739
're fighting together.
First of all, the feeling is to

1616
01:03:35,739 --> 01:03:35,749
First of all, the feeling is to
 

1617
01:03:35,749 --> 01:03:39,789
First of all, the feeling is to
make the audience feel like they're at a concert, and what we're

1618
01:03:39,789 --> 01:03:39,799
make the audience feel like they're at a concert, and what we're
 

1619

make the audience feel like they're at a concert, and what we're
trying to do is to make it

1620
01:03:41,670 --> 01:03:46,440
trying to do is to make it
 

1621
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:46,450

 

1622
01:03:46,450 --> 01:03:51,360

so that you can quickly switch characters even during battles with your boots, which may have been a feature of the game.

1623
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:51,370
so that you can quickly switch characters even during battles with your boots, which may have been a feature of the game.

so that you can quickly switch characters even during battles with your boots, which may have been a feature of the game.
So, I thought, "Maybe I should just manipulate it a little bit," and

1625
01:03:58,410 --> 01:03:58,420
So, I thought, "Maybe I should just manipulate it a little bit," and
 

1626
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:01,660
So, I thought, "Maybe I should just manipulate it a little bit," and
when I thought about it, I

1627
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:01,670
when I thought about it, I
 

1628

1631
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:10,350

could change my mood and strategy.  I

1632
01:04:10,350 --> 01:04:14,610
could change my mood and strategy.  I
 

1633
01:04:14,610 --> 01:04:14,620

 

1634
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:18,210

tried to make it possible to change characters very smoothly, so I really

1635
01:04:18,210 --> 01:04:18,220
tried to make it possible to change characters very smoothly, so I really
 

1636
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:22,320
tried to make it possible to change characters very smoothly, so I really
want everyone to try it out. I

1637
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:22,330
want everyone to try it out. I
 

1638
01:04:22,330 --> 01:04:25,530
want everyone to try it out. I
especially liked being able to switch to Lee Si-yeon Jan when there was a target.

of course, when you plan to use it,  By doing so yourself, you can
expand such opportunities.

1654
01:04:50,950 --> 01:04:55,520

It's really about how you manage the characters other than yourself or the characters you're investigating, in line with the play style of the person at that point.  There

01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:30,650
think that the individuality of the six characters has been greatly strengthened, and
in that sense, I wanted to try them all out.

1667
01:05:30,650 --> 01:05:32,630
in that sense, I wanted to try them all out.
 

1668
01:05:32,630 --> 01:05:32,640

 

1669
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:36,670

I received a very sweet impression.  I

1670
01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:36,680
I received a very sweet impression.  I
 

1671
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:40,240
I received a very sweet impression.  I
'm happy.

1672
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:40,250
'm happy.
 

1673
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:47,470
'm happy.
By the way, I think that for those who are playing for the first time, I would recommend the main character Arufen.

1674
01:05:47,470 --> 01:05:49,240
By the way, I think that for those who are playing for the first time, I would recommend the main character Arufen.
 

1675
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:50,060

 

1676
01:05:50,060 --> 01:05:54,800

 

1677
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:57,840

 

1678
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:57,850

 

1679
01:05:57,850 --> 01:06:01,740

Good night, is there a character that is easy to play and easy to operate? A parrot. Well, there is one in the morning.  As you said, the most obvious thing about the former is that it

1680
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:01,750
Good night, is there a character that is easy to play and easy to operate? A parrot. Well, there is one in the morning.  As you said, the most obvious thing about the former is that it
 

1681
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:08,370
Good night, is there a character that is easy to play and easy to operate? A parrot. Well, there is one in the morning.  As you said, the most obvious thing about the former is that it
can be used in a wide range of situations, such as school plays, and the

1682
01:06:08,370 --> 01:06:08,380
can be used in a wide range of situations, such as school plays, and the
 

1683
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:10,430
can be used in a wide range of situations, such as school plays, and the
former has an all-powerful,

1684
01:06:10,430 --> 01:06:10,440
former has an all-powerful,
 

1685
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:13,520
former has an all-powerful,
attack-centered charm.

1686
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:13,530
attack-centered charm.
 

1687
01:06:13,530 --> 01:06:17,250
attack-centered charm.
For example, while maintaining that aspect, the former

1688
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:17,260
For example, while maintaining that aspect, the former
 

1689
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:22,890
For example, while maintaining that aspect, the former
can also use spirit arts at the same time.  There is a character called Mu who is an underclassman who is a town lover,

1690
01:06:22,890 --> 01:06:22,900
can also use spirit arts at the same time.  There is a character called Mu who is an underclassman who is a town lover,
 

1691
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:25,260
can also use spirit arts at the same time.  There is a character called Mu who is an underclassman who is a town lover,
but he is

1692
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:25,270
but he is
 

1693
01:06:25,270 --> 01:06:26,769
but he is
already a person who

1694
01:06:26,769 --> 01:06:31,430
already a person who
 

1695
01:06:31,430 --> 01:06:31,440

 

1696
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:35,030

can be loved by others. He is a right-hand man who is a java. He is a person who can be loved by others ...

1697
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:35,040
can be loved by others. He is a right-hand man who is a java. He is a person who can be loved by others ...
 

1698
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:44,410
can be loved by others. He is a right-hand man who is a java. He is a person who can be loved by others ...
But

1699
01:06:44,410 --> 01:06:44,420

 

1700
01:06:44,420 --> 01:06:46,160

this time,

1701
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:46,170
this time,
 

1702
01:06:46,170 --> 01:06:48,529
this time,
the three characters in the series are,

1703
01:06:48,529 --> 01:06:48,539
the three characters in the series are,
 

1704
01:06:48,539 --> 01:06:52,349
the three characters in the series are,
well, that person is, well,

1705
01:06:52,349 --> 01:06:52,359
well, that person is, well,
 

1706
01:06:52,359 --> 01:06:54,170
well, that person is, well,
in that sense, well, it's

1707
01:06:54,170 --> 01:06:54,180
in that sense, well, it's
 

1708
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:57,260
in that sense, well, it's
a bit, well, well, let's go

1709
01:06:57,260 --> 01:06:57,270
a bit, well, well, let's go
 

1710
01:06:57,270 --> 01:07:01,770
a bit, well, well, let's go
with that feeling, that Hori

1711
01:07:01,770 --> 01:07:01,780
with that feeling, that Hori
 

1712
01:07:01,780 --> 01:07:03,739
with that feeling, that Hori

1713
01:07:03,739 --> 01:07:03,749

 

1714
01:07:03,749 --> 01:07:08,320

Hanjage is Fire Wire, the app is cheap,

1715
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:08,330
Hanjage is Fire Wire, the app is cheap,
 

1716
01:07:08,330 --> 01:07:14,860
Hanjage is Fire Wire, the app is cheap,
by the way, that's the first time I've been able to do it later.

1717
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:14,870
by the way, that's the first time I've been able to do it later.
 

1718
01:07:14,870 --> 01:07:16,690
by the way, that's the first time I've been able to do it later.
So it's an all-mighty. It

1719
01:07:16,690 --> 01:07:16,700
So it's an all-mighty. It
 

1720
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:19,780
So it's an all-mighty. It
has an offensive appeal.

1721
01:07:19,780 --> 01:07:19,790
has an offensive appeal.
 

1722
01:07:19,790 --> 01:07:23,520
has an offensive appeal.
For example, there is a

1723
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:23,530
For example, there is a
 

1724
01:07:23,530 --> 01:07:29,160
For example, there is a
character called Tsuyagari Mu who is an all-rounder who can use spirit arts without any problems while keeping those parts together.

1725
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:29,170
character called Tsuyagari Mu who is an all-rounder who can use spirit arts without any problems while keeping those parts together.
 

1726
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:31,800
character called Tsuyagari Mu who is an all-rounder who can use spirit arts without any problems while keeping those parts together.
He is a

1727
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:31,810
He is a
 

1728
01:07:31,810 --> 01:07:33,019
He is a

1729
01:07:33,019 --> 01:07:33,029

 

1730
01:07:33,029 --> 01:07:39,169

very fun character to get into. First of all, Aoraora is not just about attacking.

1731
01:07:39,169 --> 01:07:39,179
very fun character to get into. First of all, Aoraora is not just about attacking.
 

1732
01:07:39,179 --> 01:07:43,609
very fun character to get into. First of all, Aoraora is not just about attacking.
It's a long-distance character that can be enjoyed by playing like that,

1733
01:07:43,609 --> 01:07:43,619
It's a long-distance character that can be enjoyed by playing like that,
 

1734
01:07:43,619 --> 01:07:45,050
It's a long-distance character that can be enjoyed by playing like that,
so

1735
01:07:45,050 --> 01:07:45,060
so
 

1736
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:46,880
so
in that sense, if you

1737
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:46,890
in that sense, if you
 

1738
01:07:46,890 --> 01:07:51,789
in that sense, if you
have a little bit of a patrol month, you can try it out.

1739
01:07:51,789 --> 01:07:51,799
have a little bit of a patrol month, you can try it out.
 

1740
01:07:51,799 --> 01:07:55,730
have a little bit of a patrol month, you can try it out.
Also, it's a matter of luck and the margin of victory.  It's interesting. I

1741
01:07:55,730 --> 01:07:55,740
Also, it's a matter of luck and the margin of victory.  It's interesting. I
 

1742
01:07:55,740 --> 01:08:00,529
Also, it's a matter of luck and the margin of victory.  It's interesting. I
think so. There are a lot of characters that are like, "Yeah, that's right," but there are

1743
01:08:00,529 --> 01:08:05,710
think so. There are a lot of characters that are like, "Yeah, that's right," but there are
 

1744
01:08:05,710 --> 01:08:09,740

 

1745
01:08:09,740 --> 01:08:09,750

 

1746
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:16,650

also a lot of attacks that you can use just like that when you're standing there. Also, in this game, you don't just attack the target, but you can also use attacks like in the past.  That violent act,

1747
01:08:16,650 --> 01:08:16,660
also a lot of attacks that you can use just like that when you're standing there. Also, in this game, you don't just attack the target, but you can also use attacks like in the past.  That violent act,
 

1748
01:08:16,660 --> 01:08:19,430
also a lot of attacks that you can use just like that when you're standing there. Also, in this game, you don't just attack the target, but you can also use attacks like in the past.  That violent act,
that branch action that went to the center,

1749
01:08:19,430 --> 01:08:19,440
that branch action that went to the center,
 

1750
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:23,590
that branch action that went to the center,
is the focus of this time around evasion.

1751
01:08:23,590 --> 01:08:23,600
is the focus of this time around evasion.
 

1752
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:27,289
is the focus of this time around evasion.
So how to avoid the enemy's attacks

1753
01:08:27,289 --> 01:08:27,299
So how to avoid the enemy's attacks
 

1754
01:08:27,299 --> 01:08:30,160
So how to avoid the enemy's attacks
by taking the high road yourself,

1755
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:30,170
by taking the high road yourself,
 

1756
01:08:30,170 --> 01:08:31,320
by taking the high road yourself,
and

1757
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:31,330
and
 

1758
01:08:31,330 --> 01:08:32,740
and
then

1759
01:08:32,740 --> 01:08:32,750
then
 

1760
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:37,570
then
just by passing the evasion,  This feature allows you to close the distance between

1761
01:08:37,570 --> 01:08:37,580
just by passing the evasion,  This feature allows you to close the distance between
 

1762
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:38,630
just by passing the evasion,  This feature allows you to close the distance between
you and the enemy and

1763
01:08:38,630 --> 01:08:40,240
you and the enemy and
 

1764
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:40,250

 

1765
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:44,349

counterattack more easily, so

1766
01:08:44,349 --> 01:08:45,900
counterattack more easily, so
 

1767
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:45,910

 

1768
01:08:45,910 --> 01:08:48,750

please check it out.  The

1769
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:48,760
please check it out.  The
 

1770
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:53,320
please check it out.  The
performance is different, so I'd like you to try it out and see it.

1771
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:53,330
performance is different, so I'd like you to try it out and see it.
 

1772
01:08:53,330 --> 01:09:00,519
performance is different, so I'd like you to try it out and see it.
In this work that focuses on avoidance, only Kisara is standing, so she can receive and return attacks outside the workshop.

1773
01:09:00,519 --> 01:09:02,620
In this work that focuses on avoidance, only Kisara is standing, so she can receive and return attacks outside the workshop.
 

1774
01:09:02,620 --> 01:09:02,630

 

1775
01:09:02,630 --> 01:09:06,700

That's what makes her different from the other works.

1776
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:06,710
That's what makes her different from the other works.
 

1777
01:09:06,710 --> 01:09:07,700
That's what makes her different from the other works.

1778
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:07,710

 

1779
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:11,539

There are parts like that that stand out, so

1780
01:09:11,539 --> 01:09:11,549
There are parts like that that stand out, so
 

1781
01:09:11,549 --> 01:09:13,599
There are parts like that that stand out, so
Kisara is, I do

1782
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:13,609
Kisara is, I do
 

1783
01:09:13,609 --> 01:09:19,359
Kisara is, I do
n't know, I want to focus on attack, but I'd like to focus on defense a little more. Ah, the opponent school

1784
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:19,369
n't know, I want to focus on attack, but I'd like to focus on defense a little more. Ah, the opponent school
 

1785
01:09:19,369 --> 01:09:33,620
n't know, I want to focus on attack, but I'd like to focus on defense a little more. Ah, the opponent school
has a gay booby in the foreground, but, um, Nu.

1786
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:33,630
has a gay booby in the foreground, but, um, Nu.
 

1787
01:09:33,630 --> 01:09:37,400
has a gay booby in the foreground, but, um, Nu.
So even though they're really offensive characters,

1788
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:37,410
So even though they're really offensive characters,
 

1789
01:09:37,410 --> 01:09:42,050
So even though they're really offensive characters,
they each have their own charms.  If you really can't do this with fragments, there's also the character

1790
01:09:42,050 --> 01:09:42,060
they each have their own charms.  If you really can't do this with fragments, there's also the character
 

1791
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:45,120
they each have their own charms.  If you really can't do this with fragments, there's also the character
Law. To be

1792
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:45,130
Law. To be
 

1793
01:09:45,130 --> 01:09:46,210
Law. To be

1794
01:09:46,210 --> 01:09:46,220

 

1795
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:50,680

honest, I didn't try it much, but I think it

1796
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:50,690
honest, I didn't try it much, but I think it
 

1797
01:09:50,690 --> 01:09:57,010
honest, I didn't try it much, but I think it
was easy to do with the characters I tried out, except for Fen.  I

1798
01:09:57,010 --> 01:09:57,020
was easy to do with the characters I tried out, except for Fen.  I
 

1799
01:09:57,020 --> 01:10:04,270
was easy to do with the characters I tried out, except for Fen.  I
think it's Ninja-chan and Gizara-san who are using it. Knee-san's movements are

1800
01:10:04,270 --> 01:10:06,200
think it's Ninja-chan and Gizara-san who are using it. Knee-san's movements are
 

1801
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:06,210

 

1802
01:10:06,210 --> 01:10:12,650

a bit slow, but he's carrying all that equipment and a shield, so he's a bit heavy to move around.  There

1803
01:10:12,650 --> 01:10:33,920
a bit slow, but he's carrying all that equipment and a shield, so he's a bit heavy to move around.  There
 

1804
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,830

 

1805
01:10:35,830 --> 01:10:40,899

 

1806
01:10:40,899 --> 01:10:40,909

 

1807
01:10:40,909 --> 01:10:42,669

are various strategies for going inwards and facing the target.

1808
01:10:42,669 --> 01:10:42,679
are various strategies for going inwards and facing the target.
 

1809
01:10:42,679 --> 01:10:48,939
are various strategies for going inwards and facing the target.
That's right. With those 10 characters, you can keep your distance and heal at the same time,

1810
01:10:48,939 --> 01:10:48,949
That's right. With those 10 characters, you can keep your distance and heal at the same time,
 

1811
01:10:48,949 --> 01:10:52,000
That's right. With those 10 characters, you can keep your distance and heal at the same time,
so it has the

1812
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:52,010
so it has the
 

1813
01:10:52,010 --> 01:10:55,729
so it has the

1814
01:10:55,729 --> 01:10:55,739
feel of a school RPG with public characters,
 

1815
01:10:55,739 --> 01:11:00,620

but you can also attack when you're active, which is
 

1817
01:11:00,630 --> 01:11:01,129
but you can also attack when you're active, which is
nice.

1818
01:11:01,129 --> 01:11:01,139
nice.
 

1819

1822
01:11:08,580 --> 01:11:08,590
Toa's boost attack and Atako's boost attack were really
 

1823
01:11:08,590 --> 01:11:15,060
Toa's boost attack and Atako's boost attack were really
easy to do. I can do it over and over again with Bun Ibis, but if you

easy to do. I can do it over and over again with Bun Ibis, but if you
 

1825
01:11:15,070 --> 01:11:25,890
easy to do. I can do it over and over again with Bun Ibis, but if you
combine them, the battle becomes a lot more open.  That Tan

asked him to record it, and well, it's been 7 years, and the game wasn't even finished at that time. Yes, it was quite difficult, but as I started shooting around that time, the game gradually came together, and I started to think, well, I want to reassess it.  I made a scene like this, so I want to shoot some more.

asked him to record it, and well, it's been 7 years, and the game wasn't even finished at that time.

asked him to record it, and well, it's been 7 years, and the game wasn't even finished at that time. Yes, it was quite difficult, but as I started shooting around that time, the game gradually came together, and I started to think, well, I want to reassess it.  I made a scene like this, so I want to shoot some more.

1901
01:14:33,710 --> 01:14:33,720

1905
01:14:39,210 --> 01:14:42,920

It's a big worry for me as a creator. If it were real, I'd finish shooting all at once. In a

1906
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:44,910
It's a big worry for me as a creator. If it were real, I'd finish shooting all at once. In a
 

1907
01:14:44,910 --> 01:14:44,920

 

1908
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:47,939

normal game, that would be the right thing to do.  But

1909
01:14:47,939 --> 01:14:47,949
normal game, that would be the right thing to do.  But
 

1910
01:14:47,949 --> 01:14:50,120
normal game, that would be the right thing to do.  But
in the case of Teruzo-bu, it's

1911
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:50,130
in the case of Teruzo-bu, it's
 

1912
01:14:50,130 --> 01:14:54,709
in the case of Teruzo-bu, it's
really the skits and short chats that I mentioned earlier, and

1913
01:14:54,709 --> 01:14:54,719
really the skits and short chats that I mentioned earlier, and
 

1914
01:14:54,719 --> 01:14:59,250
really the skits and short chats that I mentioned earlier, and
once the scene is complete, the voices and

1915
01:14:59,250 --> 01:14:59,260
once the scene is complete, the voices and
 

1916
01:14:59,260 --> 01:15:04,319
once the scene is complete, the voices and
emotions of the characters are really needed.  Every time, something is

1917
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:04,329
emotions of the characters are really needed.  Every time, something is
 

1918
01:15:04,329 --> 01:15:06,900
emotions of the characters are really needed.  Every time, something is
born one after another.

1919
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:08,419
born one after another.
 

1920
01:15:08,419 --> 01:15:08,429

 

1921
01:15:08,429 --> 01:15:14,509

Yes, that's true, but we need to make the game as quickly as possible, and we

1922
01:15:14,509 --> 01:15:14,519
Yes, that's true, but we need to make the game as quickly as possible, and we
 

1923
01:15:14,519 --> 01:15:19,310
Yes, that's true, but we need to make the game as quickly as possible, and we
need to get the voice actors to start making it interesting.

1924
01:15:19,310 --> 01:15:19,320
need to get the voice actors to start making it interesting.
 

1925
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:22,939
need to get the voice actors to start making it interesting.
So I always think that we need to start early.  But it's

1926
01:15:22,939 --> 01:15:22,949
So I always think that we need to start early.  But it's
 

1927
01:15:22,949 --> 01:15:28,410
So I always think that we need to start early.  But it's
not over yet, and the

1928
01:15:28,410 --> 01:15:28,420
not over yet, and the
 

1929
01:15:28,420 --> 01:15:34,709
not over yet, and the
recording itself was already completed about two years ago, so it's a

1930
01:15:34,709 --> 01:15:34,719
recording itself was already completed about two years ago, so it's a
 

1931
01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:36,390
recording itself was already completed about two years ago, so it's a
big deal.  The

1932
01:15:36,390 --> 01:15:36,400
big deal.  The
 

1933
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:41,729
big deal.  The
promotion has started and I've been appearing on TV shows a

1934
01:15:41,729 --> 01:15:43,570
promotion has started and I've been appearing on TV shows a
 

1935
01:15:43,570 --> 01:15:50,590

 

1936
01:15:50,590 --> 01:15:51,190

 

1937
01:15:51,190 --> 01:15:51,200

 

1938
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:53,720

lot, so I'll start by apologizing for the wait.  When you

1939
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:53,730
lot, so I'll start by apologizing for the wait.  When you
 

1940
01:15:53,730 --> 01:16:01,600
lot, so I'll start by apologizing for the wait.  When you
play this game, you can enjoy the feeling that our acting has come together as one true character, and that two

1941
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:01,610
play this game, you can enjoy the feeling that our acting has come together as one true character, and that two
 

1942
01:16:01,610 --> 01:16:07,180
play this game, you can enjoy the feeling that our acting has come together as one true character, and that two
characters are really there.

1943
01:16:07,180 --> 01:16:08,850
characters are really there.
 

1944
01:16:08,850 --> 01:16:08,860

 

1945
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:10,050

1948
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:16,070

Recently, I've been playing her in the 5 Promotion and things like that, and I've been

Recently, I've been playing her in the 5 Promotion and things like that, and I've been

01:16:18,870 --> 01:16:18,880

 

1951
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:23,250

feeling a deep emotion while I'm doing it, but that's all I can say about the

1952
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:23,260
feeling a deep emotion while I'm doing it, but that's all I can say about the
 

1953
01:16:23,260 --> 01:16:25,720
feeling a deep emotion while I'm doing it, but that's all I can say about the
passionate acting that's

1954
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:29,330
passionate acting that's
 

1955
01:16:29,330 --> 01:16:29,340

 

1956
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:33,050

present in her voice, especially in Japanese.  So, I would like to

1957
01:16:33,050 --> 01:16:36,320
present in her voice, especially in Japanese.  So, I would like to
 

1958
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:36,330

1961
01:16:42,810 --> 01:16:47,870
convey the correct fashion to the voice actors of Manabu Sakano, and if
there is something close to it, I would like to surpass it.

2002
01:18:14,139 --> 01:18:21,959
There are a lot of really delicate steps. It was
really hard to do this for the release of the Prince.

01:27:53,990 --> 01:28:01,000
easy to understand, so through that
I want to draw attention to the more complex human mind and things like that.  I also

2254
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:01,010
I want to draw attention to the more complex human mind and things like that.  I also
 

2255
01:28:01,010 --> 01:28:03,980
I want to draw attention to the more complex human mind and things like that.  I also
had one more thing to say.

2256
01:28:03,980 --> 01:28:03,990
had one more thing to say.
 

2257
01:28:03,990 --> 01:28:08,510
had one more thing to say.
This time, the characters will be 3D, and I

2258
01:28:08,510 --> 01:28:08,520
This time, the characters will be 3D, and I
 

2259
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:14,790
This time, the characters will be 3D, and I
think that the investment trust will increase and the characters will become more realistic.  The

2260
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:14,800
think that the investment trust will increase and the characters will become more realistic.  The
 

2261
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:20,580
think that the investment trust will increase and the characters will become more realistic.  The
worries and comments of the characters, and the

2262
01:28:20,580 --> 01:28:20,590
worries and comments of the characters, and the
 

2263
01:28:20,590 --> 01:28:23,400
worries and comments of the characters, and the
relationships between the characters, have a certain

2264
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:23,410
relationships between the characters, have a certain
 

2265
01:28:23,410 --> 01:28:28,680
relationships between the characters, have a certain
realism and a higher level of perceptual effect.

2266
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:30,600
realism and a higher level of perceptual effect.
 

2267
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:33,280

 

2268
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:36,870

 

2269
01:28:36,870 --> 01:28:36,880

 

2270
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:38,370


2271
01:28:38,370 --> 01:28:40,800

 

2272
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:42,420

 

2273
01:28:42,420 --> 01:28:42,430

 

2274
01:28:42,430 --> 01:28:45,930

In that sense, in order to express the real worries of the characters in a world that changes in an easy-to-understand way, I

2275
01:28:45,930 --> 01:28:53,050
In that sense, in order to express the real worries of the characters in a world that changes in an easy-to-understand way, I
 

2276
01:28:53,050 --> 01:28:55,860

 

2277
01:28:55,860 --> 01:28:55,870

 

2278
01:28:55,870 --> 01:29:01,110

tried to use a simple structure.

2279
01:29:01,110 --> 01:29:01,120
tried to use a simple structure.
 

2280
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:06,900
tried to use a simple structure.
So, in terms of the differences with other works, it's a little difficult to explain,

2281
01:29:06,900 --> 01:29:06,910
So, in terms of the differences with other works, it's a little difficult to explain,
 

2282
01:29:06,910 --> 01:29:08,120
So, in terms of the differences with other works, it's a little difficult to explain,
but with

2283
01:29:08,120 --> 01:29:08,130
but with
 

2284
01:29:08,130 --> 01:29:14,740
but with
that feeling in mind, I decided to face the conflict structure that is the path of this series.

2285
01:29:14,740 --> 01:29:18,740
that feeling in mind, I decided to face the conflict structure that is the path of this series.
 

2286
01:29:18,740 --> 01:29:18,750

 

2287
01:29:18,750 --> 01:29:22,880

That's how it feels.

2288
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:22,890
That's how it feels.
 

2289
01:29:22,890 --> 01:29:27,320
That's how it feels.
Thank you for your hard work.  I

2290
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:27,330
Thank you for your hard work.  I
 

2291
01:29:27,330 --> 01:29:36,050
Thank you for your hard work.  I
have a question I want to ask, and I think it might be the last one. The

2292
01:29:36,050 --> 01:29:36,060
have a question I want to ask, and I think it might be the last one. The
 

2293
01:29:36,060 --> 01:29:38,730
have a question I want to ask, and I think it might be the last one. The
video is about to be released, but now that it's

2294
01:29:38,730 --> 01:29:38,740
video is about to be released, but now that it's
 

2295
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:43,320
video is about to be released, but now that it's
so close,

2296
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:43,330
so close,
 

2297
01:29:43,330 --> 01:29:47,070
so close,
how do you feel about it? Do you have any thoughts about whether you've achieved it or not?

2298
01:29:47,070 --> 01:29:47,080
how do you feel about it? Do you have any thoughts about whether you've achieved it or not?
 

2299
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:53,850
how do you feel about it? Do you have any thoughts about whether you've achieved it or not?
Yes, it

2300
01:29:53,850 --> 01:29:53,860

 

2301
01:29:53,860 --> 01:30:00,300

has been a long time since we started planning it at the end of 2016, and we've just started to sink in,

2302
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:00,310
has been a long time since we started planning it at the end of 2016, and we've just started to sink in,
 

2303
01:30:00,310 --> 01:30:02,900
has been a long time since we started planning it at the end of 2016, and we've just started to sink in,
so

2304
01:30:02,900 --> 01:30:02,910
so
 

2305
01:30:02,910 --> 01:30:07,790
so
thanks to that, the gamers are almost done, so I'm

2306
01:30:07,790 --> 01:30:07,800
thanks to that, the gamers are almost done, so I'm
 

2307
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:10,640
thanks to that, the gamers are almost done, so I'm

2308
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:10,650

 

2309
01:30:10,650 --> 01:30:14,120

half looking forward to seeing how everyone responds.

2310
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:14,130
half looking forward to seeing how everyone responds.
 

2311
01:30:14,130 --> 01:30:19,160
half looking forward to seeing how everyone responds.
There are many challenges ahead, so I am

2312
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:20,270
There are many challenges ahead, so I am
 

2313
01:30:20,270 --> 01:30:20,280

 

2314
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:24,020

half nervous about the reactions, but

2315
01:30:24,020 --> 01:30:27,740
half nervous about the reactions, but
 

2316
01:30:27,740 --> 01:30:27,750

 

2317
01:30:27,750 --> 01:30:31,850

as I have said before, I am also grateful for this opportunity to be with people from all over the world.

2318
01:30:31,850 --> 01:30:36,720
as I have said before, I am also grateful for this opportunity to be with people from all over the world.
 

2319

2320
01:30:36,730 --> 01:30:43,220

That was one of the goals I aimed for this time, so I

2321
01:30:43,220 --> 01:30:43,230
That was one of the goals I aimed for this time, so I
 

2322
01:30:43,230 --> 01:30:47,210
That was one of the goals I aimed for this time, so I
think it would be good to know what kind of reactions there are,

2323
01:30:47,210 --> 01:30:47,220
think it would be good to know what kind of reactions there are,
 

2324
01:30:47,220 --> 01:30:51,050
think it would be good to know what kind of reactions there are,
but I just want to know about it.  It's something that everyone can enjoy at the same time around the world. It's

2325
01:30:51,050 --> 01:30:52,940
but I just want to know about it.  It's something that everyone can enjoy at the same time around the world. It's
 

2326
01:30:52,940 --> 01:30:57,950

 

2327
01:30:57,950 --> 01:30:57,960

 

2328
01:30:57,960 --> 01:31:00,950

fine for people to post comments on social media like, "That part was good," or "That character was good," or there are all kinds of reactions, like, "

2329
01:31:00,950 --> 01:31:00,960
fine for people to post comments on social media like, "That part was good," or "That character was good," or there are all kinds of reactions, like, "
 

2330
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:06,020
fine for people to post comments on social media like, "That part was good," or "That character was good," or there are all kinds of reactions, like, "
This game design was good," or "That didn't suit me."

2331
01:31:06,020 --> 01:31:06,030
This game design was good," or "That didn't suit me."
 

2332
01:31:06,030 --> 01:31:11,840
This game design was good," or "That didn't suit me."
But I think it's important that things like this happen all around the world at the same time, and I'm

2333
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:12,960
But I think it's important that things like this happen all around the world at the same time, and I'm

2335
01:31:12,970 --> 01:31:18,470

really excited that we're able to make it happen.

2336
01:31:18,470 --> 01:31:18,480
really excited that we're able to make it happen.
 

2337

01:31:29,070 --> 01:31:34,910

but on the other hand, I'm really nervous, so I'll just crawl into bed and

2345
01:31:34,910 --> 01:31:34,920
but on the other hand, I'm really nervous, so I'll just crawl into bed and
 

2346
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:38,310
but on the other hand, I'm really nervous, so I'll just crawl into bed and
wrap myself in my futon.  I've been looking at it for a long time,

wrap myself in my futon.  I've been looking at it for a long time,

01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:39,080
that.  I'm
really happy to be able to walk this path. And

2403
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:39,090
really happy to be able to walk this path. And
 

2404
01:33:39,090 --> 01:33:43,609
really happy to be able to walk this path. And
as I said before, through this Arise, even if there

2405
01:33:43,609 --> 01:33:43,619
as I said before, through this Arise, even if there
 

2406
01:33:43,619 --> 01:33:48,609
as I said before, through this Arise, even if there
are people who are really new to the club, I think that the number of people who are just stones will just increase.

2407
01:33:48,609 --> 01:33:48,619
are people who are really new to the club, I think that the number of people who are just stones will just increase.
 

2408
01:33:48,619 --> 01:33:50,339
are people who are really new to the club, I think that the number of people who are just stones will just increase.
So I

2409
01:33:50,339 --> 01:33:54,179

2410
01:33:54,179 --> 01:33:54,189

 

2411
01:33:54,189 --> 01:33:58,859

think that there are a lot of people who are really fans of Chiara but didn't know about Teruzu and found out about it through this show, and I

2412
01:33:58,859 --> 01:33:58,869
think that there are a lot of people who are really fans of Chiara but didn't know about Teruzu and found out about it through this show, and I

01:33:58,869 --> 01:34:03,090

2415
01:34:03,100 --> 01:34:06,510
really
hope that those people will give it a try.  We all got

01:34:06,510 --> 01:34:06,520
hope that those people will give it a try.  We all got
 

2417
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:10,950
hope that those people will give it a try.  We all got
excited together and played the game like it was on a TV show.  I

2418
01:34:10,950 --> 01:34:10,960
excited together and played the game like it was on a TV show.  I
