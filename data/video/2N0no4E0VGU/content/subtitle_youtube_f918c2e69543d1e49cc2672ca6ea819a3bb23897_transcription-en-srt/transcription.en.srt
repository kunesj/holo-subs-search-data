1366
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:41,400
but I think it's just that two years ago
 

1367
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,829
but I think it's just that two years ago
um

1368
00:39:42,829 --> 00:39:42,839
um
 

1369
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:46,190
um
the amount of [\h__\h]

1370
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:46,200
the amount of [\h__\h]
 

1371
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,589
the amount of [\h__\h]
that I was getting was just so

1372
00:39:48,589 --> 00:39:48,599
that I was getting was just so
 

1373
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:49,970
that I was getting was just so
overwhelming

1374
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:49,980
overwhelming
 

1375
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:52,970
overwhelming
there was like no way from for me to

1376
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:52,980
there was like no way from for me to
 

1377
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,530
there was like no way from for me to
even Escape it

1378
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:54,540
even Escape it
 

1379
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:57,890
even Escape it
and it was just so much so the sheer

1380
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:57,900
and it was just so much so the sheer
 

1381
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,609
and it was just so much so the sheer
amount of it

1382
00:40:00,609 --> 00:40:00,619
amount of it
 

1383
00:40:00,619 --> 00:40:05,390
amount of it
was just unbearable

1384
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:05,400

 

1385
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:09,130

so that's probably

1386
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:09,140
so that's probably
 

1387
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:12,470
so that's probably
the difference

1388
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:12,480

 

1389
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,230

and then I had to borrow money

2084
00:59:58,130 --> 00:59:58,140
and then I had to borrow money
 

2085
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:00,710
and then I had to borrow money
to get a new flight for the next day

2086
01:00:00,710 --> 01:00:00,720
to get a new flight for the next day
 

2087
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:04,130
