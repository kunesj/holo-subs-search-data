but the question is does the flow go to

1212
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:02,400
but the question is does the flow go to
 

1213
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,390
but the question is does the flow go to
the right side here

1214
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:04,400
the right side here
 

1215
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,230
the right side here
or to the left side if it goes to the

1216
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:06,240
or to the left side if it goes to the
 

1217
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,990
or to the left side if it goes to the
right side i'll go here and then i can

1218
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:08,000
right side i'll go here and then i can
 

1219
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,470
right side i'll go here and then i can
try to go straight down from here

1220
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:10,480
try to go straight down from here
 

1221
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,390
try to go straight down from here
and then left

1222
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:12,400
and then left
 

1223
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,310
and then left
and down

1224
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:14,320
and down
 

1225
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,109
and down
but if i if if the flow goes left safe

1226
00:35:17,109 --> 00:35:17,119
but if i if if the flow goes left safe
 

1227

more dialogue would have been cool
 

19329
09:02:36,958 --> 09:02:39,430
more dialogue would have been cool
but no that's it's not really an issue

19330
09:02:39,430 --> 09:02:39,440
but no that's it's not really an issue
 

19331
09:02:39,440 --> 09:02:40,468
but no that's it's not really an issue
either

19332
09:02:40,468 --> 09:02:40,478
either
 

19333
09:02:40,478 --> 09:02:44,070
either
um the dungeons were um

19334
09:02:44,070 --> 09:02:44,080
um the dungeons were um
 

19335
09:02:44,080 --> 09:02:46,388
um the dungeons were um
they looked so much more difficult when

19336
09:02:46,388 --> 09:02:46,398
they looked so much more difficult when
 

19337
09:02:46,398 --> 09:02:48,708
they looked so much more difficult when
i watched someone else play it but by

19338
09:02:48,708 --> 09:02:48,718
i watched someone else play it but by
 

19339
09:02:48,718 --> 09:02:52,070
i watched someone else play it but by
playing it by myself it was actually

19340
09:02:52,070 --> 09:02:52,080
playing it by myself it was actually
 

19341
09:02:52,080 --> 09:02:54,308
playing it by myself it was actually
challenging here and there had to think

19342
09:02:54,308 --> 09:02:54,318
challenging here and there had to think
 

19343
09:02:54,318 --> 09:02:55,270
challenging here and there had to think
about

19344
09:02:55,270 --> 09:02:55,280
about
 

19345
09:02:55,280 --> 09:02:58,468
about
where to go a lot like it was the

19346
09:02:58,468 --> 09:02:58,478
where to go a lot like it was the
 

19347
09:02:58,478 --> 09:03:01,590
where to go a lot like it was the
opposite of linear

19348
09:03:01,590 --> 09:03:01,600
opposite of linear
 

19349
09:03:01,600 --> 09:03:03,110
opposite of linear
i guess

19350
09:03:03,110 --> 09:03:03,120
i guess
 

19351
09:03:03,120 --> 09:03:04,388
i guess
uh

19352
09:03:04,388 --> 09:03:04,398
uh
 

19353
09:03:04,398 --> 09:03:06,868
uh
what do you call it like it was like go

19354
09:03:06,868 --> 09:03:06,878
what do you call it like it was like go
 

19355
09:03:06,878 --> 09:03:08,868
what do you call it like it was like go
here go there go back then go here it

19356
09:03:08,868 --> 09:03:08,878
here go there go back then go here it
 

19357
09:03:08,878 --> 09:03:10,708
here go there go back then go here it
was very confusing it was like a like a

19358
09:03:10,708 --> 09:03:10,718
was very confusing it was like a like a
 

19359
09:03:10,718 --> 09:03:13,670
was very confusing it was like a like a
knot of cables you know how under your

19360
09:03:13,670 --> 09:03:13,680
knot of cables you know how under your
 

19361
09:03:13,680 --> 09:03:16,070
knot of cables you know how under your
desk you have a [\h__\h] ton of cables

19362
09:03:16,070 --> 09:03:16,080
desk you have a [\h__\h] ton of cables
 

19363
09:03:16,080 --> 09:03:18,548
desk you have a [\h__\h] ton of cables
and they're like you don't know

19364
09:03:18,548 --> 09:03:18,558
and they're like you don't know
 

19365
09:03:18,558 --> 09:03:20,868
and they're like you don't know
which one goes where

19366
09:03:20,868 --> 09:03:20,878
which one goes where
 

19367
09:03:20,878 --> 09:03:23,270
which one goes where
that's how the dungeons felt

19368
09:03:23,270 --> 09:03:23,280
that's how the dungeons felt
 

19369
09:03:23,280 --> 09:03:25,350
that's how the dungeons felt
that's a good thing like i hear people

19370
09:03:25,350 --> 09:03:25,360
that's a good thing like i hear people
 

19371
09:03:25,360 --> 09:03:29,270
that's a good thing like i hear people
um i guess when it comes to like pokemon

19372
09:03:29,270 --> 09:03:29,280
um i guess when it comes to like pokemon
 

19373
09:03:29,280 --> 09:03:31,190
um i guess when it comes to like pokemon
maps as well like the pokemon worlds

19374
09:03:31,190 --> 09:03:31,200
maps as well like the pokemon worlds
 

19375
09:03:31,200 --> 09:03:33,270
maps as well like the pokemon worlds
like i i heard that there's quite some

19376
09:03:33,270 --> 09:03:33,280
like i i heard that there's quite some
 

19377
09:03:33,280 --> 09:03:36,230
like i i heard that there's quite some
evolution there like older pokemon games

19378
09:03:36,230 --> 09:03:36,240
evolution there like older pokemon games
 

19379
09:03:36,240 --> 09:03:39,830
evolution there like older pokemon games
didn't uh were not as linear as they are

19380
09:03:39,830 --> 09:03:39,840
didn't uh were not as linear as they are
 

19381
09:03:39,840 --> 09:03:41,350
didn't uh were not as linear as they are
now like for example sword and shield

19382
09:03:41,350 --> 09:03:41,360
now like for example sword and shield
 

19383
09:03:41,360 --> 09:03:43,430
now like for example sword and shield
where it just goes from bottom to top

19384
09:03:43,430 --> 09:03:43,440
where it just goes from bottom to top
 

19385
09:03:43,440 --> 09:03:45,190
where it just goes from bottom to top
and then in other words it's like yeah

19386
09:03:45,190 --> 09:03:45,200
and then in other words it's like yeah
 

19387
09:03:45,200 --> 09:03:47,350
and then in other words it's like yeah
go there or go there go there go there

19388
09:03:47,350 --> 09:03:47,360
go there or go there go there go there
 

19389
09:03:47,360 --> 09:03:49,830
go there or go there go there go there
yeah um i guess

19390
09:03:49,830 --> 09:03:49,840
yeah um i guess
 

19391
09:03:49,840 --> 09:03:52,230
yeah um i guess
in zelda games like if i compare this to

19392
09:03:52,230 --> 09:03:52,240
in zelda games like if i compare this to
 

19393
09:03:52,240 --> 09:03:53,670
in zelda games like if i compare this to
skyward sword

19394
09:03:53,670 --> 09:03:53,680
skyward sword
 

19395
09:03:53,680 --> 09:03:56,070
skyward sword
uh dungeons i mean you can't compare it

19396
09:03:56,070 --> 09:03:56,080
uh dungeons i mean you can't compare it
 

19397
09:03:56,080 --> 09:03:57,590
uh dungeons i mean you can't compare it
you can't really compare it it's like a

19398
09:03:57,590 --> 09:03:57,600
you can't really compare it it's like a
 

19399
09:03:57,600 --> 09:03:59,590
you can't really compare it it's like a
completely different format

19400
09:03:59,590 --> 09:03:59,600
completely different format
 

19401
09:03:59,600 --> 09:04:00,948
completely different format
but this

19402
09:04:00,948 --> 09:04:00,958
but this
 

19403
09:04:00,958 --> 09:04:03,590
but this
the dungeons here felt

19404
09:04:03,590 --> 09:04:03,600
the dungeons here felt
 

19405
09:04:03,600 --> 09:04:04,708
the dungeons here felt
way more

19406
09:04:04,708 --> 09:04:04,718
way more
 

19407
09:04:04,718 --> 09:04:07,910
way more
confusing in not a bad way but like

19408
09:04:07,910 --> 09:04:07,920
confusing in not a bad way but like
 

19409
09:04:07,920 --> 09:04:10,388
confusing in not a bad way but like
skyward sword in skyward sword it felt

19410
09:04:10,388 --> 09:04:10,398
skyward sword in skyward sword it felt
 

19411
09:04:10,398 --> 09:04:11,670
skyward sword in skyward sword it felt
clearer

19412
09:04:11,670 --> 09:04:11,680
clearer
 

19413
09:04:11,680 --> 09:04:14,308
clearer
on where to go and what to do

19414
09:04:14,308 --> 09:04:14,318
on where to go and what to do
 

19415
09:04:14,318 --> 09:04:18,308
on where to go and what to do
than in this dungeon stuff i think i

19416
09:04:18,308 --> 09:04:18,318
than in this dungeon stuff i think i
 

19417
09:04:18,318 --> 09:04:20,788
than in this dungeon stuff i think i
think so but yeah i mean as i said can't

19418
09:04:20,788 --> 09:04:20,798
think so but yeah i mean as i said can't
 

19419
09:04:20,798 --> 09:04:22,548
think so but yeah i mean as i said can't
really compare

19420
09:04:22,548 --> 09:04:22,558
really compare
 

19421
09:04:22,558 --> 09:04:24,308
really compare
2d for the yeah

19422
09:04:24,308 --> 09:04:24,318
2d for the yeah
 

19423
09:04:24,318 --> 09:04:26,150
2d for the yeah
and the perspective and all that the

19424
09:04:26,150 --> 09:04:26,160
and the perspective and all that the
 

19425
09:04:26,160 --> 09:04:28,708
and the perspective and all that the
perspective changes it a lot too like i

19426
09:04:28,708 --> 09:04:28,718
perspective changes it a lot too like i
 

19427
09:04:28,718 --> 09:04:29,590
perspective changes it a lot too like i
think

19428
09:04:29,590 --> 09:04:29,600
think
 

19429
09:04:29,600 --> 09:04:31,110
think
if you were to

19430
09:04:31,110 --> 09:04:31,120
if you were to
 

19431
09:04:31,120 --> 09:04:33,190
if you were to
have these dungeons in 3d it would be a

19432
09:04:33,190 --> 09:04:33,200
have these dungeons in 3d it would be a
 

19433
09:04:33,200 --> 09:04:35,270
have these dungeons in 3d it would be a
whole different experience and 3d i mean

19434
09:04:35,270 --> 09:04:35,280
whole different experience and 3d i mean
 

19435
09:04:35,280 --> 09:04:37,990
whole different experience and 3d i mean
like like a skyward sword ex uh

19436
09:04:37,990 --> 09:04:38,000
like like a skyward sword ex uh
 

19437
09:04:38,000 --> 09:04:40,468
like like a skyward sword ex uh
uh perspective like maybe like an fps

19438
09:04:40,468 --> 09:04:40,478
uh perspective like maybe like an fps
 

19439
09:04:40,478 --> 09:04:42,308
uh perspective like maybe like an fps
expec uh perspective

19440
09:04:42,308 --> 09:04:42,318
expec uh perspective
 

19441
09:04:42,318 --> 09:04:43,830
expec uh perspective
that would probably be

19442
09:04:43,830 --> 09:04:43,840
that would probably be
 

19443
09:04:43,840 --> 09:04:45,750
that would probably be
a whole different

19444
09:04:45,750 --> 09:04:45,760
a whole different
 

19445
09:04:45,760 --> 09:04:48,468
a whole different
thing to deal with

19446
09:04:48,468 --> 09:04:48,478
thing to deal with
 

19447
09:04:48,478 --> 09:04:50,468
thing to deal with
yeah

19448
09:04:50,468 --> 09:04:50,478
yeah
 

19449
09:04:50,478 --> 09:04:52,230
