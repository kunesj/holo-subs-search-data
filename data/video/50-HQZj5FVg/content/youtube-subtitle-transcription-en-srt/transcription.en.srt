watching it develop but you know what
 

4325
01:51:52,020 --> 01:51:57,470
watching it develop but you know what
you could do in theory oh in theory

4326
01:51:57,470 --> 01:51:57,480
you could do in theory oh in theory
 

4327
01:51:57,480 --> 01:52:01,010
you could do in theory oh in theory
so the I think you could for example try

4328

so the I think you could for example try
 

4329
01:52:01,020 --> 01:52:04,910

to build the path oh
 

4331
01:52:04,920 --> 01:52:07,970
to build the path oh

02:04:16,320 --> 02:04:17,589
that's when I started the renovations
actually

4838
02:04:17,589 --> 02:04:17,599
actually
 

4839
02:04:17,599 --> 02:04:20,870
actually
oh that's that's definitely not natural

4840
02:04:20,870 --> 02:04:20,880
oh that's that's definitely not natural
 

4841

oh that's that's definitely not natural
but in the future you will you will have

4842
02:04:22,790 --> 02:04:22,800
but in the future you will you will have
 

4843
02:04:22,800 --> 02:04:24,709
but in the future you will you will have
an eye for that in the future I'm sure

4844
02:04:24,709 --> 02:04:24,719
an eye for that in the future I'm sure
 

4845

02:04:50,270 --> 02:04:50,280
and then there's stone tools then
 

4863
02:04:50,280 --> 02:04:52,550
and then there's stone tools then
there's iron tools in that order that's

4864

there's iron tools in that order that's
 

4865
02:04:52,560 --> 02:04:54,830
there's iron tools in that order that's
how they get better iron tools and then

4866
02:04:54,830 --> 02:04:54,840
how they get better iron tools and then
 

4867
02:04:54,840 --> 02:04:58,609
how they get better iron tools and then
diamond tools right and then you can all

4868
02:04:58,609 --> 02:04:58,619
diamond tools right and then you can all
 

4869
02:04:58,619 --> 02:05:02,390
diamond tools right and then you can all
build them with uh wood and the the

4870
02:05:02,390 --> 02:05:02,400
build them with uh wood and the the
 

4871
02:05:02,400 --> 02:05:06,350
build them with uh wood and the the
material like diamond board iron and so

4872
02:05:06,350 --> 02:05:06,360
material like diamond board iron and so

we can place it uh
I would say

7552
03:09:52,870 --> 03:09:52,880
I would say
 

7553
03:09:52,880 --> 03:09:56,389
I would say
well here is not really enough space so

7554
03:09:56,389 --> 03:09:56,399
well here is not really enough space so
 

7555
03:09:56,399 --> 03:10:00,110
well here is not really enough space so
I guess it should be at the bottom

7556

and
 

7591
03:10:41,819 --> 03:10:42,710
and
um

7592
03:10:42,710 --> 03:10:42,720
um
 

7593
03:10:42,720 --> 03:10:47,570
um
um with those sticks each one has a each

7594
03:10:47,570 --> 03:10:47,580
um with those sticks each one has a each
 

7595

it and then you take the I think we can
 

7601
03:10:54,540 --> 03:10:56,570
it and then you take the I think we can
even just make it as simple as

7602
03:10:56,570 --> 03:10:56,580
even just make it as simple as
 

7603
