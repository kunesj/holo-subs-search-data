are a lot of members from overseas, so I'd like
 

130
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,510
are a lot of members from overseas, so I'd like
someone who doesn't understand Japanese kanji to choose it.Ok

someone who doesn't understand Japanese kanji to choose it.Ok

00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:38,329

Inanis was also amazing. I

425
00:13:38,329 --> 00:13:38,339
Inanis was also amazing. I
 

426
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:39,949
Inanis was also amazing. I
had the impression that I could understand kanji, but

427
00:13:39,949 --> 00:13:39,959
had the impression that I could understand kanji, but
 

428
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:41,810
had the impression that I could understand kanji, but
surprisingly, not everyone knows about flowers.

429
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:41,820
surprisingly, not everyone knows about flowers.
 

430
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,410
surprisingly, not everyone knows about flowers.
Well, it's probably this flower.

431
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:44,420
Well, it's probably this flower.
 

432
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:48,769
Well, it's probably this flower.
I don't know much about it, so I didn't understand it. That's

433
00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:48,779
I don't know much about it, so I didn't understand it. That's
 

434
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:51,530
I don't know much about it, so I didn't understand it. That's
true, even at the level

435
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:51,540
true, even at the level
 

436
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:55,850
true, even at the level
of the captain.  Reine is the

437
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:55,860
of the captain.  Reine is the
 

438
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:59,629
of the captain.  Reine is the
best overseas member of Hololive in speaking Japanese. I'm so

439
00:13:59,629 --> 00:13:59,639
best overseas member of Hololive in speaking Japanese. I'm so
 

440
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,690
best overseas member of Hololive in speaking Japanese. I'm so
happy that even in that lane, I don't understand her

441
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:02,700
happy that even in that lane, I don't understand her
 

442
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,509
happy that even in that lane, I don't understand her
. She speaks like that.

443
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:05,519
. She speaks like that.
 

444
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,449
. She speaks like that.
The power she speaks has nothing to do with the power she feels.  It's

445
00:14:08,449 --> 00:14:08,459
The power she speaks has nothing to do with the power she feels.  It's
 

446
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:12,590
The power she speaks has nothing to do with the power she feels.  It's
completely different, I see.If you

447
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:12,600
completely different, I see.If you
 

448
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,690
completely different, I see.If you
don't study kanji at all even if you talk a lot.There

00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:32,629
san.  That's right, Anya, who is
doing this, speaks a lot of Japanese.

462
00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:32,639

 

463
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,210

JP speaks a lot, so I
