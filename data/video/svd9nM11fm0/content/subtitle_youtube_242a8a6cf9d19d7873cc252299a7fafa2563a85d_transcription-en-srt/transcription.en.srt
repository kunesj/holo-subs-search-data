10518
04:58:27,280 --> 04:58:29,948
I think he's been since in a wheelchair
cuz he did like a crazy flip in on a on

before and Iris was supposed to be there
 

13347
06:15:53,000 --> 06:15:55,708
before and Iris was supposed to be there
too but I guess traffic was really bad

13348
06:15:55,708 --> 06:15:55,718
too but I guess traffic was really bad
 

13349
06:15:55,718 --> 06:15:59,548
too but I guess traffic was really bad
so she showed up when we were like done

13350
06:15:59,548 --> 06:15:59,558
