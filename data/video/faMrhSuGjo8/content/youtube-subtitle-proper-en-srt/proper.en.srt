1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,485
​​​ ​A snail!​ ​​

2
00:00:01,485 --> 00:00:01,919
​​​ ​Oh no.​ ​​

3
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:02,553
​​​ ​Ah, crud.​ ​​

4
00:00:02,553 --> 00:00:03,721
​​​ ​This is bad.​ ​​

5
00:00:03,721 --> 00:00:05,222
​​​ ​Just simply giving you snacks would...​ ​​

6
00:00:04,989 --> 00:00:05,089
​​<i>​ ​​​ ​</i>​

7
00:00:05,222 --> 00:00:06,824
​​​ ​I'm not <i>that </i>cheap!​ ​​

8
00:00:08,158 --> 00:00:08,959
​​​ ​Hey!​ ​​

9
00:00:08,959 --> 00:00:10,461
​​​ ​It's starting!​ ​​

10
00:00:10,461 --> 00:00:13,063
​​​ ​Welcome to holo's Bonjour.​ ​​

11
00:00:13,063 --> 00:00:17,034
​​​ ​This is the official hololive variety and talk show​ ​​

12
00:00:17,034 --> 00:00:21,205
​​​ ​which changes out​ ​​
​​ ​one of the guests every month!​ ​​

13
00:00:21,638 --> 00:00:23,207
​​​ ​Anyway, onto business.​ ​​

14
00:00:23,574 --> 00:00:25,476
​​​ ​Let's introduce the cast.​ ​​

15
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,678
​​​ ​See me! Hear me!​ ​​

16
00:00:27,678 --> 00:00:31,348
​​​ ​My name is La+ Darknesss!​ ​​

17
00:00:30,347 --> 00:00:33,617
​​​ ​La+ Darknesss​ ​​

18
00:00:31,815 --> 00:00:33,617
​​​ ​Alright. Guest 2?​ ​​

19
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:35,486
​​​ ​Did I Luive you waiting?​ ​​

20
00:00:35,486 --> 00:00:39,823
​​​ ​I'm holoX's XO, Takane Lui!​ ​​

21
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:41,825
​​​ ​Takane Lui​ ​​

22
00:00:39,823 --> 00:00:43,160
​​​ ​'Kay. Guest 3?​ ​​

23
00:00:43,727 --> 00:00:45,195
​​​ ​Hey! Kikkiriki!​ ​​

24
00:00:45,195 --> 00:00:47,831
​​​ ​I'm Takanashi Kiara​ ​​
​​ ​from hololive English!​ ​​

25
00:00:46,663 --> 00:00:51,902
​​​ ​Takanashi Kiara​ ​​

26
00:00:47,831 --> 00:00:50,367
​​​ ​Thanks for having me!​ ​​

27
00:00:50,367 --> 00:00:55,039
​​​ ​Today's episode will feature us three.​ ​​

28
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:57,141
​​​ ​Anyway!​ ​​

29
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:57,141
​​​ ​Yeah!​ ​​

30
00:00:58,842 --> 00:01:01,011
​​​ ​I will be your MC for today...​ ​​

31
00:01:01,011 --> 00:01:03,981
​​​ ​I don't wanna be the MC!​ ​​

32
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:08,018
​​​ ​Don't you get to show off​ ​​
​​ ​more as the MC?​ ​​

33
00:01:08,085 --> 00:01:08,285
​​​ ​Wha!​ ​​

34
00:01:08,285 --> 00:01:08,585
​​​ ​Huh!​ ​​

35
00:01:08,585 --> 00:01:09,053
​​​ ​Nghah!​ ​​

36
00:01:09,053 --> 00:01:09,353
​​​ ​Aah...​ ​​

37
00:01:09,353 --> 00:01:10,654
​​​ ​Such audacity!​ ​​

38
00:01:11,688 --> 00:01:13,757
​​​ ​So since it's gonna be us three today,​ ​​

39
00:01:13,757 --> 00:01:16,293
​​​ ​and this being my first time​ ​​
​​ ​meeting Kiara-san and all,​ ​​

40
00:01:16,293 --> 00:01:18,562
​​​ ​we tried to find a common connection.​ ​​

41
00:01:18,562 --> 00:01:20,264
​​​ ​It ended up being the birds, right?​ ​​

42
00:01:20,264 --> 00:01:22,733
​​​ ​Yeah, these guys.​ ​​
​​ ​Mine's bigger though.​ ​​

43
00:01:22,733 --> 00:01:25,202
​​​ ​We both have one on our heads.​ ​​

44
00:01:25,202 --> 00:01:27,271
​​​ ​They're cute!​ ​​

45
00:01:27,271 --> 00:01:30,441
​​​ ​Kiara-san's way too kind...​ ​​

46
00:01:30,441 --> 00:01:33,310
​​​ ​It's possible these two​ ​​

47
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:37,047
​​​ ​would start fighting all of a sudden though.​ ​​

48
00:01:36,046 --> 00:01:39,049
​​​ ​They could go feral, yeah.​ ​​

49
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,184
​​​ ​That'd be pretty wholesome.​ ​​

50
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:41,485
​​​ ​How?!​ ​​

51
00:01:40,617 --> 00:01:41,485
​​​ ​Now that's scary.​ ​​

52
00:01:41,485 --> 00:01:42,820
​​​ ​Don't make them fight.​ ​​

53
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,289
​​​ ​They'd be friendly enough​ ​​
​​ ​to jab at each other.​ ​​

54
00:01:45,289 --> 00:01:47,691
​​​ ​Well, since that ended on a happy note,​ ​​

55
00:01:48,425 --> 00:01:52,029
​​​ ​let's move on to our first segment!​ ​​

56
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:53,697
​​​ ​The first segment is...​ ​​

57
00:01:54,331 --> 00:01:56,867
​​​ ​Random Rapid Fire Interrogation!​ ​​

58
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:02,339
​​​ ​Okay, so for this segment,​ ​​

59
00:02:02,339 --> 00:02:04,608
​​​ ​Kiara-san will be pelted​ ​​

60
00:02:04,608 --> 00:02:06,610
​​​ ​with a barrage of questions​ ​​

61
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:10,047
​​​ ​by us, the pair who've been​ ​​
​​ ​on this show before.​ ​​

62
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:12,916
​​​ ​Are you ready, Kiara-san?​ ​​

63
00:02:14,151 --> 00:02:16,253
​​​ ​I think... I'll be fine!​ ​​

64
00:02:16,253 --> 00:02:17,955
​​​ ​What'chu got for me?​ ​​

65
00:02:17,955 --> 00:02:19,356
​​​ ​Let's begin!​ ​​

66
00:02:19,923 --> 00:02:21,892
​​​ ​20 Question Barrage...​ ​​

67
00:02:22,326 --> 00:02:24,194
​​​ ​Start!​ ​​

68
00:02:24,194 --> 00:02:27,664
​​​ ​Do you remember ever calling me​ ​​
​​ ​cringe in one of your streams?💢​ ​​

69
00:02:28,031 --> 00:02:29,600
​​​ ​That... wasn't me!​ ​​

70
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,734
​​​ ​Nuh-uh!​ ​​

71
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:33,036
​​​ ​That's cheating!​ ​​

72
00:02:33,036 --> 00:02:35,839
​​​ ​Be honest.​ ​​
​​ ​Would you... go out with me?❤️​ ​​

73
00:02:36,507 --> 00:02:39,977
​​​ ​Like to a barbecue place?​ ​​

74
00:02:39,977 --> 00:02:42,880
​​​ ​Where do you want to travel to the most?​ ​​

75
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,749
​​​ ​I'd say Japan and Korea.​ ​​

76
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,584
​​​ ​Sounds nice.​ ​​

77
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:51,655
​​​ ​If you were to travel with me,​ ​​
​​ ​where would we go?​ ​​

78
00:02:52,656 --> 00:02:53,924
​​​ ​Why are you hesitating?!​ ​​

79
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,225
​​​ ​I don't actually feel like​ ​​
​​ ​going anywhere with you.​ ​​

80
00:02:55,225 --> 00:02:57,094
​​​ ​Why would you say that?!​ ​​

81
00:02:57,094 --> 00:03:00,164
​​​ ​Where would you want​ ​​
​​ ​to show me around?​ ​​

82
00:03:00,164 --> 00:03:02,633
​​​ ​Laplanet, I guess?​ ​​

83
00:03:02,633 --> 00:03:04,434
​​​ ​Let's go with that.​ ​​

84
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,870
​​​ ​You don't sound enthusiastic at all!​ ​​

85
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,507
​​​ ​If you were to become a different​ ​​
​​ ​kind of bird, what would you be?​ ​​

86
00:03:11,074 --> 00:03:14,044
​​​ ​An owl, since they're really cute.​ ​​

87
00:03:14,044 --> 00:03:15,846
​​​ ​Ooh! Mumei!​ ​​

88
00:03:15,846 --> 00:03:16,880
​​​ ​Yes!​ ​​

89
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,251
​​​ ​If hololive had a dating sim,​ ​​
​​ ​whose route will you go for first?​ ​​

90
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:26,223
​​​ ​My hololive English genmate, Amelia-chan!​ ​​

91
00:03:26,223 --> 00:03:29,293
​​​ ​What goals do you have for this year?​ ​​

92
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:31,161
​​​ ​Let's see. Release an album.​ ​​

93
00:03:31,161 --> 00:03:34,831
​​​ ​Perform a concert in 3D.​ ​​

94
00:03:34,831 --> 00:03:37,267
​​​ ​Actually have a 3D debut.​ ​​

95
00:03:37,267 --> 00:03:39,836
​​​ ​And to meet with my genmates!​ ​​

96
00:03:39,836 --> 00:03:42,339
​​​ ​I haven't met any of them​ ​​
​​ ​apart from Calli-chan.​ ​​

97
00:03:40,337 --> 00:03:42,339
​​​ ​Ah! Same here!​ ​​

98
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:47,077
​​​ ​And that's all of our questions!​ ​​

99
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:45,742
​​​ ​That's all!​ ​​

100
00:03:47,077 --> 00:03:50,380
​​​ ​You said you don't want​ ​​
​​ ​to travel with me, Kiara-san?​ ​​

101
00:03:50,847 --> 00:03:52,883
​​​ ​She was thinking twice there.​ ​​

102
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:53,584
​​​ ​That was, umm...​ ​​

103
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:54,284
​​​ ​She was hesitating, yeah.​ ​​

104
00:03:53,584 --> 00:03:57,921
​​​ ​People would see it as an adult​ ​​
​​ ​dragging a kid around places, so...​ ​​

105
00:03:55,118 --> 00:03:55,886
​​​ ​Hey now!​ ​​

106
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,921
​​​ ​I ain't a kid!​ ​​

107
00:03:57,921 --> 00:04:00,591
​​​ ​She can be quite a handful too...​ ​​

108
00:03:59,556 --> 00:04:00,591
​​​ ​Hold. Hold it.​ ​​

109
00:04:00,591 --> 00:04:02,826
​​​ ​I can handle myself just fine.​ ​​

110
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,828
​​​ ​―Is what she says, Kiara-san.​ ​​

111
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:03,961
​​​ ​Totally.​ ​​

112
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,897
​​​ ​Would you still take her around?​ ​​

113
00:04:05,395 --> 00:04:09,766
​​​ ​Have you ever done an errand alone before?​ ​​

114
00:04:07,297 --> 00:04:09,766
​​​ ​Why'd you have to ask that?!​ ​​

115
00:04:09,766 --> 00:04:12,769
​​​ ​I go out and buy my groceries​ ​​
​​ ​myself like a normal person!​ ​​

116
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:14,071
​​​ ​Really? Good job!​ ​​

117
00:04:15,038 --> 00:04:17,274
​​​ ​To think I'd get brownie points for that...​ ​​

118
00:04:17,274 --> 00:04:18,809
​​​ ​Nothing about trips with you though.​ ​​

119
00:04:17,274 --> 00:04:18,308
​​​ ​Oh, mama!​ ​​

120
00:04:18,809 --> 00:04:20,344
​​​ ​Come on now!​ ​​

121
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:21,712
​​​ ​Pretty much.​ ​​

122
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:22,746
​​​ ​I thought we were doing well.​ ​​

123
00:04:22,746 --> 00:04:25,282
​​​ ​I'm ending this segment right here!​ ​​

124
00:04:25,282 --> 00:04:27,217
​​​ ​'Kay!​ ​​

125
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,485
​​​ ​I wanted to ask one more thing. Can I?​ ​​

126
00:04:28,485 --> 00:04:30,654
​​​ ​Fine. I'll allow it.​ ​​

127
00:04:30,654 --> 00:04:34,458
​​​ ​When I asked who you would go for first​ ​​
​​ ​in a hololive dating sim,​ ​​

128
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:37,961
​​​ ​you answered, "Ame-chan."​ ​​

129
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:39,096
​​​ ​Yeees?​ ​​

130
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:40,197
​​​ ​Any reason for that choice?​ ​​

131
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,497
​​​ ​Good question.​ ​​

132
00:04:40,497 --> 00:04:42,099
​​​ ​Hmm, why did I...?​ ​​

133
00:04:42,099 --> 00:04:46,970
​​​ ​I figured... she'd be an adorable option.​ ​​

134
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,839
​​​ ​Oh, but here's the thing.​ ​​

135
00:04:47,571 --> 00:04:48,839
​​​ ​Cute...​ ​​

136
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:50,974
​​​ ​Miko-senpai also answered​ ​​

137
00:04:50,974 --> 00:04:53,844
​​​ ​"Ame-chan" to this question, right?​ ​​

138
00:04:53,477 --> 00:04:55,512
​​​ ​Oh, she's a rival!​ ​​

139
00:04:53,844 --> 00:04:55,512
​​​ ​She's your rival, huh?​ ​​

140
00:04:55,512 --> 00:04:58,882
​​​ ​Ame-chan's a really hot pick for these things.​ ​​

141
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,550
​​​ ​She <i>is </i>cute and funny...​ ​​

142
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,550
​​​ ​You're not gonna pick me?​ ​​

143
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,052
​​​ ​(Heh.)​ ​​

144
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:05,622
​​​ ​You'd seem like the easiest route to clear.​ ​​

145
00:05:04,121 --> 00:05:05,622
​​​ ​How come?!​ ​​

146
00:05:05,622 --> 00:05:07,124
​​​ ​Just simply giving you snacks would...​ ​​

147
00:05:07,124 --> 00:05:09,026
​​​ ​Wha... I'm not <i>that </i>cheap!​ ​​

148
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:12,262
​​​ ​Let's move on to our next segment!​ ​​

149
00:05:13,263 --> 00:05:18,368
​​​ ​Protect Her Dignity!​ ​​
​​ ​Lap-sama's 10― Actually, 5 Questions!​ ​​

150
00:05:20,003 --> 00:05:24,708
​​​ ​Anyway, we'll now be doing my segment.​ ​​

151
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:29,813
​​​ ​It originally had ten questions,​ ​​
​​ ​but we cut it down to five.​ ​​

152
00:05:29,813 --> 00:05:32,049
​​​ ​Too easy otherwise.​ ​​

153
00:05:31,281 --> 00:05:32,049
​​​ ​Yeah.​ ​​

154
00:05:32,049 --> 00:05:34,518
​​​ ​I'm the Founder of Secret Society holoX.​ ​​

155
00:05:34,518 --> 00:05:38,055
​​​ ​In other words, I have to play​ ​​
​​ ​a proper mysterious figure flawlessly.​ ​​

156
00:05:38,055 --> 00:05:40,057
​​​ ​However, it feels like​ ​​

157
00:05:40,057 --> 00:05:43,860
​​​ ​I'm losing my dignity at each​ ​​
​​ ​passing day since I debuted.​ ​​

158
00:05:43,493 --> 00:05:44,995
​​​ ​More like it's already gone.​ ​​

159
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,529
​​​ ​Says the script.​ ​​

160
00:05:45,529 --> 00:05:48,365
​​​ ​With that said,​ ​​
​​ ​I've prepared a segment​ ​​

161
00:05:48,365 --> 00:05:50,967
​​​ ​that'll help me regain my dignity​ ​​
​​ ​as the Founder of holoX!​ ​​

162
00:05:50,967 --> 00:05:52,536
​​​ ​Says the script.​ ​​

163
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,572
​​​ ​Okay! Eyes on the board!​ ​​

164
00:05:55,572 --> 00:06:00,544
​​​ ​Snail​ ​​

165
00:05:55,572 --> 00:06:00,544

210
00:06:26,403 --> 00:06:30,040

​​​ ​No!​ ​​

212
00:06:32,376 --> 00:06:34,277
​​​ ​Hmm. So not a plant.​ ​​

213
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:37,514
​​​ ​Is it an animal?​ ​​

214
00:06:38,415 --> 00:06:39,816

​​​ ​Frog!​ ​​

224
00:06:55,432 --> 00:06:57,434
​​​ ​We still have two questions.​ ​​

225
00:06:57,434 --> 00:06:59,669
​​​ ​Have I once done​ ​​

226
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,805
​​​ ​an impression of it before?​ ​​

227
00:07:02,806 --> 00:07:03,907
​​​ ​Like you'd know though!​ ​​

228
00:07:03,907 --> 00:07:06,076
​​​ ​Wait um, have you?​ ​​

229
00:07:06,443 --> 00:07:07,778
​​​ ​I have!​ ​​

230
00:07:07,778 --> 00:07:09,780
​​​ ​Do it! Right here!​ ​​

231
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,515
​​​ ​Okay!​ ​​

232
00:07:13,417 --> 00:07:15,085
​​​ ​Wha! Huuuh?!​ ​​

233
00:07:15,652 --> 00:07:18,722
​​​ ​Where did you pull that from?!​ ​​

234
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,722
​​​ ​Too real! Too real!​ ​​

235
00:07:18,722 --> 00:07:21,057
​​​ ​Yes! Yes! Yes!​ ​​

236
00:07:21,057 --> 00:07:22,659
​​​ ​Yes! Yes!​ ​​

237
00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:23,427
​​​ ​Hmm.​ ​​

238
00:07:23,427 --> 00:07:24,928
​​​ ​Is there a variety​ ​​

239
00:07:25,662 --> 00:07:28,298
​​​ ​that is "black-spotted"?​ ​​

240
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,202
​​​ ​Umm. Y... Yes!​ ​​

241
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:35,372
​​​ ​Okay!​ ​​

242
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:38,241
​​​ ​Questioning over!​ ​​

243
00:07:38,241 --> 00:07:40,610
​​​ ​I already knew what it was.​ ​​

244
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,679
​​​ ​Someone already got it.​ ​​

245
00:07:43,447 --> 00:07:46,817
​​​ ​Well then. Please state your answers.​ ​​

246
00:07:46,817 --> 00:07:50,320
​​​ ​Alright. The answer is "frog."​ ​​

247
00:07:47,517 --> 00:07:49,219
​​​ ​It has to be "frog."​ ​​

248
00:07:51,021 --> 00:07:52,322
​​​ ​Is it?​ ​​

249
00:07:51,021 --> 00:07:53,023
​​​ ​That's the correct answer!​ ​​

250
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,325
​​​ ​Yay!​ ​​

251
00:07:55,826 --> 00:07:58,195
​​​ ​Took no time at all.​ ​​

252
00:07:55,826 --> 00:07:59,362
​​​ ​I guess that was a freebie for you guys?​ ​​

253
00:07:59,362 --> 00:08:02,232
​​​ ​The next one isn't gonna be that easy!​ ​​

254
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:06,036
​​​ ​I've already made my choice.​ ​​
​​ ​Start the next round.​ ​​

255
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:05,268
​​​ ​Let's start.​ ​​

256
00:08:06,036 --> 00:08:09,906
​​​ ​Is this an object?​ ​​

257
00:08:10,774 --> 00:08:11,441
​​​ ​No!​ ​​

258
00:08:11,441 --> 00:08:13,376
​​​ ​Is this an animal?​ ​​

259
00:08:13,376 --> 00:08:14,044
​​​ ​No!​ ​​

260
00:08:14,044 --> 00:08:16,246
​​​ ​Is this a plant?​ ​​

261
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:17,180
​​​ ​No!​ ​​

262
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,649
​​​ ​Oh? That narrows it down!​ ​​

263
00:08:19,649 --> 00:08:21,751
​​​ ​Is it a flower?​ ​​

264
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:22,319
​​​ ​No!​ ​​

265
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:24,387
​​​ ​Hm?​ ​​

266
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:24,387
​​​ ​Ah.​ ​​

267
00:08:24,387 --> 00:08:26,690
​​​ ​Flowers are plants.​ ​​

268
00:08:24,387 --> 00:08:26,690
​​​ ​From "not a plant" to "flower"...​ ​​

269
00:08:25,288 --> 00:08:26,690
​​​ ​Flowers are plants too.​ ​​

270
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:30,427
​​​ ​You have to answer​ ​​
​​ ​after your last question!​ ​​

271
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:31,695
​​​ ​Is it...​ ​​

272
00:08:32,996 --> 00:08:35,866
​​​ ​Something that makes you happy?​ ​​

273
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:38,368
​​​ ​...Yes!​ ​​

274
00:08:38,368 --> 00:08:40,804
​​​ ​Right! Okay!​ ​​

275
00:08:41,838 --> 00:08:43,773
​​​ ​P-Please give me your answer...​ ​​

276
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:47,010
​​​ ​I'd go with "June bride."​ ​​
​​ ​How about you, Kiara-san?​ ​​

277
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:52,015
​​​ ​June brides are like​ ​​

278
00:08:52,015 --> 00:08:55,218
​​​ ​people who get married in June, right?​ ​​

279
00:08:55,218 --> 00:08:58,054
​​​ ​They say June is an auspicious month​ ​​

280
00:08:58,054 --> 00:09:00,524
​​​ ​for holding weddings,​ ​​

281
00:09:00,524 --> 00:09:02,192
​​​ ​at least here in Japan.​ ​​

282
00:09:02,192 --> 00:09:03,860
​​​ ​TIL!​ ​​

283
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,096
​​​ ​It's not a thing overseas, is it?​ ​​

284
00:09:06,096 --> 00:09:07,364
​​​ ​Oh really?​ ​​

285
00:09:06,096 --> 00:09:08,265
​​​ ​That would be a happy moment, yeah.​ ​​

286
00:09:08,265 --> 00:09:10,166
​​​ ​Let's go with "June bride."​ ​​

287
00:09:11,668 --> 00:09:13,570
​​​ ​The correct answer is...​ ​​

288
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:15,205
​​​ ​"June bride"...!​ ​​

289
00:09:16,606 --> 00:09:18,842
​​​ ​We got it!​ ​​

290
00:09:16,606 --> 00:09:18,308
​​​ ​Yeah!​ ​​

291
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,643
​​​ ​Ugh, why did you get it?!​ ​​

292
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:22,379
​​​ ​Don't shoot me with​ ​​
​​ ​that question at the very end!​ ​​

293
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:24,581
​​​ ​I thought I'd win this round, too...​ ​​

294
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:24,581
​​​ ​Heck yeah!​ ​​

295
00:09:24,581 --> 00:09:26,483
​​​ ​I got her bullseye!​ ​​

296
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:28,885
​​​ ​How the heck did you​ ​​
​​ ​come up with that anyway?​ ​​

297
00:09:28,885 --> 00:09:33,557
​​​ ​If you answered no, it'd be down to​ ​​
​​ ​"uniform change" and "rainy season."​ ​​

298
00:09:33,557 --> 00:09:37,360
​​​ ​But mentioning the rain early on​ ​​
​​ ​kinda eliminated that choice...​ ​​

299
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,462
​​​ ​Are we doing mind games now?!​ ​​

300
00:09:39,462 --> 00:09:42,198
​​​ ​Your only info should come​ ​​
​​ ​from Yes/No questions!​ ​​

00:09:53,877 --> 00:09:58,381
​​​ ​This is the XO segment,​ ​​
​​ ​so I'll leave the intro to her.​ ​​

307
00:09:55,545 --> 00:09:56,546
​​​ ​Yep!​ ​​

308
00:09:58,381 --> 00:10:04,321
​​​ ​I, Takane Lui, a former​ ​​

​​​ ​What to say when you oversleep​ ​​
​​ ​and break a date with your friend.​ ​​

317
00:10:18,568 --> 00:10:20,937
​​​ ​I'm going to throw out a situation,​ ​​

318
00:10:21,137 --> 00:10:25,775
​​​ ​and we'll test whether you can​ ​​
​​ ​give the best response for it.​ ​​

319
00:10:25,775 --> 00:10:29,713
​​​ ​Today we'll be using​ ​​
​​ ​a variety of prompts​ ​​

320
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:32,649
​​​ ​provided to us by the viewers!​ ​​

321
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:35,619
​​​ ​Please focus your attention on the board.​ ​​

322
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:39,322
​​​ ​"How to handle a conversation​ ​​
​​ ​with an acquaintance​ ​​

323
00:10:39,322 --> 00:10:44,361
​​​ ​you have little in common with​ ​​
​​ ​when left alone with them."​ ​​

324
00:10:44,794 --> 00:10:46,596
​​​ ​An example for this is​ ​​

325
00:10:46,596 --> 00:10:50,066
​​​ ​when you both have a common friend,​ ​​

326
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:53,370
​​​ ​and you're all hanging out.​ ​​

327
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:54,704
​​​ ​Said friend then suddenly​ ​​

328
00:10:54,704 --> 00:10:57,974
​​​ ​goes out to buy some snacks​ ​​

329
00:10:57,974 --> 00:11:00,810
​​​ ​or excuses themselves to go to the washroom.​ ​​

330
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:05,649
​​​ ​You're now left alone​ ​​
​​ ​with that friend of a friend.​ ​​

331
00:11:06,116 --> 00:11:09,185
​​​ ​How will you talk to them?​ ​​

332
00:11:09,185 --> 00:11:11,821
​​​ ​Take your time to think about that.​ ​​

333
00:11:11,821 --> 00:11:13,523
​​​ ​You guys ready?​ ​​

334
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,791
​​​ ​I'm thinking up of legit scenarios now...​ ​​

335
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,089
​​​ ​Yep!​ ​​

336
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:18,294
​​​ ​I'll be taking this seriously too!​ ​​

337
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:17,627
​​​ ​Okay!​ ​​

338
00:11:18,294 --> 00:11:20,063
​​​ ​Alright then.​ ​​

339
00:11:20,063 --> 00:11:22,666
​​​ ​Start the thinking time!​ ​​

340
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,868
​​​ ​I've already written mine.​ ​​

341
00:11:24,868 --> 00:11:26,002
​​​ ​You're done?​ ​​

342
00:11:26,636 --> 00:11:28,104
​​​ ​This has to be it.​ ​​

343
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,240
​​​ ​I'll write my answer then.​ ​​

344
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:30,807
​​​ ​'Kay.​ ​​

345
00:11:30,807 --> 00:11:32,242
​​​ ​Is there a correct answer?​ ​​

346
00:11:32,242 --> 00:11:34,477
​​​ ​There are a lot of possible answers,​ ​​

347
00:11:34,477 --> 00:11:37,447
​​​ ​but you'll have to guess <i>my </i>answer.​ ​​

348
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:41,818
​​​ ​Thinking time is over!​ ​​

349
00:11:41,818 --> 00:11:44,954
​​​ ​Let's go over everyone's answers.​ ​​

350
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:48,825
​​​ ​Let's start with La+.​ ​​
​​ ​She was pretty confident in her answer.​ ​​

351
00:11:48,825 --> 00:11:50,694
​​​ ​This is <b>the </b>answer!​ ​​

352
00:11:50,694 --> 00:11:53,463
​​​ ​It can't be anything else!​ ​​

353
00:11:51,027 --> 00:11:53,463
​​​ ​Oh? Let's see La+'s answer.​ ​​

354
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:58,034
​​​ ​Her answer to this problem is...​ ​​

355
00:11:58,034 --> 00:12:00,437
​​​ ​Toilet! lol​ ​​

356
00:11:58,334 --> 00:12:00,437
​​​ ​'Scuse me! 👉🏼🚽​ ​​

357
00:12:00,437 --> 00:12:01,738
​​​ ​You're terrible!​ ​​

358
00:12:00,437 --> 00:12:02,305
​​​ ​This is the only option.​ ​​

359
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:05,308
​​​ ​It won't leave us in an awkward silence,​ ​​

360
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:06,810
​​​ ​and I can always come out late and say,​ ​​

361
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:09,979
​​​ ​"Sorry, potted the potty."​ ​​

362
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,715
​​​ ​That should lighten the mood.​ ​​

363
00:12:11,715 --> 00:12:14,818
​​​ ​We're supposed to learn​ ​​
​​ ​conversational skills.​ ​​

364
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:16,886
​​​ ​What's running away gonna do?​ ​​

365
00:12:15,351 --> 00:12:19,155
​​​ ​I mean, if you think​ ​​
​​ ​you're gonna fail anyway,​ ​​

366
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:22,125
​​​ ​then you better quit while you're ahead​ ​​

367
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:24,227
​​​ ​and play it safe!​ ​​

368
00:12:24,227 --> 00:12:26,096
​​​ ​What's your take, Kiara-san?​ ​​

369
00:12:26,096 --> 00:12:27,163
​​​ ​Well, you mustn't run away.​ ​​

370
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:27,797
​​​ ​You mustn't run away.​ ​​

371
00:12:27,797 --> 00:12:29,666
​​​ ​You mustn't run away!​ ​​

372
00:12:28,965 --> 00:12:29,666
​​​ ​No!​ ​​

373
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:30,567
​​​ ​Shinji...​ ​​

374
00:12:30,567 --> 00:12:32,268
​​​ ​I don't wanna ride it!​ ​​

375
00:12:32,268 --> 00:12:34,704
​​​ ​If you talk so big,​ ​​
​​ ​why don't you show us the answer?​ ​​

376
00:12:34,704 --> 00:12:38,041
​​​ ​Let's see Kiara-san's answer then!​ ​​

377
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:39,576
​​​ ​Would it be readable...​ ​​

378
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:41,444
​​​ ​This is Kiara-senpai's answer!​ ​​

379
00:12:41,444 --> 00:12:43,513
​​​ ​Start the convo with,​ ​​

380
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:47,016
​​​ ​"Hey. So where did you first meet XX?"​ ​​

381
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:50,553
​​​ ​Whoa! Splendid answer!​ ​​

382
00:12:50,086 --> 00:12:52,055
​​​ ​You're not half bad yourself...​ ​​

383
00:12:50,553 --> 00:12:54,657
​​​ ​I should probably show my answer now.​ ​​

384
00:12:54,657 --> 00:12:55,258
​​​ ​Sure.​ ​​

385
00:12:55,258 --> 00:12:56,559
​​​ ​Here it is.​ ​​

386
00:12:57,127 --> 00:12:59,129
​​​ ​"So when did you first meet XX?"​ ​​

387
00:12:58,728 --> 00:13:00,263
​​​ ​They're similar!​ ​​

388
00:12:59,129 --> 00:13:02,298
​​​ ​"Just curious."​ ​​

389
00:13:01,765 --> 00:13:03,767
​​​ ​They're very similar!​ ​​

390
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:06,302
​​​ ​I'd say you didn't just get the correct answer,​ ​​

391
00:13:06,302 --> 00:13:10,106
​​​ ​but we actually got​ ​​
​​ ​matching answers, Kiara-san!​ ​​

392
00:13:09,005 --> 00:13:10,106
​​​ ​Seriously?!​ ​​

393
00:13:10,106 --> 00:13:13,910
​​​ ​Do you intend to expand​ ​​
​​ ​the convo from there?​ ​​

394
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:17,380
​​​ ​I'm actually pretty good​ ​​
​​ ​at handling these things.​ ​​

395
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,916
​​​ ​Even hololive English members would say​ ​​

396
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:24,521
​​​ ​that I'm very approachable​ ​​
​​ ​and easy to talk to.​ ​​

397
00:13:24,521 --> 00:13:28,792
​​​ ​I've never been called​ ​​
​​ ​"approachable and easy to talk to"...​ ​​

398
00:13:24,954 --> 00:13:26,656
​​​ ​I've heard as much, yeah.​ ​​

399
00:13:28,792 --> 00:13:30,894
​​​ ​If it's a friend of a friend,​ ​​

400
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:35,698
​​​ ​then you can use your​ ​​
​​ ​common friend as a starter topic.​ ​​

401
00:13:35,698 --> 00:13:39,502
​​​ ​From there, you can​ ​​
​​ ​tangent off to other things.​ ​​

402
00:13:39,502 --> 00:13:43,072
​​​ ​Like you'd say,​ ​​
​​ ​"Oh, I met them from this game."​ ​​

403
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:47,110
​​​ ​And they might say,​ ​​
​​ ​"I play that game too!"​ ​​

404
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:49,179
​​​ ​Then the conversation just goes on.​ ​​

405
00:13:49,179 --> 00:13:52,182
​​​ ​You find the opportunity​ ​​
​​ ​to talk about something,​ ​​

406
00:13:52,182 --> 00:13:56,586
​​​ ​then let the conversation​ ​​
​​ ​naturally flow from there.​ ​​

407
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:59,022
​​​ ​You're now the avatar of communication.​ ​​

408
00:13:59,022 --> 00:14:00,490
​​​ ​Avatar of Communication​ ​​

409
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:01,925
​​​ ​Thank you for the praise.​ ​​

410
00:14:01,891 --> 00:14:02,926
​​​ ​Damn it.​ ​​

411
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:04,661
​​​ ​I will now go by the name of​ ​​
​​ ​Communication of holoX.​ ​​

412
00:14:04,661 --> 00:14:06,563
​​​ ​Waha. Haha. Haha.​ ​​

413
00:14:07,463 --> 00:14:08,598
​​​ ​Cut the canned laugh.​ ​​

414
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,133
​​​ ​Haha. Haha. Haha.​ ​​

415
00:14:10,133 --> 00:14:13,069
​​​ ​Let's move to the next problem!​ ​​

416
00:14:13,069 --> 00:14:15,839
​​​ ​Kiara-senpai's pretty good at this.​ ​​

417
00:14:15,471 --> 00:14:16,606
​​​ ​She good.​ ​​

418
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,340
​​​ ​It's reassuring.​ ​​

419
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,575
​​​ ​Leave the talking to me!​ ​​

420
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,575
​​​ ​She's too good!​ ​​

421
00:14:18,575 --> 00:14:22,278
​​​ ​I guess I should show my skills on the next one!​ ​​

422
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,947
​​​ ​Is there anything to show?​ ​​

423
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,947
​​​ ​Sure, sure.​ ​​

424
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:25,715
​​​ ​Damn you!​ ​​

425
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:27,250
​​​ ​Let's show the next situation now!​ ​​

426
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,284
​​​ ​Here it is!​ ​​

427
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:36,125
​​​ ​"What do you say to a new employee​ ​​
​​ ​to cheer them up after their first big blunder?"​ ​​

428
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,126
​​​ ​Oh, I see.​ ​​

429
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:39,395
​​​ ​Well, I've got 4 whole subordinates.​ ​​

430
00:14:39,395 --> 00:14:40,663
​​​ ​Right you are.​ ​​

431
00:14:40,663 --> 00:14:43,333
​​​ ​Sakamata, for one,​ ​​
​​ ​makes pretty big mistakes.​ ​​

432
00:14:44,067 --> 00:14:45,602
​​​ ​So what would you say​ ​​

433
00:14:45,602 --> 00:14:48,638
​​​ ​to those kinds of newcomers​ ​​
​​ ​when they're down​ ​​

434
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:51,074
​​​ ​while giving them​ ​​
​​ ​a few pats on the shoulder?​ ​​

435
00:14:51,074 --> 00:14:52,242
​​​ ​Okay.​ ​​

436
00:14:52,242 --> 00:14:56,746
​​​ ​Well, then. Let's take a look​ ​​
​​ ​at each of their answers.​ ​​

437
00:14:56,746 --> 00:14:58,715
​​​ ​Anyone confident with their answer?​ ​​

438
00:14:58,715 --> 00:15:00,216
​​​ ​Of course I am!​ ​​

439
00:14:59,249 --> 00:15:00,216
​​​ ​Me!​ ​​

440
00:15:00,216 --> 00:15:02,118
​​​ ​Me! Me! Me!​ ​​

441
00:15:02,118 --> 00:15:04,621
​​​ ​Well, since La+ went first last time,​ ​​

442
00:15:04,621 --> 00:15:07,156
​​​ ​let's go with Kiara-senpai this time!​ ​​

443
00:15:06,289 --> 00:15:08,358
​​​ ​Darn it.​ ​​

444
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,358
​​​ ​Okay.​ ​​

445
00:15:08,358 --> 00:15:12,896
​​​ ​Kiara-senpai's answer is...​ ​​

446
00:15:12,896 --> 00:15:15,565
​​​ ​"I've made that mistake before, too.​ ​​

447
00:15:15,565 --> 00:15:16,699
​​​ ​It's fine!"​ ​​

448
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,501
​​​ ​Ah!​ ​​

449
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:19,636
​​​ ​That's so nice.​ ​​

450
00:15:19,636 --> 00:15:21,437
​​​ ​It's really nice.​ ​​

451
00:15:21,437 --> 00:15:24,173
​​​ ​I couldn't help but be honest.​ ​​

452
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:27,076
​​​ ​I thought it would be reassuring​ ​​
​​ ​for an experienced veteran​ ​​

453
00:15:27,076 --> 00:15:29,412
​​​ ​to tell them that​ ​​
​​ ​they've done that before​ ​​

454
00:15:29,412 --> 00:15:34,183
​​​ ​and that it's a common mistake.​ ​​

455
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:34,918
​​​ ​I feel the same!​ ​​

456
00:15:34,918 --> 00:15:37,220
​​​ ​It's a great answer.​ ​​

457
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,022
​​​ ​I give you my respect as a rival.​ ​​

458
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:42,926
​​​ ​Kiara-senpai's answer is really reassuring.​ ​​

459
00:15:42,926 --> 00:15:45,895
​​​ ​I'd rather not move onto La+'s answer​ ​​

460
00:15:45,295 --> 00:15:46,296
​​​ ​Why not?!​ ​​

461
00:15:45,895 --> 00:15:47,530
​​​ ​after seeing that,​ ​​

462
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:50,667
​​​ ​but please go ahead, La+.​ ​​

463
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:51,668
​​​ ​Ready.​ ​​

464
00:15:51,668 --> 00:15:55,338
​​​ ​"Geez (chuckle), you're such a dunce, huh.​ ​​

465
00:15:55,338 --> 00:15:57,907
​​​ ​Though, that's what makes you great."​ ​​

466
00:15:57,907 --> 00:15:58,775
​​​ ​I'm gonna hurl.​ ​​

467
00:15:58,775 --> 00:16:01,210
​​​ ​What was wrong with it?!​ ​​

468
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,846
​​​ ​I hate the "Geez" at the start.​ ​​

469
00:16:03,846 --> 00:16:04,914
​​​ ​Why?!​ ​​

470
00:16:04,914 --> 00:16:07,650
​​​ ​It has (chuckle) after it.​ ​​

471
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:10,620
​​​ ​So you'd laugh at someone feeling down?​ ​​

472
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:14,090
​​​ ​I'm trying to express that​ ​​
​​ ​I'm not bothered by the mistake!​ ​​

473
00:16:13,589 --> 00:16:15,024
​​​ ​I see.​ ​​

474
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,692
​​​ ​Like, "Geez."​ ​​

475
00:16:15,692 --> 00:16:21,731
​​​ ​When you're down,​ ​​
​​ ​you tend to get tunnel-visioned.​ ​​

476
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,267
​​​ ​Darn it. Gotta butter them up more.​ ​​

477
00:16:22,465 --> 00:16:23,933
​​​ ​Yeah.​ ​​

478
00:16:24,267 --> 00:16:28,638
​​​ ​La+'s answer is really good,​ ​​

479
00:16:28,638 --> 00:16:32,508
​​​ ​but I think you need​ ​​
​​ ​to add something more.​ ​​

480
00:16:32,508 --> 00:16:37,113
​​​ ​Though, if it's to someone at​ ​​
​​ ​Sakamata's level, it's probably fine.​ ​​

481
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:37,113
​​​ ​"At Sakamata's level."​ ​​

482
00:16:37,113 --> 00:16:39,615
​​​ ​Now for my answer.​ ​​

483
00:16:39,949 --> 00:16:42,352
​​​ ​Let's see if anyone's is similar.​ ​​

484
00:16:42,352 --> 00:16:44,787
​​​ ​My answer is this!​ ​​

485
00:16:44,787 --> 00:16:48,558
​​​ ​Surprise! It's the same as Kiara-senpai's!​ ​​

486
00:16:46,222 --> 00:16:47,557
​​​ ​What?!​ ​​

487
00:16:47,557 --> 00:16:49,625
​​​ ​Wait!​ ​​

488
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:53,029
​​​ ​"It's fine! I made​ ​​
​​ ​the same mistake before, too!"​ ​​

489
00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:54,030
​​​ ​What?!​ ​​

490
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:56,699
​​​ ​Did she pay you?!​ ​​

491
00:16:56,699 --> 00:16:59,268
​​​ ​I seriously didn't look.​ ​​

492
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:03,473
​​​ ​If you make them think,​ ​​
​​ ​"I'm not fit for this job,"​ ​​

493
00:17:03,473 --> 00:17:06,009
​​​ ​that'd be pretty unfortunate.​ ​​

494
00:17:06,009 --> 00:17:09,645
​​​ ​So by telling them,​ ​​
​​ ​"I'm still in this line of work,​ ​​

495
00:17:09,645 --> 00:17:15,284
​​​ ​but I made the same mistake​ ​​
​​ ​in the past, so it'll be fine,"​ ​​

496
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:19,022
​​​ ​you motivate them to keep going​ ​​
​​ ​by making them think,​ ​​

497
00:17:19,022 --> 00:17:22,492
​​​ ​"If I work hard, I can be​ ​​
​​ ​just like my superiors one day."​ ​​

498
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:26,763
​​​ ​So cheering them up in that way is good.​ ​​

499
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,530
​​​ ​I think so, too!​ ​​

500
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:30,033
​​​ ​That was impressive, Kiara-senpai.​ ​​

501
00:17:30,033 --> 00:17:32,001
​​​ ​Actually.​ ​​

502
00:17:31,334 --> 00:17:33,336
​​​ ​Wow.​ ​​

503
00:17:33,336 --> 00:17:36,105
​​​ ​Has anyone been this close in the past?​ ​​

504
00:17:36,105 --> 00:17:37,240
​​​ ​There hasn't.​ ​​

505
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,708
​​​ ​Nope.​ ​​

506
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:43,813
​​​ ​Last time there was a lunatic after all.​ ​​

507
00:17:44,013 --> 00:17:47,083
​​​ ​The next segment is...​ ​​

508
00:17:47,717 --> 00:17:51,721
​​​ ​KFP's Road to Greatness!​ ​​

509
00:17:52,922 --> 00:17:57,393
​​​ ​This is Kiara-san's segment.​ ​​

510
00:17:57,393 --> 00:17:59,062
​​​ ​Please introduce it!​ ​​

511
00:17:59,062 --> 00:18:00,329
​​​ ​Okay!​ ​​

512
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:05,201
​​​ ​I'm actually the CEO of KFP,​ ​​

513
00:18:05,201 --> 00:18:10,306
​​​ ​and I'm currently looking for a manager​ ​​
​​ ​for the Japan branch.​ ​​

514
00:18:10,306 --> 00:18:12,308
​​​ ​Me! Me! Me! Me!​ ​​

515
00:18:12,308 --> 00:18:14,644
​​​ ​I would be far better suited.​ ​​

516
00:18:14,644 --> 00:18:16,813
​​​ ​Do you even have that kind of time?​ ​​

517
00:18:16,813 --> 00:18:17,980
​​​ ​True.​ ​​

518
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,382
​​​ ​That's true.​ ​​

519
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:19,382
​​​ ​Well, that aside.​ ​​

520
00:18:19,382 --> 00:18:21,250
​​​ ​I do really need a manager,​ ​​

521
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:24,754
​​​ ​so I'll have you two participate in a test​ ​​

522
00:18:24,754 --> 00:18:27,557
​​​ ​to see whether you're fit for the job.​ ​​

523
00:18:26,956 --> 00:18:29,992
​​​ ​A test? I wonder what kind.​ ​​

524
00:18:29,992 --> 00:18:34,330
​​​ ​Do well, and it certainly​ ​​
​​ ​won't hurt your chances!​ ​​

525
00:18:32,795 --> 00:18:34,330
​​​ ​What?!​ ​​

526
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,199
​​​ ​"Won't hurt"?​ ​​

527
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:39,001
​​​ ​Doesn't seem like she really <i>wants </i>us.​ ​​

528
00:18:39,001 --> 00:18:42,705
​​​ ​Do we get a salary?​ ​​

529
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:45,541
​​​ ​Um... uh... I wonder?​ ​​

530
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,343
​​​ ​Try your best!​ ​​

531
00:18:47,343 --> 00:18:50,179
​​​ ​She might make us work for free.​ ​​

532
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:50,179
​​​ ​Anyway!​ ​​

533
00:18:50,179 --> 00:18:54,851
​​​ ​Let's get on with the test!​ ​​

534
00:18:54,851 --> 00:18:57,086
​​​ ​First up is this!​ ​​

535
00:18:57,086 --> 00:18:59,388
​​​ ​Manager Qualification #1:​ ​​

536
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:02,058
​​​ ​Proper assignment of staff!​ ​​

537
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,526
​​​ ​Assignment of staff.​ ​​

538
00:19:03,526 --> 00:19:05,094
​​​ ​A manager needs to have​ ​​

539
00:19:05,094 --> 00:19:08,097
​​​ ​the skill to figure out what task​ ​​

540
00:19:09,165 --> 00:19:11,167
​​​ ​each staff member is best suited to.​ ​​

541
00:19:11,167 --> 00:19:12,201
​​​ ​True.​ ​​

542
00:19:12,201 --> 00:19:16,005
​​​ ​You will be shown pictures​ ​​
​​ ​of four holo members.​ ​​

543
00:19:16,005 --> 00:19:19,308
​​​ ​You'll assign them to work the register,​ ​​
​​ ​cook in the kitchen,​ ​​

544
00:19:19,308 --> 00:19:24,780
​​​ ​hand out flyers, or deliver orders.​ ​​

545
00:19:25,348 --> 00:19:26,682
​​​ ​Okay!​ ​​

546
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,817
​​​ ​I wonder who we'll get.​ ​​

547
00:19:27,817 --> 00:19:31,053
​​​ ​If your assignments are the same as mine,​ ​​

548
00:19:31,053 --> 00:19:34,557
​​​ ​then you're fit for the manager role!​ ​​

549
00:19:35,191 --> 00:19:40,096
​​​ ​The holo members applying​ ​​
​​ ​for part-time jobs this time are...​ ​​

550
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:43,866
​​​ ​These four.​ ​​

551
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:56,746
​​​ ​Register​ ​​
​​ ​Kitchen​ ​​
​​ ​Flyers​ ​​
​​ ​Delivery​ ​​

552
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:56,746
​​​ ​Robocosan​ ​​

553
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:56,746
​​​ ​Oozora Subaru​ ​​

554
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:56,746
​​​ ​Houshou Marine​ ​​

555
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:56,746
​​​ ​Omaru Polka​ ​​

556
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:50,540
​​​ ​Roboco-san, Subaru-san,​ ​​
​​ ​Marine-san, and Polka-san.​ ​​

557
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:54,310
​​​ ​Your thinking time starts now!​ ​​

558
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,746
​​​ ​This is too easy.​ ​​

559
00:19:56,746 --> 00:19:58,381
​​​ ​Done!​ ​​

560
00:19:58,381 --> 00:19:59,115
​​​ ​So fast.​ ​​

561
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:00,149
​​​ ​Easy for me.​ ​​

562
00:20:00,149 --> 00:20:02,985
​​​ ​You <i>did </i>answer seriously, right?​ ​​

563
00:20:02,985 --> 00:20:04,520
​​​ ​Of course I did!​ ​​

564
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,256
​​​ ​I think I'll have chicken for dinner.​ ​​

565
00:20:07,256 --> 00:20:08,558
​​​ ​Ch-Chicken?!​ ​​

566
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:11,427
​​​ ​Uh, er... well, uh...​ ​​

567
00:20:11,427 --> 00:20:11,861
​​​ ​Uh-oh!​ ​​

568
00:20:11,861 --> 00:20:12,495
​​​ ​O-Oh crap!​ ​​

569
00:20:12,495 --> 00:20:13,663
​​​ ​You've done it now.​ ​​

570
00:20:13,663 --> 00:20:17,300
​​​ ​Though I agree,​ ​​
​​ ​this is making me crave chicken.​ ​​

571
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:17,300
​​​ ​It sure is.​ ​​

572
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,536
​​​ ​What, do I smell tasty?​ ​​

573
00:20:20,536 --> 00:20:21,204
​​​ ​Huh?​ ​​

574
00:20:21,204 --> 00:20:22,805
​​​ ​We haven't even fried you yet.​ ​​

575
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,307
​​​ ​Wait, what?​ ​​

576
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:27,877
​​​ ​Let's take a look at their responses!​ ​​

577
00:20:28,244 --> 00:20:33,482
​​​ ​Lui: Register: Marine-senpai​ ​​
​​ ​Kitchen: Roboco-senpai​ ​​
​​ ​Flyers: Subaru-senpai​ ​​
​​ ​Delivery: Polka-senpai​ ​​

578
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:32,515
​​​ ​Oh, I was debating between those two!​ ​​

579
00:20:32,515 --> 00:20:33,316
​​​ ​Which?​ ​​

580
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:36,686
​​​ ​Subaru-senpai and​ ​​
​​ ​Marine-senpai's assignments.​ ​​

581
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:38,721
​​​ ​La+: Register: Subaru-san​ ​​
​​ ​Kitchen: Roboco-san​ ​​
​​ ​Flyers: Marine-san​ ​​
​​ ​Delivery: Polka-san​ ​​

582
00:20:36,686 --> 00:20:38,721
​​​ ​Ah, I see.​ ​​

583
00:20:38,087 --> 00:20:38,721
​​​ ​I see.​ ​​

584
00:20:38,721 --> 00:20:41,190
​​​ ​Why did you two assign Marine-senpai​ ​​

585
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:45,361
​​​ ​and Subaru-senpai to the register?​ ​​

586
00:20:45,895 --> 00:20:48,364
​​​ ​Well, I just feel like Subaru-san...​ ​​

587
00:20:48,364 --> 00:20:53,135
​​​ ​It'd be nice to see her​ ​​
​​ ​at the register when you come in.​ ​​

588
00:20:53,135 --> 00:20:56,706
​​​ ​True, she'd create a nice atmosphere.​ ​​

589
00:20:54,804 --> 00:20:58,140
​​​ ​Right. She gives you​ ​​
​​ ​a good first impression.​ ​​

590
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,910
​​​ ​Then Roboco-san would run​ ​​
​​ ​a tight ship in the kitchen.​ ​​

591
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:04,313
​​​ ​Then Marine Pirate's Flyer Circulation.​ ​​

592
00:21:04,313 --> 00:21:06,482
​​​ ​Finally, Polka-san on delivery.​ ​​

593
00:21:04,313 --> 00:21:06,048
​​​ ​"Flyer Circulation"?​ ​​

594
00:21:06,482 --> 00:21:07,883
​​​ ​She just fits the role.​ ​​

595
00:21:07,883 --> 00:21:11,087
​​​ ​She'd be like, "Here's yer order!"​ ​​

596
00:21:09,418 --> 00:21:11,087
​​​ ​I get what you mean!​ ​​

597
00:21:11,087 --> 00:21:13,689
​​​ ​That's why I...​ ​​

598
00:21:11,821 --> 00:21:14,924
​​​ ​She seems the type​ ​​
​​ ​to get the job done fast.​ ​​

599
00:21:14,156 --> 00:21:16,525
​​​ ​Exactly. So that was my reasoning.​ ​​

600
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,995
​​​ ​I see. What about you, Lui-san?​ ​​

601
00:21:18,995 --> 00:21:26,102
​​​ ​Well, I heard that Roboco-senpai cooks,​ ​​

602
00:21:26,102 --> 00:21:29,071
​​​ ​so I thought she'd be best for the kitchen.​ ​​

603
00:21:29,071 --> 00:21:34,744
​​​ ​Meanwhile, Polka-senpai seems like​ ​​
​​ ​she'd make a speedy delivery person.​ ​​

604
00:21:34,744 --> 00:21:38,581
​​​ ​Subaru-senpai is really energetic,​ ​​

605
00:21:38,581 --> 00:21:42,551
​​​ ​and having a loud voice is important​ ​​
​​ ​when handing out flyers​ ​​

606
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:46,489
​​​ ​in order to attract people's attention​ ​​
​​ ​and make them curious.​ ​​

607
00:21:44,253 --> 00:21:46,489
​​​ ​That's for sure!​ ​​

608
00:21:46,489 --> 00:21:48,924
​​​ ​And for the register...​ ​​

609
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:49,625
​​​ ​Great choices!​ ​​

610
00:21:48,924 --> 00:21:50,960
​​​ ​For the register...​ ​​

611
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,197
​​​ ​I think the friendly and talkative​ ​​
​​ ​Marine-senpai​ ​​

612
00:21:55,197 --> 00:21:59,335
​​​ ​would be a good person​ ​​
​​ ​to man the register.​ ​​

613
00:21:59,335 --> 00:22:00,436
​​​ ​I see.​ ​​

614
00:22:00,436 --> 00:22:05,308
​​​ ​I can definitely see​ ​​
​​ ​where you're coming from!​ ​​

615
00:22:05,308 --> 00:22:09,111
​​​ ​Let's see what my assignments were.​ ​​

616
00:22:09,111 --> 00:22:11,047
​​​ ​Here they are!​ ​​

617
00:22:11,047 --> 00:22:13,082
​​​ ​Ta-dah!​ ​​

618
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:15,251
​​​ ​What do you know!​ ​​

619
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:19,155
​​​ ​They match Laplus-chan's exactly!​ ​​

620
00:22:17,353 --> 00:22:18,621
​​​ ​Yay!​ ​​

621
00:22:19,155 --> 00:22:21,791
​​​ ​Congratulations!​ ​​

622
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,425
​​​ ​Nicely done!​ ​​

623
00:22:21,357 --> 00:22:23,559
​​​ ​I'm so good at this!​ ​​

624
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:28,798
​​​ ​I agree that having​ ​​
​​ ​Subaru-senpai at the register​ ​​

625
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:31,267
​​​ ​would put a smile on customers' faces.​ ​​

626
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:33,336
​​​ ​Plus, she seems very approachable.​ ​​

627
00:22:33,336 --> 00:22:37,273
​​​ ​Of course, the same goes for Marine-senpai.​ ​​

628
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:39,241
​​​ ​They both fit.​ ​​

629
00:22:39,241 --> 00:22:41,210
​​​ ​Yeah, very friendly.​ ​​

630
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:43,245
​​​ ​And Roboco-senpai​ ​​

631
00:22:43,245 --> 00:22:46,615
​​​ ​is very good at cooking, I believe,​ ​​

632
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:49,785
​​​ ​so I put her in the kitchen.​ ​​

633
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:53,856
​​​ ​As for why Marine-senpai​ ​​
​​ ​is on flyer duty,​ ​​

634
00:22:53,856 --> 00:22:56,425
​​​ ​I thought she could use her body...​ ​​

635
00:22:56,425 --> 00:22:59,829
​​​ ​Strike some sexy poses,​ ​​

636
00:22:59,829 --> 00:23:04,900
​​​ ​and people would be lining up​ ​​
​​ ​for those flyers.​ ​​

637
00:22:59,829 --> 00:23:01,163
​​​ ​Use that sex appeal.​ ​​

638
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,036
​​​ ​And finally, to round it out,​ ​​

639
00:23:07,036 --> 00:23:09,638
​​​ ​Polka-senpai on delivery duty.​ ​​

640
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:13,309
​​​ ​Reason being, she seems like she'd be quick,​ ​​

641
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:17,780
​​​ ​and energetic, and... like...​ ​​

642
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:20,783
​​​ ​At any rate, she's got initiative.​ ​​

643
00:23:20,449 --> 00:23:21,650
​​​ ​Agreed.​ ​​

644
00:23:20,783 --> 00:23:22,752
​​​ ​So she gets the job.​ ​​

645
00:23:22,752 --> 00:23:24,620
​​​ ​I bet she'd work very efficiently.​ ​​

646
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:28,657
​​​ ​So the person who passed​ ​​
​​ ​Manager Qualification #1​ ​​

647
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:32,128
​​​ ​is Laplus-san-chan...-san!​ ​​

648
00:23:31,026 --> 00:23:33,262
​​​ ​Wow!​ ​​

649
00:23:32,128 --> 00:23:34,597
​​​ ​Okay, which one are you calling me?​ ​​

650
00:23:34,597 --> 00:23:37,433
​​​ ​How about Lap-sama, instead?​ ​​

651
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:37,433
​​​ ​Oof.​ ​​

652
00:23:37,433 --> 00:23:38,701
​​​ ​Fine, Lap-chan it is.​ ​​

653
00:23:37,433 --> 00:23:39,902
​​​ ​Just go with "-chan."​ ​​

654
00:23:38,267 --> 00:23:41,270
​​​ ​Hey! Wait! How come?​ ​​

655
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,938
​​​ ​"Lap-chan" is fine.​ ​​

656
00:23:42,938 --> 00:23:46,075
​​​ ​Here's the next qualification!​ ​​

657
00:23:45,641 --> 00:23:46,742
​​​ ​Hope I win this time!​ ​​

658
00:23:46,742 --> 00:23:49,845
​​​ ​Manager Qualification #2: Memory!​ ​​

659
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:50,579
​​​ ​Uh-oh.​ ​​

660
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:52,748
​​​ ​As a KFP employee,​ ​​
​​ ​you gotta remember the menu​ ​​

661
00:23:52,748 --> 00:23:55,751
​​​ ​and the customers' orders.​ ​​

662
00:23:55,751 --> 00:23:58,654
​​​ ​So a good memory is essential!​ ​​

663
00:23:58,654 --> 00:24:01,090
​​​ ​So for your next task,​ ​​

664
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:05,094
​​​ ​you will be shown a short clip​ ​​
​​ ​of a hamburger.​ ​​

665
00:24:05,094 --> 00:24:07,830
​​​ ​You'll have to memorize the order​ ​​

666
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:10,599
​​​ ​of the ingredients in the hamburger,​ ​​

667
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:14,403
​​​ ​but you have only ten seconds to do so!​ ​​

668
00:24:14,403 --> 00:24:17,206
​​​ ​Can you remember it all in ten seconds?​ ​​

669
00:24:14,804 --> 00:24:15,805
​​​ ​Okay.​ ​​

670
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:18,574
​​​ ​Ten seconds...​ ​​

671
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:18,574
​​​ ​I'll sure try!​ ​​

672
00:24:18,574 --> 00:24:19,508
​​​ ​And with that,​ ​​

673
00:24:19,508 --> 00:24:23,345
​​​ ​let's see the first burger!​ ​​

674
00:24:22,011 --> 00:24:23,345
​​​ ​Let's see it!​ ​​

675
00:24:25,948 --> 00:24:27,049
​​​ ​There it is.​ ​​

676
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:32,788
​​​ ​Meat... meat... and...​ ​​

677
00:24:32,788 --> 00:24:34,723
​​​ ​Got it!​ ​​

678
00:24:34,123 --> 00:24:36,659
​​​ ​And no taking notes!​ ​​

679
00:24:35,991 --> 00:24:36,859
​​​ ​Let me go!​ ​​

680
00:24:36,859 --> 00:24:38,527
​​​ ​Let me say it, quick!​ ​​

681
00:24:38,527 --> 00:24:40,095
​​​ ​Go ahead, Laplus-san!​ ​​

682
00:24:40,095 --> 00:24:41,730
​​​ ​Um, bread, ketchup,​ ​​

683
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,933
​​​ ​lettuce, meat, meat, bread.​ ​​

684
00:24:45,134 --> 00:24:46,402
​​​ ​Same here.​ ​​

685
00:24:45,468 --> 00:24:47,436
​​​ ​Same for you, Lui-san?​ ​​

686
00:24:47,436 --> 00:24:50,072
​​​ ​Bun, ketchup, lettuce,​ ​​

687
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:53,209
​​​ ​patty, patty, and bun.​ ​​

688
00:24:53,209 --> 00:24:56,145
​​​ ​Okay, then let's have a look!​ ​​

689
00:24:56,145 --> 00:24:57,413
​​​ ​The answer is...​ ​​

690
00:24:57,413 --> 00:25:00,216
​​​ ​Bread, ketchup...​ ​​

691
00:24:58,481 --> 00:25:00,783
​​​ ​Bun, ketchup, lettuce,​ ​​

692
00:25:00,783 --> 00:25:05,087
​​​ ​meat, meat, lettuce, and bun!​ ​​

693
00:25:03,652 --> 00:25:05,821
​​​ ​Yay!​ ​​

694
00:25:05,821 --> 00:25:07,923
​​​ ​Nicely done!​ ​​

695
00:25:06,489 --> 00:25:07,923
​​​ ​You could hire me now!​ ​​

696
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,158
​​​ ​I didn't Lui-ve anything out!​ ​​

697
00:25:09,158 --> 00:25:10,593
​​​ ​Hire you? Well, I dunno...​ ​​

698
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:13,095
​​​ ​I don't think this is enough.​ ​​

699
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,095
​​​ ​I'm ready!​ ​​

700
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:15,231
​​​ ​I think we need another test, at least.​ ​​

701
00:25:15,231 --> 00:25:16,632
​​​ ​Then let's do another one!​ ​​

702
00:25:16,632 --> 00:25:17,900
​​​ ​Is this one harder?​ ​​

703
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:21,871
​​​ ​The person who ordered​ ​​
​​ ​this next burger was quite hungry.​ ​​

704
00:25:21,871 --> 00:25:27,309
​​​ ​Now, let's see​ ​​
​​ ​the next and final burger!​ ​​

705
00:25:30,713 --> 00:25:32,081
​​​ ​Whoa!​ ​​

706
00:25:31,514 --> 00:25:32,681
​​​ ​Ahh, I can't do this!​ ​​

707
00:25:35,851 --> 00:25:38,087
​​​ ​Okay, think I've got it.​ ​​

708
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:42,057
​​​ ​Let me go first!​ ​​

709
00:25:41,357 --> 00:25:43,993
​​​ ​Okay, then, Laplus-san!​ ​​

710
00:25:42,057 --> 00:25:43,993
​​​ ​What? Hey!​ ​​

711
00:25:43,993 --> 00:25:45,461
​​​ ​Let's say it together.​ ​​

712
00:25:45,027 --> 00:25:47,229
​​​ ​Then please, say it together.​ ​​

713
00:25:47,229 --> 00:25:48,931
​​​ ​Ready, and...​ ​​

714
00:25:48,931 --> 00:25:50,733
​​​ ​Bread, ketchup,​ ​​

715
00:25:48,931 --> 00:25:51,333
​​​ ​Bread, ketchup,​ ​​

716
00:25:50,733 --> 00:25:53,002
​​​ ​lettuce, tomato,​ ​​

717
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:53,335
​​​ ​lettuce, tomato,​ ​​

718
00:25:53,002 --> 00:25:55,104
​​​ ​cheese, ketchup,​ ​​

719
00:25:53,335 --> 00:25:55,471
​​​ ​ketchup, cheese,​ ​​

720
00:25:55,104 --> 00:25:55,838
​​​ ​meat, bread.​ ​​

721
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:56,505
​​​ ​meat...​ ​​

722
00:25:55,838 --> 00:25:57,172
​​​ ​Wait, those two are switched.​ ​​

723
00:25:57,172 --> 00:25:58,874
​​​ ​Oh, somebody must be wrong.​ ​​

724
00:25:58,874 --> 00:26:00,109
​​​ ​Tomato...​ ​​

725
00:25:58,874 --> 00:26:02,511
​​​ ​Ketchup... Tomato, ketchup,​ ​​
​​ ​cheese, meat?​ ​​

726
00:26:02,511 --> 00:26:05,714
​​​ ​I said tomato, cheese, ketchup.​ ​​

727
00:26:05,714 --> 00:26:06,649
​​​ ​I think.​ ​​

728
00:26:06,248 --> 00:26:08,284
​​​ ​Then we disagree there.​ ​​

729
00:26:08,284 --> 00:26:12,021
​​​ ​This is the deciding moment, then.​ ​​

730
00:26:09,418 --> 00:26:10,753
​​​ ​So who's right?​ ​​

731
00:26:10,753 --> 00:26:12,021
​​​ ​Which way is it?​ ​​

732
00:26:12,021 --> 00:26:14,924
​​​ ​Let's take a look!​ ​​

733
00:26:14,056 --> 00:26:14,924
​​​ ​Okay!​ ​​

734
00:26:14,924 --> 00:26:15,758
​​​ ​Here it is!​ ​​

735
00:26:17,793 --> 00:26:20,529
​​​ ​Bun, ketchup, lettuce, tomato,​ ​​

736
00:26:20,529 --> 00:26:24,667
​​​ ​ketchup, cheese, beef, and bun!​ ​​

737
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,001
​​​ ​Yay!​ ​​

738
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:26,268
​​​ ​I had it backwards!​ ​​

739
00:26:26,268 --> 00:26:29,905
​​​ ​Lui-san, welcome to KFP.​ ​​

740
00:26:28,771 --> 00:26:29,905
​​​ ​Thank you.​ ​​

741
00:26:29,905 --> 00:26:31,607
​​​ ​What about me?!​ ​​

742
00:26:31,607 --> 00:26:32,775
​​​ ​Glad to join the team.​ ​​

743
00:26:32,775 --> 00:26:34,076
​​​ ​Hey! Not so fast!​ ​​

744
00:26:34,076 --> 00:26:37,947
​​​ ​W-Well, we can let her do the cleaning.​ ​​

745
00:26:37,947 --> 00:26:39,648
​​​ ​I dunno about cleaning...​ ​​

746
00:26:39,648 --> 00:26:41,483
​​​ ​Me and cleaning don't get along well...​ ​​

747
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:42,084
​​​ ​But you'll have a job.​ ​​

748
00:26:41,483 --> 00:26:43,786
​​​ ​Cleaning is important, too!​ ​​

749
00:26:43,786 --> 00:26:45,654
​​​ ​Cleaning just isn't my thing...​ ​​

750
00:26:43,786 --> 00:26:47,623
​​​ ​Lives in a pigsty​ ​​

751
00:26:45,654 --> 00:26:47,623
​​​ ​Perfect opportunity to improve!​ ​​

752
00:26:47,823 --> 00:26:49,091
​​​ ​And that's that.​ ​​

753
00:26:49,091 --> 00:26:53,862
​​​ ​What did you all think​ ​​
​​ ​of today's program?​ ​​

754
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,397
​​​ ​Well, gosh...​ ​​

755
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,864
​​​ ​I had fun!​ ​​

756
00:26:55,397 --> 00:26:59,435
​​​ ​With Kiara-senpai joining us,​ ​​

757
00:26:59,435 --> 00:27:02,171
​​​ ​she really added something new to the mix.​ ​​

758
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,171
​​​ ​Totally!​ ​​

759
00:27:02,171 --> 00:27:06,575
​​​ ​Every time the members rotate,​ ​​
​​ ​it really changes up the show!​ ​​

760
00:27:06,575 --> 00:27:07,943
​​​ ​It's really nice.​ ​​

761
00:27:07,943 --> 00:27:10,913
​​​ ​You're gonna be MC next time, XO.​ ​​

762
00:27:07,943 --> 00:27:09,612
​​​ ​How about you, Kiara-senpai?​ ​​

763
00:27:10,913 --> 00:27:11,947
​​​ ​Oh, right.​ ​​

764
00:27:11,947 --> 00:27:13,682
​​​ ​Good luck.​ ​​

765
00:27:14,717 --> 00:27:17,086
​​​ ​I'll do my best as MC.​ ​​

766
00:27:17,086 --> 00:27:20,756
​​​ ​Let's have another good show, Kiara-senpai.​ ​​

767
00:27:20,756 --> 00:27:24,293
​​​ ​Right! Well, today's show was...​ ​​

768
00:27:24,293 --> 00:27:27,229
​​​ ​I was a little nervous,​ ​​

769
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:30,766
​​​ ​but I think I nailed it​ ​​

770
00:27:30,766 --> 00:27:34,970
​​​ ​throughout today's games and quizzes,​ ​​

771
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:38,707
​​​ ​so I think I'll perform​ ​​
​​ ​just as perfectly next time.​ ​​

772
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:38,107
​​​ ​Perfectly!​ ​​

773
00:27:38,707 --> 00:27:40,442
​​​ ​We're counting on you!​ ​​

774
00:27:38,707 --> 00:27:41,076
​​​ ​It was lots of fun!​ ​​

775
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:43,245
​​​ ​And a job well done, La+!​ ​​

776
00:27:42,778 --> 00:27:44,380
​​​ ​Good job!​ ​​

777
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:44,980
​​​ ​Three weeks in a row.​ ​​

778
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,315
​​​ ​Oh, that's right.​ ​​

779
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:46,749
​​​ ​Wait, not three weeks.​ ​​

780
00:27:46,315 --> 00:27:49,685
​​​ ​Guys, this is my last appearance!​ ​​

781
00:27:48,751 --> 00:27:51,053
​​​ ​I meant three times in a row.​ ​​

782
00:27:49,685 --> 00:27:51,053
​​​ ​This is farewell!​ ​​

783
00:27:51,053 --> 00:27:53,522
​​​ ​How sad!​ ​​

784
00:27:53,522 --> 00:27:54,857
​​​ ​Can you make it home yourself?​ ​​

785
00:27:54,857 --> 00:27:56,025
​​​ ​Wait, for real?​ ​​

786
00:27:56,025 --> 00:27:57,259
​​​ ​Um, yes, I can!​ ​​

787
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:59,895
​​​ ​In fact, I'm outta here.​ ​​

788
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:58,627
​​​ ​So cute.​ ​​

789
00:27:59,895 --> 00:28:03,565
​​​ ​This has been La+ Darknesss...​ ​​

790
00:28:03,565 --> 00:28:05,634
​​​ ​Takane Lui...​ ​​

791
00:28:05,634 --> 00:28:08,804
​​​ ​...and Taka<i>nashi </i>Kiara!​ ​​

792
00:28:08,804 --> 00:28:11,573
​​​ ​See you all! Bye-bye!​ ​​

793
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:13,776
​​​ ​See you next time!​ ​​

794
00:28:11,573 --> 00:28:15,411
​​​ ​See you! Bye-bye!​ ​​
