know how but didn't go for it

950
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:10,220

951
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:14,470
know how but didn't go for it
I would have yeah but you got it nice

952
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:14,480
I would have yeah but you got it nice
 

953
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:19,450

00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:19,460

 

955
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,889

yeah I know that I think about it she

956
00:29:21,889 --> 00:29:21,899
yeah I know that I think about it she
 

957
00:29:21,899 --> 00:29:23,510
yeah I know that I think about it she
really doesn't but it surprised me like

958
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:23,520
really doesn't but it surprised me like
 

959
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,070
really doesn't but it surprised me like
like even if you don't do anything say

960
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:25,080
like even if you don't do anything say
 

961
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,330
like even if you don't do anything say
so it doesn't necessarily mean that

962
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:26,340
so it doesn't necessarily mean that
 

963
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:29,450
so it doesn't necessarily mean that
you're considered as uh you must do
