intentionally uh I have one
 

1555
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:29,230
intentionally uh I have one
uh suggestion although I think it

1556
00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:29,240
uh suggestion although I think it
 

1557
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:31,349
uh suggestion although I think it
depends on the monitor on on one of my

1558
00:57:31,349 --> 00:57:31,359
depends on the monitor on on one of my
 

1559
00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:33,390
depends on the monitor on on one of my
monitors the colors look pretty much the

1560
00:57:33,390 --> 00:57:33,400
monitors the colors look pretty much the
 

1561
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:36,750
monitors the colors look pretty much the
same on the others s uh very different

1562
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:36,760
same on the others s uh very different
 

1563
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:39,470
same on the others s uh very different
but like maybe we can light up the space

1564
00:57:39,470 --> 00:57:39,480
but like maybe we can light up the space
 

1565
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:41,190
but like maybe we can light up the space
somewhere I don't know or or we should

1566
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:41,200
somewhere I don't know or or we should
 

1567
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:44,430
somewhere I don't know or or we should
like the blocks you know like just just

1568
00:57:44,430 --> 00:57:44,440
like the blocks you know like just just
 

1569
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:46,950
like the blocks you know like just just
use the red block

1570
00:57:46,950 --> 00:57:46,960
use the red block
 

1571
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,829
use the red block
and red block maybe we'll use a more

1572
00:57:49,829 --> 00:57:49,839
and red block maybe we'll use a more
 

1573
00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:51,309
and red block maybe we'll use a more
contrasting block yeah I think that

1574
00:57:51,309 --> 00:57:51,319
contrasting block yeah I think that
 

1575
00:57:51,319 --> 00:57:54,349
contrasting block yeah I think that
would help yeah like maybe we can avoid

1576
00:57:54,349 --> 00:57:54,359
would help yeah like maybe we can avoid
 

1577
00:57:54,359 --> 00:57:57,630
would help yeah like maybe we can avoid

practicing this game a lot or if they

1656
01:00:12,990 --> 01:00:13,000
practicing this game a lot or if they
 

1657
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,390
practicing this game a lot or if they
also just did it one time and then call

1710
01:01:15,670 --> 01:01:15,680
those three
 

1711
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:17,990
those three
rounds what the

1712
01:01:17,990 --> 01:01:18,000
rounds what the
 

1713
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,150
rounds what the
H yeah to be a lot more chaotic than we

1714
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:22,160
H yeah to be a lot more chaotic than we
 

1715
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:24,549
H yeah to be a lot more chaotic than we
thought at the same time I feel like

1716
01:01:24,549 --> 01:01:24,559
thought at the same time I feel like
 

1717
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:26,710
thought at the same time I feel like
people will fall down immediately

1718
01:01:26,710 --> 01:01:26,720
people will fall down immediately
 

1719
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:33,390
people will fall down immediately
yeah I think it's just like kind of

1720
01:01:33,390 --> 01:01:33,400

 

1721
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:38,300

bed it's pretty luck based there's three

1722
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:38,310

 

1723
01:01:38,310 --> 01:01:41,829

[Music]

1724
01:01:41,829 --> 01:01:41,839

 

1725
01:01:41,839 --> 01:01:47,950

rounds only

1726
01:01:47,950 --> 01:01:47,960

 

1727
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:51,670

only somebody falls down first uh versus

1728
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:51,680
only somebody falls down first uh versus
 

1729
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:54,589
only somebody falls down first uh versus
somebody who falls down third do the do

1730
01:01:54,589 --> 01:01:54,599
somebody who falls down third do the do
 

1731
01:01:54,599 --> 01:01:57,069
somebody who falls down third do the do
the third ones on who fell down third

1732
01:01:57,069 --> 01:01:57,079
the third ones on who fell down third
 

1733
01:01:57,079 --> 01:01:59,069
the third ones on who fell down third
get more

1734
01:01:59,069 --> 01:01:59,079
get more
 

1735
01:01:59,079 --> 01:02:03,710
get more
emeralds

1736
01:02:03,710 --> 01:02:03,720

 

1737
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,510

um like it would matter probably right

1738
01:02:06,510 --> 01:02:06,520
um like it would matter probably right
 

1739
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:10,670
um like it would matter probably right
uh who who fell down first they get

1740
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:10,680
uh who who fell down first they get
 

1741
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:13,430
uh who who fell down first they get
emeralds I wonder yeah you're I

1742
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:13,440
emeralds I wonder yeah you're I
 

1743
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:15,630
emeralds I wonder yeah you're I
hearing yeah and then I guess so if

1744
01:02:15,630 --> 01:02:15,640
hearing yeah and then I guess so if
 

1745
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:17,269
hearing yeah and then I guess so if
somebody Falls they have to immediately

1746
01:02:17,269 --> 01:02:17,279
somebody Falls they have to immediately
 

1747
01:02:17,279 --> 01:02:22,750
somebody Falls they have to immediately
announce like for example pavoni P

1748
01:02:22,750 --> 01:02:22,760

 

1749
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:26,670

out yeah it becomes easier for the

1750
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:26,680
out yeah it becomes easier for the
 

1751
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:29,109
out yeah it becomes easier for the
organizer yeah I think with so much

1752
01:02:29,109 --> 01:02:29,119
organizer yeah I think with so much
 

1753
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:30,910
organizer yeah I think with so much
going on I wouldn't if I was at the top

1754
01:02:30,910 --> 01:02:30,920
going on I wouldn't if I was at the top
 

1755
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:32,910
going on I wouldn't if I was at the top
I wouldn't even notice h no if I was at

1756
01:02:32,910 --> 01:02:32,920
I wouldn't even notice h no if I was at
 

1757
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:34,349
I wouldn't even notice h no if I was at
the bottom I might not even notice when

1758
01:02:34,349 --> 01:02:34,359
the bottom I might not even notice when
 

1759
01:02:34,359 --> 01:02:36,230
the bottom I might not even notice when
you fall down immediately and I might

1760
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:36,240
you fall down immediately and I might
 

1761
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:39,710
you fall down immediately and I might
still be digging holes so only the last

1762
01:02:39,710 --> 01:02:39,720
still be digging holes so only the last
 

1763
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:44,630
still be digging holes so only the last
one standing gets the

1764
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:44,640

 

1765
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:47,910

emerald threee rounds and then

1766
01:02:47,910 --> 01:02:47,920
emerald threee rounds and then
 

1767
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:50,710
emerald threee rounds and then
okay so only threee pairs out of six

1768
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:50,720
okay so only threee pairs out of six
 

1769
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:53,910
okay so only threee pairs out of six
pairs can even get points yeah so it's

1770
01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:53,920
pairs can even get points yeah so it's
 

1771
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:55,589
pairs can even get points yeah so it's
always only the last man standing gets

1772
01:02:55,589 --> 01:02:55,599
always only the last man standing gets
 

1773
01:02:55,599 --> 01:02:57,510
always only the last man standing gets
points point so if even if you finish

1774
01:02:57,510 --> 01:02:57,520
points point so if even if you finish
 

1775
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:02,549
points point so if even if you finish
second you don't get

1776
01:03:02,549 --> 01:03:02,559

01:03:26,510 --> 01:03:26,520
are contrasting to each other but then
 

1797
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:28,349
are contrasting to each other but then
if there's going to be three going on at

1798
01:03:28,349 --> 01:03:28,359
if there's going to be three going on at
 

1799
01:03:28,359 --> 01:03:30,430
if there's going to be three going on at
the same time right cuz it's like is it

1800
01:03:30,430 --> 01:03:30,440
the same time right cuz it's like is it
 

1801
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:33,750
the same time right cuz it's like is it
six teams or two teams or yeah so we

1802
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:33,760
six teams or two teams or yeah so we
 

1803
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:35,710
six teams or two teams or yeah so we
need six colors that means there's no

1804
01:03:35,710 --> 01:03:35,720
need six colors that means there's no
 

1805
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:37,549
need six colors that means there's no
way there's going to be there's

1806
01:03:37,549 --> 01:03:37,559
way there's going to be there's
 

1807
01:03:37,559 --> 01:03:40,150
way there's going to be there's
definitely going to be weird a the low

1808
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:40,160
definitely going to be weird a the low
 

1809
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:42,109
definitely going to be weird a the low
contrast colors next to each other which

1810
01:03:42,109 --> 01:03:42,119
contrast colors next to each other which
 

1811
01:03:42,119 --> 01:03:43,750
contrast colors next to each other which
was K it's okay I just have to look at

1812
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:43,760
was K it's okay I just have to look at
 

1813
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,990
was K it's okay I just have to look at
my other monitor okay okay then okay I

1814
01:03:45,990 --> 01:03:46,000
my other monitor okay okay then okay I
 

1815
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,150
my other monitor okay okay then okay I
was I just wanted to clear it up it's

1816
01:03:48,150 --> 01:03:48,160
was I just wanted to clear it up it's
 

1817
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:49,549
was I just wanted to clear it up it's
just cuz it's darker down here when I

1818
01:03:49,549 --> 01:03:49,559
just cuz it's darker down here when I
 

1819
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:51,670
just cuz it's darker down here when I
was at the top it wasn't although we use

1820
01:03:51,670 --> 01:03:51,680
was at the top it wasn't although we use
 

1821
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,309
was at the top it wasn't although we use
different colors at the top but I think

1822
01:03:53,309 --> 01:03:53,319
different colors at the top but I think
 

1823
01:03:53,319 --> 01:03:55,829
different colors at the top but I think
it's darker down here ah so maybe

1824
01:03:55,829 --> 01:03:55,839
it's darker down here ah so maybe
 

1825
01:03:55,839 --> 01:03:57,390
it's darker down here ah so maybe
lighting will help more lighting down

1826
01:03:57,390 --> 01:03:57,400
lighting will help more lighting down
 

1827
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:00,309
lighting will help more lighting down
here a little bit honestly yeah I think

1828
01:04:00,309 --> 01:04:00,319
here a little bit honestly yeah I think
 

1829
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:02,870
here a little bit honestly yeah I think
uh but it's hard because like you can't

1830
01:04:02,870 --> 01:04:02,880
uh but it's hard because like you can't
 

1831
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,190
uh but it's hard because like you can't
put anything you guys won't be able to

1832
01:04:05,190 --> 01:04:05,200
put anything you guys won't be able to
 

1833
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,309
put anything you guys won't be able to
uh yeah you guys won't be able to cut

1834
01:04:07,309 --> 01:04:07,319
uh yeah you guys won't be able to cut
 

1835
01:04:07,319 --> 01:04:08,870
uh yeah you guys won't be able to cut
it's okay I I will look at my other

it's okay I I will look at my other
 

1837
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,829
it's okay I I will look at my other
monitor but we should tell the other

go to the center or what yeah that I

2454
01:24:04,669 --> 01:24:04,679

2455
01:24:04,679 --> 01:24:07,229
go to the center or what yeah that I
want to know that too yeah yeah no but

2456
01:24:07,229 --> 01:24:07,239
want to know that too yeah yeah no but
 

2457
01:24:07,239 --> 01:24:09,070

she did say that the last one standing

2458
01:24:09,070 --> 01:24:09,080
she did say that the last one standing
 

2459
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:11,950
she did say that the last one standing
wins so maybe not necessarily going to

2460
01:24:11,950 --> 01:24:11,960
wins so maybe not necessarily going to
 

2461
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:14,870
wins so maybe not necessarily going to
the center just surviving but honestly

2462
01:24:14,870 --> 01:24:14,880
the center just surviving but honestly
 

2463
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:18,350
the center just surviving but honestly
we can't really um go that far because

2464
01:24:18,350 --> 01:24:18,360
we can't really um go that far because
 

2465
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:19,709
we can't really um go that far because
then you wouldn't be able to see

2466
01:24:19,709 --> 01:24:19,719
then you wouldn't be able to see
 

2467
01:24:19,719 --> 01:24:22,110
then you wouldn't be able to see
anything yeah that's what I was thinking

2468
01:24:22,110 --> 01:24:22,120
anything yeah that's what I was thinking
 

2469
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:25,310
anything yeah that's what I was thinking
so maybe we should like sort of stay

2470
01:24:25,310 --> 01:24:25,320
so maybe we should like sort of stay
 

2471
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:27,790
so maybe we should like sort of stay
yeah well but then they know that

2472
01:24:27,790 --> 01:24:27,800
yeah well but then they know that
 

2473
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:29,470
yeah well but then they know that
they'll maybe see oh they're always in

2474
01:24:29,470 --> 01:24:29,480
they'll maybe see oh they're always in
 

2475
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:31,709
they'll maybe see oh they're always in
their own territory so they just go to

2476
01:24:31,709 --> 01:24:31,719
their own territory so they just go to
 

2477
01:24:31,719 --> 01:24:34,270
their own territory so they just go to
our territory to fight us that's what

2478
01:24:34,270 --> 01:24:34,280
our territory to fight us that's what
 

2479
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:35,990
our territory to fight us that's what
I'm thinking you know like if you

2480
01:24:35,990 --> 01:24:36,000
I'm thinking you know like if you
 

2481
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,189
I'm thinking you know like if you
there's there's only so much you can see

2482
01:24:38,189 --> 01:24:38,199
there's there's only so much you can see
 

2483
01:24:38,199 --> 01:24:39,910
there's there's only so much you can see
but it's also hard for them to see yeah

2484
01:24:39,910 --> 01:24:39,920
but it's also hard for them to see yeah
 

2485
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:42,229
but it's also hard for them to see yeah
for the others not just for us but I'm

2486
01:24:42,229 --> 01:24:42,239
for the others not just for us but I'm
 

2487
01:24:42,239 --> 01:24:43,709
for the others not just for us but I'm
just thinking like at some point the

2488
01:24:43,709 --> 01:24:43,719
just thinking like at some point the
 

2489
01:24:43,719 --> 01:24:45,590
just thinking like at some point the
Navigator wouldn't be able to do

2490
01:24:45,590 --> 01:24:45,600
Navigator wouldn't be able to do
 

2491
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:47,390
Navigator wouldn't be able to do
anything

2492
01:24:47,390 --> 01:24:47,400
anything
 

2493
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:52,510
anything
mhm no armor Weapon by what I don't

2494
01:24:52,510 --> 01:24:52,520
mhm no armor Weapon by what I don't
 

2495
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:56,390
mhm no armor Weapon by what I don't
know m I also I only can tell there's

2496
01:24:56,390 --> 01:24:56,400
know m I also I only can tell there's
 

2497
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:59,629
know m I also I only can tell there's
another place there but this is like

2498
01:24:59,629 --> 01:24:59,639
another place there but this is like
 

2499
01:24:59,639 --> 01:25:01,790
another place there but this is like
probably I see one there but it's too

2500
01:25:01,790 --> 01:25:01,800
probably I see one there but it's too
 

2501
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:04,550
probably I see one there but it's too
far really and I don't know and I think

2502
01:25:04,550 --> 01:25:04,560
far really and I don't know and I think
 

2503
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:08,189
far really and I don't know and I think
like uh MAA said no armor weapon buy so

happens just I think going to the middle
is very

3154
01:44:08,470 --> 01:44:08,480
is very
 

3155
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:12,270
is very
bad yeah yeah and I just straight up get

3156
01:44:12,270 --> 01:44:12,280
bad yeah yeah and I just straight up get
 

3157

bad yeah yeah and I just straight up get
third

3158
01:44:13,229 --> 01:44:13,239
third
 

3159
01:44:13,239 --> 01:44:15,510
third
parted yeah maybe better than but

3160
01:44:15,510 --> 01:44:15,520
parted yeah maybe better than but
 

3161
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:17,310
parted yeah maybe better than but
anyways it's just a simulation it's

3162
01:44:17,310 --> 01:44:17,320
anyways it's just a simulation it's
 

3163
01:44:17,320 --> 01:44:18,990
anyways it's just a simulation it's
whatever

3164
01:44:18,990 --> 01:44:19,000
whatever
 

3165
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,990
whatever
yeah well now it was so much harder to

3166
01:44:21,990 --> 01:44:22,000
yeah well now it was so much harder to
 

3167
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:25,189
yeah well now it was so much harder to
get sort of simple

3168
01:44:25,189 --> 01:44:25,199

 

3169
01:44:25,199 --> 01:44:29,149

but anyways it's fine just just

3170
01:44:29,149 --> 01:44:29,159
but anyways it's fine just just
 

3171
01:44:29,159 --> 01:44:33,229
but anyways it's fine just just
testing I wish I could see

3172
01:44:33,229 --> 01:44:33,239

 

3173
01:44:33,239 --> 01:44:35,830

better the UI didn't make the names

3174
01:44:35,830 --> 01:44:35,840
better the UI didn't make the names
 

3175
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:36,790
better the UI didn't make the names
bigger

3176
01:44:36,790 --> 01:44:36,800
bigger
 

3177
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:40,430
bigger
either uh I like an accessibility like

3178
01:44:40,430 --> 01:44:40,440
either uh I like an accessibility like
 

3179
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:42,510
either uh I like an accessibility like
setting or something no it doesn't make

3180
01:44:42,510 --> 01:44:42,520
setting or something no it doesn't make
 

3181
01:44:42,520 --> 01:44:43,990
setting or something no it doesn't make
it bigger you can make the UI bigger but

3182
01:44:43,990 --> 01:44:44,000
it bigger you can make the UI bigger but
 

3183
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:47,629
it bigger you can make the UI bigger but
it doesn't make the names bigger test

3184
01:44:47,629 --> 01:44:47,639
it doesn't make the names bigger test
 

3185
01:44:47,639 --> 01:44:50,629
it doesn't make the names bigger test
