where I wanted to play a game that was

1365
00:47:59,069 --> 00:47:59,079
where I wanted to play a game that was
 

1366
00:47:59,079 --> 00:48:01,470
where I wanted to play a game that was
only available in like the US region or

1367
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:01,480
only available in like the US region or
 

1368
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:05,270
only available in like the US region or
so I think so I had to

1369
00:48:05,270 --> 00:48:05,280
so I think so I had to
 

1370
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,670
so I think so I had to
switch to a different count but then I

1371
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:08,680
switch to a different count but then I
 

1372
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,109
switch to a different count but then I
don't know I had all kinds of problems I

1373
00:48:10,109 --> 00:48:10,119
don't know I had all kinds of problems I
 

1374
