4818
03:11:12,479 --> 03:11:19,550

Well, I have to make a potion. I was

4819
03:11:19,550 --> 03:11:21,469

 

4820
03:11:21,469 --> 03:11:21,479

 

4821
03:11:21,479 --> 03:11:31,750

really surprised when I made the potion. I was also fired up.

4822
03:11:31,750 --> 03:11:31,760

guys said we don't have a roof, so let's
 

4827
03:11:41,439 --> 03:11:44,070
guys said we don't have a roof, so let's
build one.

4828
03:11:44,070 --> 03:11:44,080
build one.
 

4829
03:11:44,080 --> 03:11:49,309
build one.
But even if we build a roof, we won't be able

4830
03:11:49,309 --> 03:11:49,319
But even if we build a roof, we won't be able
 

4831
03:11:49,319 --> 03:11:52,670
But even if we build a roof, we won't be able
to get in, so let's

4832
03:11:52,670 --> 03:12:00,950
to get in, so let's
 

4833
03:12:00,950 --> 03:12:11,070

 

4834
03:12:11,070 --> 03:12:11,080

 

4835
03:12:11,080 --> 03:12:18,190

build it like this. Hey, if it's like this, we can climb it. Well, we can climb it with this. It's

4836
03:12:18,190 --> 03:12:18,200

4838
03:12:20,630 --> 03:12:20,640

 

4839
03:12:20,640 --> 03:12:24,750

fine. It's great. I don't

4840
03:12:24,750 --> 03:12:24,760
fine. It's great. I don't
 

4841
03:12:24,760 --> 03:12:27,870
fine. It's great. I don't
feel like this.

4842
03:12:27,870 --> 03:12:27,880
feel like this.
 

4843
03:12:27,880 --> 03:12:34,150
feel like this.
The ceiling is a bit low.  It's already low.

4844
03:12:34,150 --> 03:12:34,160

 

4845
03:12:34,160 --> 03:12:42,750


4846
03:12:42,750 --> 03:12:42,760

 

4847
03:12:42,760 --> 03:12:47,870

The ceiling is low, so my body should have a high ceiling.

4848
03:12:47,870 --> 03:12:47,880
The ceiling is low, so my body should have a high ceiling.
 

4849
03:12:47,880 --> 03:12:48,990
The ceiling is low, so my body should have a high ceiling.

4850
03:12:48,990 --> 03:12:49,000

 

4851
03:12:49,000 --> 03:12:52,910


4852
03:12:52,910 --> 03:12:52,920

 

4853
03:12:52,920 --> 03:12:56,269

Ah, the ceiling is so low that I

4854
03:12:56,269 --> 03:13:00,830
Ah, the ceiling is so low that I
 

4855
03:13:00,830 --> 03:13:00,840

 

4856
03:13:00,840 --> 03:13:07,070

have to live with the awareness that my head is always hitting the ceiling.

4857
03:13:07,070 --> 03:13:07,080

 

4858
03:13:07,080 --> 03:13:17,710

Well, that's no good. What should I do? I've come up with a better

4859
03:13:17,710 --> 03:13:19,389

 

4860
03:13:19,389 --> 03:13:19,399

 

4861
03:13:19,399 --> 03:13:27,550

4864
03:13:29,920 --> 03:13:35,070

seems that the appearance of the octopus enhances imagination. I

4865
03:13:35,070 --> 03:13:35,080
seems that the appearance of the octopus enhances imagination. I
 

4866
03:13:35,080 --> 03:13:38,229
seems that the appearance of the octopus enhances imagination. I
can't enter this door. I

4867
03:13:38,229 --> 03:13:41,190

'm going to enter from here. So I'm going to open it. Perfection is back.

5614
03:50:17,239 --> 03:50:27,349

Well, I'm

5636
03:51:31,770 --> 03:51:31,780

5648
03:52:11,389 --> 03:52:11,399
don't have any nether wart to put the ingredients in. I
 

5649
03:52:11,399 --> 03:52:21,469
don't have any nether wart to put the ingredients in. I
guess it's impossible to make a potion. I guess

03:52:21,469 --> 03:52:21,479

 

5651
03:52:21,479 --> 03:52:27,389

5724
03:55:28,309 --> 03:55:35,030

good? I don't know about TTT. I don't
 

5728
03:55:38,399 --> 03:55:40,550

know either, so I didn't write about it,

5729
03:55:40,550 --> 03:55:40,560
know either, so I didn't write about it,
 

5730
03:55:40,560 --> 03:55:43,110
know either, so I didn't write about it,
but the skeletons are over there.  If it's a skeleton, then it's

5731
03:55:43,110 --> 03:55:44,990
but the skeletons are over there.  If it's a skeleton, then it's

done, so it's probably okay,
 

5737
03:55:50,920 --> 03:55:53,990

6166
04:16:22,880 --> 04:16:25,750

n't it okay to not give back even if you don't give back? Even if you don't give back, you can give back even if you don't.  It

6167
04:16:25,750 --> 04:16:25,760
n't it okay to not give back even if you don't give back? Even if you don't give back, you can give back even if you don't.  It

6170
04:16:30,199 --> 04:16:35,750

date is written is strange.Let's

6171
04:16:35,750 --> 04:16:35,760
date is written is strange.Let's
 

6172
04:16:35,760 --> 04:16:39,109
date is written is strange.Let's
match.I'm the type to match things like this.So, it was

6173
04:16:39,109 --> 04:16:39,119
match.I'm the type to match things like this.So, it was
 

6174
04:16:39,119 --> 04:16:51,990
match.I'm the type to match things like this.So, it was
May 16th,

6175
04:16:51,990 --> 04:16:52,000

 

6176
04:16:52,000 --> 04:16:57,189

so I guess this one makes more sense.Hmm, do

6177
04:16:57,189 --> 04:17:01,309

 

6178
04:17:01,309 --> 04:17:01,319

6181
04:17:04,800 --> 04:17:13,590
n't open it.
Hmm, I'm so happy.Yes, I went to the Nether.I went to

6182
04:17:13,590 --> 04:17:13,600

 

6183
04:17:13,600 --> 04:17:20,510

Mikuria.It's

6184
04:17:20,510 --> 04:17:20,520

 

6185
04:17:20,520 --> 04:17:29,630

not that bad.Wait a minute.I'll

6186
04:17:29,630 --> 04:17:29,640

 

6187
04:17:29,640 --> 04:17:34,349

think about how to draw it.I'll

6188
04:17:34,349 --> 04:17:34,359
think about how to draw it.I'll
 

6189
04:17:34,359 --> 04:17:40,590
think about how to draw it.I'll
copy

6190
04:17:40,590 --> 04:17:40,600
copy
 

6191
04:17:40,600 --> 04:17:47,429
copy
and paste it properly.Don't do that.Live, live,

6194
04:17:49,520 --> 04:17:57,830

and return Daya's equipment.  I

6195
04:17:57,830 --> 04:18:03,269
and return Daya's equipment.  I
 

6196
04:18:03,269 --> 04:18:03,279

 

6197
04:18:03,279 --> 04:18:08,510

thought they were going to raise a flag,

6198
04:18:08,510 --> 04:18:08,520

 

6199
04:18:08,520 --> 04:18:22,830

6208
04:18:46,630 --> 04:18:46,640
okay. 5  I
 

6209
04:18:46,640 --> 04:18:53,750
okay. 5  I
built a house on January 16th, and I'm glad it hasn't opened. I was

6214
04:19:01,359 --> 04:19:05,189

thought it would really raise a flag,

thought it would really raise a flag,
 

6216
04:19:05,199 --> 04:19:09,229
thought it would really raise a flag,
but I guess it's okay if I go home alive. I'm going to do a lot of

6217
04:19:09,229 --> 04:19:09,239
but I guess it's okay if I go home alive. I'm going to do a lot of
