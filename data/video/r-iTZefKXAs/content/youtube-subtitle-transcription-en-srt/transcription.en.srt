anything even if you showed it and let's

anything even if you showed it and let's
 

8239
03:40:53,279 --> 03:40:55,729
anything even if you showed it and let's
say it's exactly the same shape and

8240
03:40:55,729 --> 03:40:55,739
say it's exactly the same shape and
 

8241

you don't use them for a while and then
you do Nostalgia effect is even higher

13896

have microphones in the studio but they

13990
06:21:40,628 --> 06:21:40,638
have microphones in the studio but they
 

13991
06:21:40,638 --> 06:21:43,970
have microphones in the studio but they
just I guess don't lend them don't

13992
06:21:43,970 --> 06:21:43,980
just I guess don't lend them don't
 

13993
06:21:43,980 --> 06:21:50,390

13995
06:21:50,400 --> 06:21:52,490

and back then I didn't even know that

13996
06:21:52,490 --> 06:21:52,500
and back then I didn't even know that
 

13997
06:21:52,500 --> 06:21:53,628

what if I would go back in time with all

14002
06:21:59,510 --> 06:21:59,520
what if I would go back in time with all
 

14003
06:21:59,520 --> 06:22:01,310
what if I would go back in time with all
that knowledge then that could have been

14004
06:22:01,310 --> 06:22:01,320
that knowledge then that could have been
 

14005
06:22:01,320 --> 06:22:03,650
that knowledge then that could have been
an option

14006
06:22:03,650 --> 06:22:03,660
an option
 

14007
06:22:03,660 --> 06:22:07,430
an option
um and I guess

14008
06:22:07,430 --> 06:22:07,440

if I went back with the knowledge that

14012
06:22:10,970 --> 06:22:10,980
if I went back with the knowledge that
 

14013
06:22:10,980 --> 06:22:13,128
if I went back with the knowledge that
the microphone wouldn't be good then I

14014
06:22:13,128 --> 06:22:13,138
the microphone wouldn't be good then I
 

14015
06:22:13,138 --> 06:22:19,070
the microphone wouldn't be good then I
could maybe borrow money to buy a proper
