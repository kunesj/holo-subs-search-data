and it takes a while uh until it can be
 

1670

and it takes a while uh until it can be
streamed the 3D live and I I asked and

too can you guys sent me the motion

1677
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:25,160
too can you guys sent me the motion
 

1678
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:28,870
too can you guys sent me the motion
capture data perhaps so that I can use

1679
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:28,880
capture data perhaps so that I can use
 

1680
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,549
capture data perhaps so that I can use
it for the music

1681
00:45:31,549 --> 00:45:31,559
it for the music
 

1682
00:45:31,559 --> 00:45:33,150

1683
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:33,160

1684
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:36,510

because yeah I could recorded at home

1685
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:36,520
because yeah I could recorded at home
 

1686
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,910
because yeah I could recorded at home
but if I just get their motion capture

1687
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:38,920
but if I just get their motion capture
 

1688
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,870
but if I just get their motion capture
data then it will be higher

1689
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:40,880
data then it will be higher
 

1690
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,190
data then it will be higher
quality and I might be

1691
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:44,200
quality and I might be
 

1692
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,710
quality and I might be
using backup dancers this time I might

1693
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:47,720
using backup dancers this time I might
 

1694
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:51,190
using backup dancers this time I might
be hiring some backup dancers so that is

1695
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:51,200
be hiring some backup dancers so that is
 

1696
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,710
be hiring some backup dancers so that is
certainly something that is very

1697
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:53,720
certainly something that is very
 

1698
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:56,349
certainly something that is very
difficult to do on my own with my own

1699
00:45:56,349 --> 00:45:56,359
difficult to do on my own with my own

me oh I wonder what she's saying but
 

1706
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:07,710
me oh I wonder what she's saying but
yeah so there is not a certain yes yet

1707
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:07,720
yeah so there is not a certain yes yet
 

1708
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:10,870
yeah so there is not a certain yes yet
but um I was told that yeah could be

1709
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:10,880
but um I was told that yeah could be
 

1710
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,109
but um I was told that yeah could be
possible I will go double check but it

1711
00:46:14,109 --> 00:46:14,119
possible I will go double check but it
 

1712
00:46:14,119 --> 00:46:16,430
possible I will go double check but it
could be very very possible and that

1713
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:16,440
could be very very possible and that
 

1714
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,630
could be very very possible and that
would be really convenient

1715
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:19,640
would be really convenient
 

1716
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:23,510
would be really convenient
so basically like we record the live and

1717
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:23,520
so basically like we record the live and
 

1718
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,430
so basically like we record the live and
then there's like maybe like a free week

1719
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:27,440
then there's like maybe like a free week
 

1720
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,829
then there's like maybe like a free week
uh buffer where it has to be edited

1721
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:30,839
uh buffer where it has to be edited
 

1722
00:46:30,839 --> 00:46:34,950
uh buffer where it has to be edited
anyway and three weeks should be enough

1723
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:34,960
anyway and three weeks should be enough
 

1724
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,870
anyway and three weeks should be enough
especially when like we prepare like

1725
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:37,880
especially when like we prepare like
 

1726
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,549
especially when like we prepare like
backgrounds and all of that beforehand

1727
00:46:39,549 --> 00:46:39,559
backgrounds and all of that beforehand
 

1728
00:46:39,559 --> 00:46:42,270
backgrounds and all of that beforehand
for the music video to like insert the

1729

for the music video to like insert the
 

1730
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,309
for the music video to like insert the
motion capture data into the music video

1731
00:46:44,309 --> 00:46:44,319
motion capture data into the music video
 

1732
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:46,470
motion capture data into the music video
and like finish it up in that time

1733
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:46,480
and like finish it up in that time
 

1734
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:50,309
and like finish it up in that time
honestly that should work so that would

1735
00:46:50,309 --> 00:46:50,319
honestly that should work so that would
 

1736
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:52,549
honestly that should work so that would
be really cool if that works out I'm

1737
00:46:52,549 --> 00:46:52,559
be really cool if that works out I'm
 

1738
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:55,549
be really cool if that works out I'm
kind of counting on that

1739
00:46:55,549 --> 00:46:55,559
kind of counting on that
 

1740
00:46:55,559 --> 00:46:59,510
kind of counting on that
now I hope I hope we can do that then I

1741
00:46:59,510 --> 00:46:59,520
now I hope I hope we can do that then I
 

1742
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,430
now I hope I hope we can do that then I
can have high quality motion capture

1743
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:02,440
can have high quality motion capture
 

1744
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:05,510

videos you can just like take the good
 

1748
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,750
videos you can just like take the good
parts from the motion capture anyway so

1749
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:10,760
parts from the motion capture anyway so
 

1750
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:14,870
parts from the motion capture anyway so
even if I do it with like my little bit

1751
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:14,880
even if I do it with like my little bit
 

1752
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,990
even if I do it with like my little bit

premium economy this one was pretty BL
 

4100
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:38,629
premium economy this one was pretty BL
so I really was so uncomfortable my body

4101
01:43:38,629 --> 01:43:38,639
so I really was so uncomfortable my body
 

4102
01:43:38,639 --> 01:43:43,950
so I really was so uncomfortable my body
was in pain and the it just felt so long

4103
01:43:43,950 --> 01:43:43,960
was in pain and the it just felt so long
 

4104
01:43:43,960 --> 01:43:46,589
was in pain and the it just felt so long
but I thought like now my body condition

4105
01:43:46,589 --> 01:43:46,599
but I thought like now my body condition
 

4106
01:43:46,599 --> 01:43:48,870
but I thought like now my body condition
is even worse than when I came

4107
01:43:48,870 --> 01:43:48,880
is even worse than when I came
 

4108
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:51,229
is even worse than when I came
here and I'm not paying for this flight

4109
01:43:51,229 --> 01:43:51,239
here and I'm not paying for this flight
 

4110
01:43:51,239 --> 01:43:54,229
here and I'm not paying for this flight
so I was wondering maybe

4111
01:43:54,229 --> 01:43:54,239
so I was wondering maybe
 

4112
01:43:54,239 --> 01:43:57,030
so I was wondering maybe
maybe this time I could consider putting

4113
01:43:57,030 --> 01:43:57,040
maybe this time I could consider putting
 

4114
01:43:57,040 --> 01:43:58,910
maybe this time I could consider putting
an upgrade bet

4115
01:43:58,910 --> 01:43:58,920
an upgrade bet
 

4116
01:43:58,920 --> 01:44:01,990
an upgrade bet
again cuz I don't want to like if I at

4117
01:44:01,990 --> 01:44:02,000
again cuz I don't want to like if I at
 

4118
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:05,990
again cuz I don't want to like if I at
least had a window seat man but yeah so

4119
01:44:05,990 --> 01:44:06,000
least had a window seat man but yeah so
 

4120
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,229
least had a window seat man but yeah so
I I checked out if it was possible

4121
01:44:08,229 --> 01:44:08,239
I I checked out if it was possible
 

4122
01:44:08,239 --> 01:44:11,310
I I checked out if it was possible
because if I put an upgrade B bet bid

4123
01:44:11,310 --> 01:44:11,320
because if I put an upgrade B bet bid
 

4124
01:44:11,320 --> 01:44:13,310
because if I put an upgrade B bet bid
that's all I'll be paying for so then I

4125
01:44:13,310 --> 01:44:13,320
that's all I'll be paying for so then I
 

4126
01:44:13,320 --> 01:44:15,390
that's all I'll be paying for so then I
think it's relatively

4127
01:44:15,390 --> 01:44:15,400
think it's relatively
 

4128
01:44:15,400 --> 01:44:17,870
think it's relatively
reasonable cuz previously if I have to

4129
01:44:17,870 --> 01:44:17,880
reasonable cuz previously if I have to
 

4130
01:44:17,880 --> 01:44:20,350
reasonable cuz previously if I have to
pay for the whole flight and the upgrade

4131
01:44:20,350 --> 01:44:20,360
pay for the whole flight and the upgrade
 

4132
01:44:20,360 --> 01:44:22,669
pay for the whole flight and the upgrade
then no then I don't think it's worth it

4133
01:44:22,669 --> 01:44:22,679
then no then I don't think it's worth it
 

4134
01:44:22,679 --> 01:44:23,830
then no then I don't think it's worth it
but in this this case I thought it might

4135
01:44:23,830 --> 01:44:23,840
but in this this case I thought it might
 

4136
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:26,149
but in this this case I thought it might
be worth it so I put in a bet and it

4137
01:44:26,149 --> 01:44:26,159
be worth it so I put in a bet and it
 

4138
01:44:26,159 --> 01:44:28,350
be worth it so I put in a bet and it
already got

4139
01:44:28,350 --> 01:44:28,360
already got
 

4140
01:44:28,360 --> 01:44:31,669
already got
accepted so I think it's fine I put the

4141
01:44:31,669 --> 01:44:31,679
accepted so I think it's fine I put the
 

4142
01:44:31,679 --> 01:44:37,310
accepted so I think it's fine I put the
minimum bet bid bid in uh which like

4143
01:44:37,310 --> 01:44:37,320
minimum bet bid bid in uh which like
 

4144
01:44:37,320 --> 01:44:39,510
minimum bet bid bid in uh which like
€700 but that's all I'm paying for

4145
01:44:39,510 --> 01:44:39,520
€700 but that's all I'm paying for
 

4146
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:42,109
€700 but that's all I'm paying for
that's less than the trip to Japan would

4147
01:44:42,109 --> 01:44:42,119
that's less than the trip to Japan would
 

4148
01:44:42,119 --> 01:44:44,550
that's less than the trip to Japan would
be even an economy class if I paid the

4149
01:44:44,550 --> 01:44:44,560
be even an economy class if I paid the
 

4150
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:47,270
be even an economy class if I paid the
trip myself

4151
01:44:47,270 --> 01:44:47,280
trip myself
 

4152
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:50,270
trip myself
so yeah I think it's fine if I think

4153
01:44:50,270 --> 01:44:50,280
so yeah I think it's fine if I think
 

4154
01:44:50,280 --> 01:44:52,669
so yeah I think it's fine if I think
it's fine yeah for business class then

4155
01:44:52,669 --> 01:44:52,679
it's fine yeah for business class then
 

4156
01:44:52,679 --> 01:44:54,109
it's fine yeah for business class then
they don't even have first class so it's

4157
01:44:54,109 --> 01:44:54,119
they don't even have first class so it's
 

4158
01:44:54,119 --> 01:44:56,550
they don't even have first class so it's
just you know business class I think

4159
01:44:56,550 --> 01:44:56,560
just you know business class I think
 

4160
01:44:56,560 --> 01:44:58,910
just you know business class I think
it's fine because the the back flight is

4161
01:44:58,910 --> 01:44:58,920
it's fine because the the back flight is
 

4162
01:44:58,920 --> 01:45:01,350
it's fine because the the back flight is
even longer than the flight to Japan and

4163
01:45:01,350 --> 01:45:01,360
even longer than the flight to Japan and
 

4164
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:05,510
even longer than the flight to Japan and

that
 

5182
02:09:29,559 --> 02:09:33,189
that
to that the en members or so that live

to that the en members or so that live
 

5184
02:09:33,199 --> 02:09:37,830
to that the en members or so that live
in Japan uh don't necessarily like meet

5185
02:09:37,830 --> 02:09:37,840
in Japan uh don't necessarily like meet
 

5186
02:09:37,840 --> 02:09:44,510
in Japan uh don't necessarily like meet
up a lot with Japanese members either

5187
02:09:44,510 --> 02:09:44,520

 

5188
02:09:44,520 --> 02:09:47,189

so doesn't equal like living in Japan

5189
02:09:47,189 --> 02:09:47,199
so doesn't equal like living in Japan
 

5190
02:09:47,199 --> 02:09:50,030
so doesn't equal like living in Japan
doesn't equal meeting everyone every day

doesn't equal meeting everyone every day
 

5192
02:09:50,040 --> 02:09:52,030
doesn't equal meeting everyone every day
so
