409
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:10,070

Well, on the day of the event, we'll open a gate here. We'll

410
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:10,080

 

411
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:15,630

start from here.

412
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:15,640
start from here.
 

413
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,870
start from here.
Well, it's not one lap per person, it's

414
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:18,880
Well, it's not one lap per person, it's
 

415
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:27,310
Well, it's not one lap per person, it's
half a lap per person.

416
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:27,320

 

417
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,830

One person

418
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:28,840
One person
 

419
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,909
One person
runs from here and goes to the other side.

420
00:18:32,909 --> 00:18:32,919
runs from here and goes to the other side.
 

421
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:35,190
runs from here and goes to the other side.
There's also a line over here, but it

422
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:35,200
There's also a line over here, but it
 

423
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,909
There's also a line over here, but it
seems like you'll be separated from the people who run this far.  So,

424
00:18:40,909 --> 00:18:40,919
seems like you'll be separated from the people who run this far.  So,
 

425
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:44,149
seems like you'll be separated from the people who run this far.  So,
from here on out, we'll run half a mile and then come back to the other line.We'll

426
00:18:44,149 --> 00:18:44,159
from here on out, we'll run half a mile and then come back to the other line.We'll
 

427
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:47,789
from here on out, we'll run half a mile and then come back to the other line.We'll
have two teams, or rather, we'll have them split into two.How

428
00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:47,799
have two teams, or rather, we'll have them split into two.How
 

429
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:51,710
have two teams, or rather, we'll have them split into two.How
many laps will it be?

430
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:51,720
many laps will it be?
 

431
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:57,149
many laps will it be?
2Well, that's eight people running.  I wonder if I'll do 4 laps.

432
00:18:57,149 --> 00:19:10,270
2Well, that's eight people running.  I wonder if I'll do 4 laps.
 

433
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:10,280

 

434
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,830


435
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:11,840

 

436
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,590

Well, for now, let's run

437
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:15,600
Well, for now, let's run
 

438
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,909
Well, for now, let's run
through all of them. Let's all

439
00:19:17,909 --> 00:19:17,919
through all of them. Let's all
 

440
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,350
through all of them. Let's all
look for our strengths and weaknesses, and then we can

441
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:21,360
look for our strengths and weaknesses, and then we can
 

442
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,510
look for our strengths and weaknesses, and then we can
discuss which one is better. If you

443
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:25,520
discuss which one is better. If you
 

444
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,149
discuss which one is better. If you
touch it, you'll get a buff.

445
00:19:30,149 --> 00:19:30,159
touch it, you'll get a buff.
 

446
00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:34,070
touch it, you'll get a buff.
Even this hurdle seems to be a big deal. If you touch it, you'll get

447
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:34,080
Even this hurdle seems to be a big deal. If you touch it, you'll get
 

448
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,310
Even this hurdle seems to be a big deal. If you touch it, you'll get
a buff.  Oh, it's true, I guess it's

449
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:38,320
a buff.  Oh, it's true, I guess it's
 

450
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,430
a buff.  Oh, it's true, I guess it's
slow. Well then, let's run a little.

451
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:40,440
slow. Well then, let's run a little.
 

452
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,350

eat. It feels like I'm eating while running. I wonder

601
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:42,240
eat. It feels like I'm eating while running. I wonder
 

602
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,070
eat. It feels like I'm eating while running. I wonder
if I should eat. If I

if I should eat. If I
 

604
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,549
if I should eat. If I

606
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:52,070
don't eat, the next stage is going to be tough.
Here, too, I'm

00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:52,080
Here, too, I'm
 

608
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,669
Here, too, I'm
going to eat while I'm eating.I can

609
00:25:56,669 --> 00:25:56,679
going to eat while I'm eating.I can
 

610
00:25:56,679 --> 00:26:01,110
going to eat while I'm eating.I can
run fast in places where it's not deep.I can

611
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:01,120
run fast in places where it's not deep.I can
 

612
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,909
run fast in places where it's not deep.I can
run.I can run.It's a concave place.It's so concave that it

613
00:26:03,909 --> 00:26:03,919
run.I can run.It's a concave place.It's so concave that it
 

614
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,510
run.I can run.It's a concave place.It's so concave that it
doesn't look like it's powder snow.  I see,

615
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:06,520
doesn't look like it's powder snow.  I see,
 

616
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:10,110
doesn't look like it's powder snow.  I see,
that's why it's powdery snow ahead, so I

617
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:10,120
that's why it's powdery snow ahead, so I
 

618
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:14,230
that's why it's powdery snow ahead, so I
run as fast as I can and jump.If I

619
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:14,240
run as fast as I can and jump.If I
 

620
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,909
run as fast as I can and jump.If I
keep doing jumps, I can

621
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:16,919
keep doing jumps, I can
 

622
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:20,029
keep doing jumps, I can
run faster.That's right, here on the ice, I keep doing jumps.It's

623
00:26:20,029 --> 00:26:20,039
run faster.That's right, here on the ice, I keep doing jumps.It's
 

624
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:23,110
run faster.That's right, here on the ice, I keep doing jumps.It's
really a jump, so it's the last

625
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:23,120
really a jump, so it's the last
 

626
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,470
really a jump, so it's the last
jump.  Now, if you step in, you'll see, I see, it's like

627
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:29,990
jump.  Now, if you step in, you'll see, I see, it's like
 

628
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:30,000

 

629
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,870

this,

630
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:33,880

 

631
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37,430

and somehow the

632
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:37,440

 

633
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,310

timing is perfect. Oh

634
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:41,320
timing is perfect. Oh
 

635
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:46,190
timing is perfect. Oh
yeah, yeah, yeah, if you prepare like this, you'll probably be able to

636
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:46,200
yeah, yeah, yeah, if you prepare like this, you'll probably be able to
 

637
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:56,590
yeah, yeah, yeah, if you prepare like this, you'll probably be able to
get there without stepping on the snow. That's right,

638
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:56,600

 

639
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,190
