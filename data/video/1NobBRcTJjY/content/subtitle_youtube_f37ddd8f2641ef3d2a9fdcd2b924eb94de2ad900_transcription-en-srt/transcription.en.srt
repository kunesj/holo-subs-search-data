how badly and I thought oh that's fine
 

1641
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,109
how badly and I thought oh that's fine
because I didn't know yet at that point

1642
00:53:52,109 --> 00:53:52,119
because I didn't know yet at that point
 

1643
00:53:52,119 --> 00:53:54,109
because I didn't know yet at that point
that it's per hour also I just thought

1644
00:53:54,109 --> 00:53:54,119
that it's per hour also I just thought
 

1645
00:53:54,119 --> 00:53:55,910
that it's per hour also I just thought
it was per person and then we can be

1646
00:53:55,910 --> 00:53:55,920
it was per person and then we can be
 

1647
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,069
it was per person and then we can be
like for 2 hours or so but because the

1648
00:53:58,069 --> 00:53:58,079
like for 2 hours or so but because the
 

1649
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:01,589
like for 2 hours or so but because the
food look uh still pretty cheap the food

1650

whatever I really want to eat this stuff
that they have on the menu it caught my

1656
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:08,880
that they have on the menu it caught my
 

1657
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,109
that they have on the menu it caught my
ey so

1658
00:54:10,109 --> 00:54:10,119
ey so
 

1659
00:54:10,119 --> 00:54:12,670
ey so
whatever um but like when I arrived they

1660
00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:12,680
whatever um but like when I arrived they
 

1661
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:16,030
whatever um but like when I arrived they
told us it's per hour per person so we

1662
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:16,040
told us it's per hour per person so we
 

1663
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:18,309
told us it's per hour per person so we
have to pay 80 bucks for the first hour

1664
00:54:18,309 --> 00:54:18,319
have to pay 80 bucks for the first hour
 

1665
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:21,349
have to pay 80 bucks for the first hour
together and then if we stayed another

1666
00:54:21,349 --> 00:54:21,359
together and then if we stayed another
 

1667
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:23,270
together and then if we stayed another
then it's

1668
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:23,280
then it's
 

1669
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:28,069
then it's
uh do you do the math 100 60 bucks I

1670
00:54:28,069 --> 00:54:28,079
uh do you do the math 100 60 bucks I
 

1671
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:32,549
uh do you do the math 100 60 bucks I
guess roughly okay uh plus the food and

1672
00:54:32,549 --> 00:54:32,559
guess roughly okay uh plus the food and
 

1673
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:35,190
guess roughly okay uh plus the food and
drinks but I didn't think it was

1674
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:35,200
drinks but I didn't think it was
 

1675
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,990
drinks but I didn't think it was
necessary to stay longer anyway because

1676
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:37,000
necessary to stay longer anyway because
 

1677
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,589
necessary to stay longer anyway because
when we arrived and we were led to the

wants to do it but then she doesn't she

10594
06:03:30,788 --> 06:03:30,798
wants to do it but then she doesn't she
 

10595
06:03:30,798 --> 06:03:34,030
wants to do it but then she doesn't she
doesn't like like like push me to do it

10596
06:03:34,030 --> 06:03:34,040
