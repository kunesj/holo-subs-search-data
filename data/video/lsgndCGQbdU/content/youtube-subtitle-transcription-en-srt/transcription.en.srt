1384
00:41:22,349 --> 00:41:22,359
and
 

1385
00:41:22,359 --> 00:41:25,390
and
okay I'm not a dance teacher so probably

1386
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:25,400
okay I'm not a dance teacher so probably
 

1387
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,069
okay I'm not a dance teacher so probably
that wasn't the right order to do it but

1388
00:41:27,069 --> 00:41:27,079
that wasn't the right order to do it but
 

1389
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:28,790
that wasn't the right order to do it but
okay I'll I'll explain it step by step

1390
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:28,800
okay I'll I'll explain it step by step
 

1391
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,750
okay I'll I'll explain it step by step
now you have a little bit of an example

1392
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:30,760
now you have a little bit of an example
 

1393
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:33,470
now you have a little bit of an example
that you can go back to but step by step

1394
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:33,480
that you can go back to but step by step
 

1395
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:37,950
that you can go back to but step by step
it's like this you um left leg uh you if

1396
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:37,960
it's like this you um left leg uh you if
 

1397
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,150
it's like this you um left leg uh you if
you want to learn this you probably have

1398
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:39,160
you want to learn this you probably have
 

1399
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:42,349
you want to learn this you probably have
to like horizontally flip the screen but

1400
00:41:42,349 --> 00:41:42,359
to like horizontally flip the screen but
 

1401
00:41:42,359 --> 00:41:43,910
to like horizontally flip the screen but
actually I can do that for

1402
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:43,920
actually I can do that for
 

1403
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,470
actually I can do that for
you I

1404
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:46,480
you I
 

1405
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:52,430
you I
shall I know I can flip the the

1406
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:52,440

 

1407
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,550

1409
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,150

uh um I'm probably have

1410
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:58,160
uh um I'm probably have
 

1411
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,950
uh um I'm probably have
to

1412
00:41:59,950 --> 00:41:59,960
to
 

1413
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,950
to
wait ignore that I I'm going to reset it

1414
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:02,960
wait ignore that I I'm going to reset it
 

1415
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:09,990
wait ignore that I I'm going to reset it
so I can flip the motion for

1416
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:10,000

 

1417
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,990

mirror so even though I'm doing it on my

1430
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:30,160
mirror so even though I'm doing it on my
 

1431
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,309
mirror so even though I'm doing it on my
right hip it looks like I'm doing

1432
00:42:33,309 --> 00:42:33,319
right hip it looks like I'm doing
 

1433
00:42:33,319 --> 00:42:36,309
right hip it looks like I'm doing
it well on the left but of course so

1434
00:42:36,309 --> 00:42:36,319
it well on the left but of course so
 

1435
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:38,470
it well on the left but of course so
it's mirror so you can look at

1436
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:38,480
it's mirror so you can look at
 

1437
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,670
it's mirror so you can look at
this right wait does that make sense or

1438
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:41,680
this right wait does that make sense or
 

1439
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,829
this right wait does that make sense or
is it should I no wait should it be the

1440
00:42:44,829 --> 00:42:44,839
is it should I no wait should it be the
 

1441
00:42:44,839 --> 00:42:46,750
is it should I no wait should it be the
other way

1442
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:46,760
other way
 

1443
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:49,430
