maybe trying like OBS ninja it's another
 

8083
03:58:54,880 --> 03:58:57,429
maybe trying like OBS ninja it's another
tool that we used sometimes before but

8084
03:58:57,429 --> 03:58:57,439
tool that we used sometimes before but
 

8085
03:58:57,439 --> 03:59:04,110
tool that we used sometimes before but
not really so familiar with it um but H

8086

not really so familiar with it um but H
then she had the idea of like instead of

8088
03:59:07,870 --> 03:59:07,880
then she had the idea of like instead of
 

8089
03:59:07,880 --> 03:59:09,110
then she had the idea of like instead of
capturing

8090
03:59:09,110 --> 03:59:09,120
capturing
 

8091
03:59:09,120 --> 03:59:13,750
capturing
either OBS or the game capture

8092
03:59:13,750 --> 03:59:13,760
either OBS or the game capture
 

8093
03:59:13,760 --> 03:59:17,070
either OBS or the game capture
directly uh instead of that turning on

8094
03:59:17,070 --> 03:59:17,080
directly uh instead of that turning on
 

8095
03:59:17,080 --> 03:59:19,550
directly uh instead of that turning on
the virtual camera in

8096
03:59:19,550 --> 03:59:19,560
the virtual camera in
 

8097
03:59:19,560 --> 03:59:23,189
the virtual camera in
OBS and then in Discord instead of

8098
03:59:23,189 --> 03:59:23,199
OBS and then in Discord instead of
 

8099
03:59:23,199 --> 03:59:25,790
OBS and then in Discord instead of
screen share it would be like turning on

8100
03:59:25,790 --> 03:59:25,800
screen share it would be like turning on
 

8101
03:59:25,800 --> 03:59:28,870
screen share it would be like turning on
a webcam because OBS turns into a webcam

8102
03:59:28,870 --> 03:59:28,880
a webcam because OBS turns into a webcam
 

8103
03:59:28,880 --> 03:59:30,830
a webcam because OBS turns into a webcam
when you turn on the virtual

8104
03:59:30,830 --> 03:59:30,840
when you turn on the virtual
 

8105
03:59:30,840 --> 03:59:33,710
when you turn on the virtual
camera and that actually

8106
03:59:33,710 --> 03:59:33,720
camera and that actually
 

8107
03:59:33,720 --> 03:59:36,710
camera and that actually
worked the problem was only that through

8108
03:59:36,710 --> 03:59:36,720
worked the problem was only that through
 

8109
03:59:36,720 --> 03:59:40,590
worked the problem was only that through
this uh I couldn't quickly easily maybe

8110
03:59:40,590 --> 03:59:40,600
this uh I couldn't quickly easily maybe
 

8111
03:59:40,600 --> 03:59:42,429
this uh I couldn't quickly easily maybe
there was a way to do it but in this

8112
03:59:42,429 --> 03:59:42,439
there was a way to do it but in this
 

8113
03:59:42,439 --> 03:59:44,790
there was a way to do it but in this
situation I couldn't uh share the sound

8114
03:59:44,790 --> 03:59:44,800
situation I couldn't uh share the sound
 

8115
03:59:44,800 --> 03:59:46,710
situation I couldn't uh share the sound
with them but the sound wasn't so

8116
03:59:46,710 --> 03:59:46,720
with them but the sound wasn't so
 

8117
03:59:46,720 --> 03:59:48,750
with them but the sound wasn't so
important for the game I would say at

8118
03:59:48,750 --> 03:59:48,760
important for the game I would say at
 

8119
03:59:48,760 --> 03:59:53,309
important for the game I would say at
all

8120

it really but they were able to read

8128
04:00:03,630 --> 04:00:03,640
it really but they were able to read
 

8129
04:00:03,640 --> 04:00:05,269
it really but they were able to read
things though if it was mirrored I don't

8130
04:00:05,269 --> 04:00:05,279
things though if it was mirrored I don't
 

8131
04:00:05,279 --> 04:00:07,349
things though if it was mirrored I don't
think they would have been able to read

8132
04:00:07,349 --> 04:00:07,359
think they would have been able to read
 

8133
04:00:07,359 --> 04:00:11,830
think they would have been able to read
it

8134
04:00:11,830 --> 04:00:11,840

 

8135
04:00:11,840 --> 04:00:14,710

H seemed fine they didn't say anything

8136

H seemed fine they didn't say anything
 

8137
04:00:14,720 --> 04:00:16,429
H seemed fine they didn't say anything
about it being mirrored so I think it

8138
04:00:16,429 --> 04:00:16,439
about it being mirrored so I think it
 

8139
04:00:16,439 --> 04:00:21,870
about it being mirrored so I think it
was

8140
04:00:21,870 --> 04:00:21,880

 

8141
04:00:21,880 --> 04:00:23,550

did all the characters I did them
 

8155
04:00:43,560 --> 04:00:47,149
did all the characters I did them
beforehand off stream um I played one

8156
04:00:47,149 --> 04:00:47,159
beforehand off stream um I played one
 

8157
04:00:47,159 --> 04:00:49,630
beforehand off stream um I played one
round uh to get some points for items

8158
04:00:49,630 --> 04:00:49,640
round uh to get some points for items
 

8159
04:00:49,640 --> 04:00:51,710
round uh to get some points for items
too and get an understanding if if I can

8160
04:00:51,710 --> 04:00:51,720
too and get an understanding if if I can
 

8161

type quick enough I wanted to practice

8162
04:00:53,910 --> 04:00:53,920
type quick enough I wanted to practice
 

8163
04:00:53,920 --> 04:00:57,149
type quick enough I wanted to practice
typing so I prepared a little

8164
04:00:57,149 --> 04:00:57,159
typing so I prepared a little
 

8165
04:00:57,159 --> 04:00:59,149
typing so I prepared a little
bit and then I wanted to do the

8166
04:00:59,149 --> 04:00:59,159
bit and then I wanted to do the
 

8167
04:00:59,159 --> 04:01:01,349
bit and then I wanted to do the
characters so uh that we wouldn't have

8168
04:01:01,349 --> 04:01:01,359
characters so uh that we wouldn't have
 

8169
04:01:01,359 --> 04:01:03,389
characters so uh that we wouldn't have
to spend too much time on it on stream

8170
04:01:03,389 --> 04:01:03,399
to spend too much time on it on stream
 

8171
04:01:03,399 --> 04:01:05,950
to spend too much time on it on stream
or like right before the stream it did

8172
04:01:05,950 --> 04:01:05,960
or like right before the stream it did
 

8173
04:01:05,960 --> 04:01:07,830
or like right before the stream it did
take a little while so it was good that

8174
04:01:07,830 --> 04:01:07,840
take a little while so it was good that
 

8175
04:01:07,840 --> 04:01:08,870
take a little while so it was good that
I did

8176
04:01:08,870 --> 04:01:08,880
I did
 

8177
04:01:08,880 --> 04:01:11,710
I did
before and then before the stream I gave

8178
04:01:11,710 --> 04:01:11,720
before and then before the stream I gave
 

8179
04:01:11,720 --> 04:01:13,550
before and then before the stream I gave
them I showed it to them and I gave them

8180
04:01:13,550 --> 04:01:13,560
them I showed it to them and I gave them
 

8181
04:01:13,560 --> 04:01:15,389
them I showed it to them and I gave them
the option to change like small things

8182
04:01:15,389 --> 04:01:15,399
the option to change like small things
 

8183
04:01:15,399 --> 04:01:18,550
the option to change like small things
but they were mostly happy with

8184
04:01:18,550 --> 04:01:18,560
but they were mostly happy with
 

8185
04:01:18,560 --> 04:01:23,349
but they were mostly happy with
it so all prepared quite well I would

8186
04:01:23,349 --> 04:01:23,359
it so all prepared quite well I would
 

8187
04:01:23,359 --> 04:01:24,520
it so all prepared quite well I would
say

8188
04:01:24,520 --> 04:01:24,530

stream H yeah it didn't really crash I

8196
04:01:38,469 --> 04:01:38,479
stream H yeah it didn't really crash I
 

8197
04:01:38,479 --> 04:01:40,110
stream H yeah it didn't really crash I
think that one crash was only because I

8198
04:01:40,110 --> 04:01:40,120
think that one crash was only because I
 

8199
04:01:40,120 --> 04:01:44,229
think that one crash was only because I
had it open like through the night and

8200
04:01:44,229 --> 04:01:44,239
had it open like through the night and
 

8201
04:01:44,239 --> 04:01:46,070
had it open like through the night and
then the switch was like

8202
04:01:46,070 --> 04:01:46,080
then the switch was like
 

8203
04:01:46,080 --> 04:01:49,910
then the switch was like
on it was not like completely off I

8204
04:01:49,910 --> 04:01:49,920
on it was not like completely off I
 

8205
04:01:49,920 --> 04:01:51,349
on it was not like completely off I
guess it was just like standby or

8206
04:01:51,349 --> 04:01:51,359
guess it was just like standby or
 

8207
04:01:51,359 --> 04:01:52,830
guess it was just like standby or
whatever I don't

8208
04:01:52,830 --> 04:01:52,840
whatever I don't
 

8209
04:01:52,840 --> 04:01:55,710
whatever I don't
know so it was just open for too long

8210
04:01:55,710 --> 04:01:55,720
know so it was just open for too long
 

8211
04:01:55,720 --> 04:01:57,030
