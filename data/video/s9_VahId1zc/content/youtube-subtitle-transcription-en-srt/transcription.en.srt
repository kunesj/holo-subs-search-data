wish we would have not taking it that
 

983
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,430
wish we would have not taking it that
easy but if they had everything under

00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:20,440
easy but if they had everything under
 

985
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,750
easy but if they had everything under
more control then this would that we

986
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:23,760
more control then this would that we
 

987
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,269
more control then this would that we
could would have been fine but they

988
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:25,279
could would have been fine but they
 

989
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,029
could would have been fine but they
certainly do not have anything under

1028
00:28:31,789 --> 00:28:31,799
feeling of my memory so we finally find
 

1029
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:34,950
feeling of my memory so we finally find
some stairs that lead up to the security

1030
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:34,960
some stairs that lead up to the security
 

1031
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,669
some stairs that lead up to the security
thingy it's on the floor above but then

1032
00:28:37,669 --> 00:28:37,679
thingy it's on the floor above but then
 

1033
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,789
thingy it's on the floor above but then
there's a lady standing there who's

1034
00:28:39,789 --> 00:28:39,799
there's a lady standing there who's
 

1035
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:42,269
there's a lady standing there who's
saying no no go the other way all the

00:28:42,269 --> 00:28:42,279
saying no no go the other way all the
 

1037
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:44,070
saying no no go the other way all the
way all the way over she's just pointing

1038
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:44,080
way all the way over she's just pointing
 

1039
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,750
way all the way over she's just pointing
somewhere to the other side um because

1040
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:47,760
somewhere to the other side um because
 

1041
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,269
somewhere to the other side um because
those stairs they were like there was a

1042
00:28:50,269 --> 00:28:50,279
those stairs they were like there was a
 

1043
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:53,190
those stairs they were like there was a
tape over them so you couldn't pass

1044
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:53,200
tape over them so you couldn't pass
 

1045
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,269
tape over them so you couldn't pass
somehow they didn't want people to use

1046
00:28:55,269 --> 00:28:55,279
somehow they didn't want people to use
 

1047
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,909
somehow they didn't want people to use
that so we kept on looking for the other

1048
00:28:57,909 --> 00:28:57,919
that so we kept on looking for the other
 

1049
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:58,710
that so we kept on looking for the other
uh

1050
00:28:58,710 --> 00:28:58,720
uh
 

1051
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,310
uh
entrance into that or to at least go to

1052
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:01,320
entrance into that or to at least go to
 

1053
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:05,029
entrance into that or to at least go to
the second floor um and then we finally

1054
00:29:05,029 --> 00:29:05,039
the second floor um and then we finally
 

1055
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,750
the second floor um and then we finally
find it it's like really far away and we

1056
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:07,760
find it it's like really far away and we
 

1057
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,909
find it it's like really far away and we
go up and then we see basically we come

1058
00:29:12,909 --> 00:29:12,919
go up and then we see basically we come
 

1059
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:16,830
go up and then we see basically we come
up from some

1060
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:16,840
up from some
 

1061
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:21,630
up from some
wait we come up from some

1062
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:21,640
wait we come up from some
 

1063
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:26,310
wait we come up from some
escalator and I think you could say

1064
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:26,320
escalator and I think you could say
 

1065
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,029

let's see uh he

1066

let's see uh he
 

1067
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:32,789
let's see uh he
here here

1068
00:29:32,789 --> 00:29:32,799
here here
 

1069
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,070

some
 

1073
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:39,950
some
security gates not many but maybe

1074
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:39,960
security gates not many but maybe
 

1075
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,509
security gates not many but maybe
approximately this many where you go

1076
00:29:42,509 --> 00:29:42,519
approximately this many where you go
 

1077
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:45,389
approximately this many where you go
through by scanning your ticket and then

1078
00:29:45,389 --> 00:29:45,399
through by scanning your ticket and then
 

1079
00:29:45,399 --> 00:29:48,230
through by scanning your ticket and then
you know the the usual like uh you put

1080
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:48,240
you know the the usual like uh you put
 

1081
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,149
you know the the usual like uh you put
your

1082
00:29:49,149 --> 00:29:49,159
your
 

1083
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:51,669
your
bags uh and you go through a human

1084
00:29:51,669 --> 00:29:51,679
bags uh and you go through a human
 

1085
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:55,190
bags uh and you go through a human
scanner and all that so that's

1086
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:55,200
scanner and all that so that's
 

1087
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,950
scanner and all that so that's
there and we didn't even look closely

1088
00:29:58,950 --> 00:29:58,960
there and we didn't even look closely
 

1089
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,549
there and we didn't even look closely
over there because we we were a little

1090
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:00,559
over there because we we were a little
 

1091
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:05,310
over there because we we were a little
bit far from that um but what we saw

1092
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:05,320
bit far from that um but what we saw
 

1093
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:09,190
bit far from that um but what we saw

cut off here so that people could pass
 

1115
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,830
cut off here so that people could pass
through to go somewhere else or to join

through to go somewhere else or to join
 

1117
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,110
through to go somewhere else or to join
the line if they

1118
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:49,120
the line if they
 

1119
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,669
the line if they
are well important enough in terms of

1120
00:30:52,669 --> 00:30:52,679
are well important enough in terms of
 

1121

their boarding
 

1123
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,029
their boarding
times um so we like still kind of

00:30:58,029 --> 00:30:58,039
times um so we like still kind of
 

1125
00:30:58,039 --> 00:31:01,549

clueless to how long this line is um but

1126
00:31:01,549 --> 00:31:01,559
clueless to how long this line is um but
 

1127
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:04,669
clueless to how long this line is um but
we go there we check with him he's like

1128
00:31:04,669 --> 00:31:04,679
we go there we check with him he's like
 

1129
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:07,149
we go there we check with him he's like
he's like pointing to that direction we

1130
00:31:07,149 --> 00:31:07,159
he's like pointing to that direction we
 

1131
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:13,269
he's like pointing to that direction we
go there and then there's another person

1132
00:31:13,269 --> 00:31:13,279
go there and then there's another person
 

1133
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:16,990
go there and then there's another person
here and then we realize okay this is

1134
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:17,000
here and then we realize okay this is
 

1135
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,269
here and then we realize okay this is
not it uh the line then

1136
00:31:22,269 --> 00:31:22,279
not it uh the line then
 

1137
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:25,389
not it uh the line then
goes over

1138
00:31:25,389 --> 00:31:25,399
goes over
 

1139
00:31:25,399 --> 00:31:28,629
goes over
there and then uh

1140
00:31:28,629 --> 00:31:28,639
there and then uh
 

1141
00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:31,780
there and then uh
uh there was I think another

1142
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:31,790
uh there was I think another
 

1143

turn that was I think maybe I don't know

1146
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:36,720
turn that was I think maybe I don't know
 

1147
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,470
turn that was I think maybe I don't know
exactly anymore but there was another

1148
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:38,480
exactly anymore but there was another
 

1149
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,710
exactly anymore but there was another
turn and then there was the doors to

1150
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:42,720
turn and then there was the doors to
 

1151
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,389
turn and then there was the doors to
outside of the

1152
00:31:45,389 --> 00:31:45,399
outside of the
 

1153
00:31:45,399 --> 00:31:47,310
outside of the
airport

1154
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:47,320
airport
 

1155
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,110

so

1156
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:50,120
so
 

1157
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:54,669
so
here people were also standing I think

1158
00:31:54,669 --> 00:31:54,679
here people were also standing I think
 

1159
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:56,389
here people were also standing I think
there was another person maybe standing

1160
00:31:56,389 --> 00:31:56,399

00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:16,160
volunteer and could check if something
 

1463
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,190
volunteer and could check if something
can be done because time was taking and

ingredients are already in when you cook

11550
05:20:20,510 --> 05:20:20,520
ingredients are already in when you cook
 

11551
05:20:20,520 --> 05:20:24,350
