still felt like if I don't add a
 

6172
02:48:54,840 --> 02:48:56,830
still felt like if I don't add a
background it's going to be like it's it

6173

6178
02:49:01,319 --> 02:49:03,469
right and N I should draw a background
like I felt kind of obligated to do

6179
02:49:03,469 --> 02:49:03,479
like I felt kind of obligated to do
 

6180
02:49:03,479 --> 02:49:05,990
like I felt kind of obligated to do
it

6181
02:49:05,990 --> 02:49:06,000
