00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,510
for tomorrow or even for the current day
like in the morning i would check the

884
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:13,520

885
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,190
like in the morning i would check the
weather report for the current day on

886
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:15,200
weather report for the current day on
 

887
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,149
weather report for the current day on
like for example tuesday and it said uh

888
00:22:18,149 --> 00:22:18,159
like for example tuesday and it said uh
 

889
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:19,990
like for example tuesday and it said uh
okay two hours sunshine and then what

890
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:20,000
okay two hours sunshine and then what
 

891
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,470
okay two hours sunshine and then what
happens

892
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:22,480

 

893
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,870

rain rain rain rain and then

894
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:24,880
rain rain rain rain and then
 

895
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,230
rain rain rain rain and then
after the two hours maybe one hour

896
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:26,240
after the two hours maybe one hour
 

897
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,750
after the two hours maybe one hour
sunshine or whatever but like it's so

898
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:27,760
sunshine or whatever but like it's so
 

899
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,990
sunshine or whatever but like it's so
unpredictable it's never accurate here

900
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:30,000
unpredictable it's never accurate here
 

901
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,470
unpredictable it's never accurate here
and i guess it's because monster season

902
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:32,480
and i guess it's because monster season
 

903
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,110
and i guess it's because monster season
so rains are unpredictable happening

904
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:35,120
so rains are unpredictable happening
 

905
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,549
so rains are unpredictable happening
whenever
