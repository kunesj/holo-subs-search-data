2561
01:31:18,159 --> 01:31:21,830
think it's perfect when paired together.  We
played takoyaki with a proper bounce width, and

2568
01:31:30,920 --> 01:31:36,709

think it was last year, maybe last year. It's about time to

2569
01:31:36,709 --> 01:31:36,719
think it was last year, maybe last year. It's about time to
 

2570
01:31:36,719 --> 01:31:39,590
think it was last year, maybe last year. It's about time to
move on.

2571

But it's true that things like this take a long time. There's a lot to

2574
01:31:44,990 --> 01:31:45,000
But it's true that things like this take a long time. There's a lot to
 

2575
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:49,430
But it's true that things like this take a long time. There's a lot to
do,

01:31:49,430 --> 01:31:49,440
do,
 

2577
01:31:49,440 --> 01:32:05,709

There's a reason why I was able to continue being active. I
went through a lot of hardships right after my debut. Maybe

01:51:24,069 --> 01:51:24,079
went through a lot of hardships right after my debut. Maybe
 

3162
01:51:24,079 --> 01:51:29,470
went through a lot of hardships right after my debut. Maybe
it's a crappy, crappy, crappy network.

01:51:29,470 --> 01:51:29,480
it's a crappy, crappy, crappy network.

3166
01:51:34,440 --> 01:51:39,669
Looks like I've been
on a crappy network for about 2 and a half months, so

3167
01:51:39,669 --> 01:51:39,679
on a crappy network for about 2 and a half months, so
 

3168
01:51:39,679 --> 01:51:42,790
on a crappy network for about 2 and a half months, so
wait, that's

3169
01:51:42,790 --> 01:51:42,800
wait, that's
 

3170
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:46,870
wait, that's
a bit long.

3171
01:51:46,870 --> 01:51:50,270

n't seem to do anything interesting while talking while playing the game.But I

01:52:32,109 --> 01:52:32,119
n't seem to do anything interesting while talking while playing the game.But I
 

3186
01:52:32,119 --> 01:52:36,990
n't seem to do anything interesting while talking while playing the game.But I
did improve quickly, and I

3187
01:52:36,990 --> 01:52:37,000
did improve quickly, and I
 

3188
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:41,229
did improve quickly, and I
think I did it

3189
01:52:41,229 --> 01:52:41,239
think I did it
 

3190
01:52:41,239 --> 01:52:44,950
think I did it
because I'm good at speaking.  I'm so happy for my seniors,

3191
01:52:44,950 --> 01:52:44,960
because I'm good at speaking.  I'm so happy for my seniors,
 

3192
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:49,470
because I'm good at speaking.  I'm so happy for my seniors,
so that's why I was able to keep going.

3193
01:52:49,470 --> 01:52:49,480
so that's why I was able to keep going.
 

3194
01:52:49,480 --> 01:52:55,510

lived in a one-room apartment in Japan, which is extremely inaccessible, and
even if I spoke in that loud voice, the person next to me would bang bang bang bang.  It was so bad that I

couldn't stream it right away, so even after I
 

3221
01:54:01,520 --> 01:54:04,310
