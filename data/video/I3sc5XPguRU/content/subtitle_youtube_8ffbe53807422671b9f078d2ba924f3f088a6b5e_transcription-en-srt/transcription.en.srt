reason why i'm asking you guys for help
because

5702
03:08:13,030 --> 03:08:13,040
because
 

5703
03:08:13,040 --> 03:08:16,309
because
i thought maybe some of you um are big

5704
03:08:16,309 --> 03:08:16,319
i thought maybe some of you um are big
 

5705
03:08:16,319 --> 03:08:17,990
i thought maybe some of you um are big
fans of people's empire maybe some of

5706
03:08:17,990 --> 03:08:18,000
fans of people's empire maybe some of
 

5707
03:08:18,000 --> 03:08:19,670
fans of people's empire maybe some of
you know a lot about her

5708
03:08:19,670 --> 03:08:19,680
you know a lot about her
 

5709
03:08:19,680 --> 03:08:21,269
you know a lot about her
and can't help out with these questions

5710
03:08:21,269 --> 03:08:21,279
and can't help out with these questions
 

5711
03:08:21,279 --> 03:08:23,110
and can't help out with these questions
but it ends up

5712
03:08:23,110 --> 03:08:23,120
but it ends up
 

5713
03:08:23,120 --> 03:08:26,150
but it ends up
still most of the questions being very

5714
03:08:26,150 --> 03:08:26,160
still most of the questions being very
 

5715
03:08:26,160 --> 03:08:30,309
still most of the questions being very
um very superficial still you know

5716
03:08:30,309 --> 03:08:30,319
um very superficial still you know
 

5717
03:08:30,319 --> 03:08:32,550
um very superficial still you know
they're good questions interesting

5718
03:08:32,550 --> 03:08:32,560
they're good questions interesting
 

5719
03:08:32,560 --> 03:08:41,750
they're good questions interesting
questions it's very general

5720
03:08:41,750 --> 03:08:41,760

 

5721
03:08:41,760 --> 03:08:45,510

so i'm thinking maybe

5722
03:08:45,510 --> 03:08:45,520

 

5723
03:08:45,520 --> 03:08:48,389

i'm thinking maybe next time when i'm

5724
03:08:48,389 --> 03:08:48,399
i'm thinking maybe next time when i'm
 

5725
03:08:48,399 --> 03:08:55,269
i'm thinking maybe next time when i'm
asking for questions again

5726
03:08:55,269 --> 03:08:55,279

 

5727
03:08:55,279 --> 03:08:58,550

maybe next time i just ask in japanese

5728
03:08:58,550 --> 03:08:58,560
maybe next time i just ask in japanese
 

5729
03:08:58,560 --> 03:09:00,150
maybe next time i just ask in japanese
for questions i asked

5730
03:09:00,150 --> 03:09:00,160
for questions i asked
 

5731
03:09:00,160 --> 03:09:02,790
for questions i asked
because the japanese bros most of them

5732
03:09:02,790 --> 03:09:02,800
because the japanese bros most of them
 

5733
