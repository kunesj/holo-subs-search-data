02:46:25,670 --> 02:46:25,680
and that's probably why
 

6441
02:46:25,680 --> 02:46:27,750

uh

6442
02:46:27,750 --> 02:46:27,760
uh
 

6443
02:46:27,760 --> 02:46:29,830

that's probably how the japanese people

6444
02:46:29,830 --> 02:46:29,840
that's probably how the japanese people
 

6445
02:46:29,840 --> 02:46:31,110
that's probably how the japanese people
