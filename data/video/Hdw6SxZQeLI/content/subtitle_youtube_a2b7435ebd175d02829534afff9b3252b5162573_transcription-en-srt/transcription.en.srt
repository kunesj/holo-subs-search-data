though so with the evidence that we have

3550
01:49:49,109 --> 01:49:49,119
though so with the evidence that we have
 

3551
01:49:49,119 --> 01:49:50,790
though so with the evidence that we have
the only other thing that we could find

3552
01:49:50,790 --> 01:49:50,800
the only other thing that we could find
 

3553
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:53,270
the only other thing that we could find
is ghost orbs or ghost writing

3554
01:49:53,270 --> 01:49:53,280
is ghost orbs or ghost writing
 

3555
