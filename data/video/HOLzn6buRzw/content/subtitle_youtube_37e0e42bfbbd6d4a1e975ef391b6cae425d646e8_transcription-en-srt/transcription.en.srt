00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:14,240
probably if they didn't like being naked
 

1627
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,950
probably if they didn't like being naked
they would become a snail and put a

1628
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:15,960
they would become a snail and put a
 

1629
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:18,549
they would become a snail and put a
house on their body also that would lead

00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:25,160
house on their body so I think they they
 

1637
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,390
house on their body so I think they they

oh my God it was so like traumatizing
but then it became kind of a part of my

4228
01:48:58,629 --> 01:48:58,639
but then it became kind of a part of my
 

4229
01:48:58,639 --> 01:49:01,149
but then it became kind of a part of my
identity while I

4230
01:49:01,149 --> 01:49:01,159
identity while I
 

4231
01:49:01,159 --> 01:49:04,149
identity while I
was and then I was sad when I left that

4232
01:49:04,149 --> 01:49:04,159
was and then I was sad when I left that
 

4233
01:49:04,159 --> 01:49:06,629
was and then I was sad when I left that

01:49:08,470 --> 01:49:08,480
because no there was some weird
 

4237
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:10,750
because no there was some weird
sentimental like connection at the end

4238
01:49:10,750 --> 01:49:10,760
sentimental like connection at the end
 

4239
01:49:10,760 --> 01:49:14,310
sentimental like connection at the end
of all of that with the rats yeah it's

4240
01:49:14,310 --> 01:49:14,320
of all of that with the rats yeah it's
 

4241
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:16,390
of all of that with the rats yeah it's
weird it's a whole

4242
01:49:16,390 --> 01:49:16,400
weird it's a whole
 

4243
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:21,430
weird it's a whole
thing is it ins kind of cute but no not

4244
01:49:21,430 --> 01:49:21,440
thing is it ins kind of cute but no not
 

4245
01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:23,550
thing is it ins kind of cute but no not
I I don't think they're cute or anything

4246
01:49:23,550 --> 01:49:23,560
I I don't think they're cute or anything
 

4247
01:49:23,560 --> 01:49:25,550
I I don't think they're cute or anything
but like first I was really terrified

4248
01:49:25,550 --> 01:49:25,560
but like first I was really terrified
 

4249
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:26,830
but like first I was really terrified
and I wasn't feeling comfortable I

4250
01:49:26,830 --> 01:49:26,840
and I wasn't feeling comfortable I
 

4251
01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:28,830
and I wasn't feeling comfortable I
didn't want to sleep I kept on hearing

4252
01:49:28,830 --> 01:49:28,840
didn't want to sleep I kept on hearing
 

4253
01:49:28,840 --> 01:49:32,629
didn't want to sleep I kept on hearing
the noises the tippy tis and everything

4254
01:49:32,629 --> 01:49:32,639
the noises the tippy tis and everything
 

4255
01:49:32,639 --> 01:49:35,510
the noises the tippy tis and everything
but then basically I think the reason

4256
01:49:35,510 --> 01:49:35,520
but then basically I think the reason
 

4257
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:38,189
but then basically I think the reason
why I became so attached to it it was

4258
01:49:38,189 --> 01:49:38,199
why I became so attached to it it was
 

4259
01:49:38,199 --> 01:49:39,550
why I became so attached to it it was
because at the time it was in the middle

4260
01:49:39,550 --> 01:49:39,560
because at the time it was in the middle
 

4261
01:49:39,560 --> 01:49:43,470
because at the time it was in the middle
of Corona and I was just kind of like in

4262
01:49:43,470 --> 01:49:43,480
of Corona and I was just kind of like in
 

4263
01:49:43,480 --> 01:49:45,790
of Corona and I was just kind of like in
a bad mental state I was just kind of

4264
01:49:45,790 --> 01:49:45,800
a bad mental state I was just kind of
 

4265
01:49:45,800 --> 01:49:48,870
a bad mental state I was just kind of
sad and alone and isolated and all that

4266
01:49:48,870 --> 01:49:48,880
sad and alone and isolated and all that
 

4267
01:49:48,880 --> 01:49:51,629
sad and alone and isolated and all that
and then um it came to the point where I

4268
01:49:51,629 --> 01:49:51,639
and then um it came to the point where I
 

4269
01:49:51,639 --> 01:49:53,709
and then um it came to the point where I
had to leave Austria

4270
01:49:53,709 --> 01:49:53,719

place I don't understand because it was

6350
02:43:27,550 --> 02:43:27,560
place I don't understand because it was
 

6351
02:43:27,560 --> 02:43:29,630
place I don't understand because it was
so difficult with this one it was so

6352
02:43:29,630 --> 02:43:29,640
so difficult with this one it was so
 

6353
02:43:29,640 --> 02:43:32,389
so difficult with this one it was so
difficult and then I'm left-handed so

6354
02:43:32,389 --> 02:43:32,399
difficult and then I'm left-handed so
 

6355
02:43:32,399 --> 02:43:33,910
difficult and then I'm left-handed so
first of all I have to get into awkward

6361
02:43:40,840 --> 02:43:43,150

that the fact that it's a right-handed

6362
02:43:43,150 --> 02:43:43,160
that the fact that it's a right-handed
 

6363
02:43:43,160 --> 02:43:45,990
that the fact that it's a right-handed
scissor makes it even more difficult so

6364
02:43:45,990 --> 02:43:46,000
scissor makes it even more difficult so

they're like uh basically putting the
 

7191
03:04:22,439 --> 03:04:24,349
they're like uh basically putting the
words into his mouth like for money and

7192
03:04:24,349 --> 03:04:24,359
words into his mouth like for money and
 

7193

implication and he's like yeah yeah but
I don't even think that's what his fault

7202
03:04:39,750 --> 03:04:39,760
I don't even think that's what his fault
 

7203
03:04:39,760 --> 03:04:41,190
I don't even think that's what his fault
was when he started doing that he just

7204
03:04:41,190 --> 03:04:41,200
was when he started doing that he just
 

7205
03:04:41,200 --> 03:04:43,710
was when he started doing that he just
wanted to do like he felt like really

7206
03:04:43,710 --> 03:04:43,720
wanted to do like he felt like really
 

7207
03:04:43,720 --> 03:04:46,950
wanted to do like he felt like really
depressed and and lost and like

03:04:46,950 --> 03:04:46,960
depressed and and lost and like
 

7209
03:04:46,960 --> 03:04:48,670
depressed and and lost and like
pointless

7210
03:04:48,670 --> 03:04:48,680
pointless
 

7211
03:04:48,680 --> 03:04:50,190
pointless
when he knew he had cancer and he was

7212
03:04:50,190 --> 03:04:50,200
when he knew he had cancer and he was
 

7213
03:04:50,200 --> 03:04:52,110
when he knew he had cancer and he was
going to die and he was living this

7214
03:04:52,110 --> 03:04:52,120
going to die and he was living this
 

7215
03:04:52,120 --> 03:04:54,389
going to die and he was living this
shitty life with all these jobs that

7216
03:04:54,389 --> 03:04:54,399
shitty life with all these jobs that
 

7217
03:04:54,399 --> 03:04:56,030
shitty life with all these jobs that
were treating him like

7218
03:04:56,030 --> 03:04:56,040
were treating him like
 

7219
03:04:56,040 --> 03:04:58,710
were treating him like
[\h__\h] and then he saw the glimpse into

7220
03:04:58,710 --> 03:04:58,720
[\h__\h] and then he saw the glimpse into
 

7221
03:04:58,720 --> 03:04:59,469
[\h__\h] and then he saw the glimpse into
the

7222
03:04:59,469 --> 03:04:59,479
the
 

7223
03:04:59,479 --> 03:05:02,870
the
other side that he has never seen before

7224
03:05:02,870 --> 03:05:02,880
other side that he has never seen before
 

7225
03:05:02,880 --> 03:05:05,670
other side that he has never seen before
and he was like [\h__\h] it like I'm going

7226
03:05:05,670 --> 03:05:05,680
and he was like [\h__\h] it like I'm going
 

7227
03:05:05,680 --> 03:05:07,070
and he was like [\h__\h] it like I'm going
to look into that because that looks

7228
03:05:07,070 --> 03:05:07,080
to look into that because that looks
 

7229
03:05:07,080 --> 03:05:10,309
to look into that because that looks
kind of fun with my knowledge and like

7230
03:05:10,309 --> 03:05:10,319
kind of fun with my knowledge and like
 

7231
03:05:10,319 --> 03:05:11,950
kind of fun with my knowledge and like
for him it doesn't it's not about the

7232
03:05:11,950 --> 03:05:11,960
for him it doesn't it's not about the
 

7233
03:05:11,960 --> 03:05:16,309
for him it doesn't it's not about the
money at all at least in in that first

7234
03:05:16,309 --> 03:05:16,319
money at all at least in in that first
 

7235
03:05:16,319 --> 03:05:18,309
money at all at least in in that first
like his decision to go there in the

7236
03:05:18,309 --> 03:05:18,319
like his decision to go there in the
 

7237
03:05:18,319 --> 03:05:20,269
like his decision to go there in the
first place is not for money I think

7238
03:05:20,269 --> 03:05:20,279
first place is not for money I think
 

7239
03:05:20,279 --> 03:05:22,510
first place is not for money I think
maybe later on because he needs to pay

7240
03:05:22,510 --> 03:05:22,520
maybe later on because he needs to pay
 

7241
03:05:22,520 --> 03:05:25,070
maybe later on because he needs to pay
for his treatment I suppose but at first

7242
03:05:25,070 --> 03:05:25,080
for his treatment I suppose but at first
 

7243
03:05:25,080 --> 03:05:26,389
for his treatment I suppose but at first
it's really just

7244
03:05:26,389 --> 03:05:26,399
it's really just
 

7245
03:05:26,399 --> 03:05:30,190
it's really just
about like how meaningless his life

7246
03:05:30,190 --> 03:05:30,200
about like how meaningless his life
 

7247
03:05:30,200 --> 03:05:32,070
about like how meaningless his life
seems to him in that moment and what's

7248
03:05:32,070 --> 03:05:32,080
seems to him in that moment and what's
 

7249
03:05:32,080 --> 03:05:36,150
seems to him in that moment and what's
the point of continuing this when I'm

7250
03:05:36,150 --> 03:05:36,160
the point of continuing this when I'm
 

7251
03:05:36,160 --> 03:05:39,229
the point of continuing this when I'm
dying anyway yeah I understand it I got

7252
03:05:39,229 --> 03:05:39,239
dying anyway yeah I understand it I got
