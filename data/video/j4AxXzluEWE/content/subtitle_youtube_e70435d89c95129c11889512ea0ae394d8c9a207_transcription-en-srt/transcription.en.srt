doors okay well
 

197
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:27,070
doors okay well
that'll that'll

198
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:27,080

 

199
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,230

help but I don't know if I should make

200
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:29,240
help but I don't know if I should make
 

201
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,189
help but I don't know if I should make
all of it into stone bricks cuz it's

202
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:31,199
all of it into stone bricks cuz it's
 

203
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,749
all of it into stone bricks cuz it's
nice to have some texture well we can

204
00:06:32,749 --> 00:06:32,759
nice to have some texture well we can
 

205
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,629
nice to have some texture well we can
worry about that

206
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:35,639
worry about that
 

207
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:38,110
worry about that
later also I think I have a bunch of

208
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:38,120
later also I think I have a bunch of
 

209
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,589
later also I think I have a bunch of
money that I can use for the

210
00:06:39,589 --> 00:06:39,599
money that I can use for the
 

211
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:42,110
money that I can use for the
construction packs cuz only 3,000 of

212
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:42,120
construction packs cuz only 3,000 of
 

213
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,070
construction packs cuz only 3,000 of
this belongs to the

214
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,080

 

215
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:53,870

lottery yes some moss

216
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:53,880

 

217
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,950

stone

218
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:55,960
stone
 

219
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:02,189
stone
gosh what are we thinking

220
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:02,199

 

221
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:05,670

so wouldn't it be cool to put it on a

222
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:05,680
so wouldn't it be cool to put it on a
 

223
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,430
so wouldn't it be cool to put it on a
diagonal I'm so tempted to put it on a

224
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:08,440
diagonal I'm so tempted to put it on a
 

225
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:14,749
diagonal I'm so tempted to put it on a
diagonal but that's probably a bad

226
00:07:14,749 --> 00:07:14,759

 

227
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:18,230

idea cuz we want like a cool pathway you

228
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:18,240
idea cuz we want like a cool pathway you
 

229
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,670
idea cuz we want like a cool pathway you
know leading up to

230
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:20,680
know leading up to
 

231
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,510
know leading up to
it that would be hard but diagonal

232
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:24,520
it that would be hard but diagonal
 

233
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,150
it that would be hard but diagonal

it on the grid so if you put it

244
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:37,160
it on the grid so if you put it
 

245
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:42,029
it on the grid so if you put it
diagonally it looks really

246
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:42,039

 

247
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:46,589

cool I'm up for it I should give it a

248
00:07:46,589 --> 00:07:46,599
cool I'm up for it I should give it a
 

249
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:50,589
cool I'm up for it I should give it a
go I mean what's the worst that could

250
00:07:50,589 --> 00:07:50,599
go I mean what's the worst that could
 

251
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:52,790
go I mean what's the worst that could
happen I guess it's like how do you do

252
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:52,800
happen I guess it's like how do you do
 

253
00:07:52,800 --> 00:08:00,510
happen I guess it's like how do you do
the doors

255
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,710

it's the world tree on a diagonal the

256
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:02,720
it's the world tree on a diagonal the
 

257
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,390
it's the world tree on a diagonal the
world tree is an organic shape that does

I I flew too close to the Sun
 

271
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,469
I I flew too close to the Sun
ouch oh dear okay I've learned my lesson

272
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:40,479
ouch oh dear okay I've learned my lesson
 

273
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,870
ouch oh dear okay I've learned my lesson
don't try to see what lurks beyond the

274
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:43,880
don't try to see what lurks beyond the
 

275
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,389
don't try to see what lurks beyond the
walls your mortal mind was not

276
00:08:47,389 --> 00:08:47,399
walls your mortal mind was not
 

277
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:50,750
walls your mortal mind was not
made to

278
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:50,760

 

279
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,070

see how

280
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:54,080
see how
 

281
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,630
see how
symbolic see I feel like a diagonal

282
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:56,640
symbolic see I feel like a diagonal
 

283
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:03,150
symbolic see I feel like a diagonal
would be really cool

284
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:03,160

 

285
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,150

but how do we make see wouldn't it it

286
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:05,160
but how do we make see wouldn't it it
 

287
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,190
but how do we make see wouldn't it it
would make so much sense like

288
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:08,200
would make so much sense like
 

289
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:13,670
would make so much sense like
this how do we do the the entrance

290
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:13,680
this how do we do the the entrance
 

291
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,910
this how do we do the the entrance
then it just leads your eye nicely

292
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:16,920
then it just leads your eye nicely
 

293
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:23,069
then it just leads your eye nicely
doesn't

294
00:09:23,069 --> 00:09:23,079

 

295
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:27,069

it think about the

296
00:09:27,069 --> 00:09:27,079

 

297
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:34,150

bookshelves I'm thinking

298
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,160

 

299
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,230

double doors with one pressure plate

300
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:37,240
double doors with one pressure plate
 

301
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:42,310
double doors with one pressure plate
would that look cool or would that look

302
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:42,320

 

303
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,350

weird you know what let's just go for it

304
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:45,360
weird you know what let's just go for it
 

305
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,430
weird you know what let's just go for it
1 2 3 4 five 6 7 8 9 10 but remember

306
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:50,440
1 2 3 4 five 6 7 8 9 10 but remember
 

307
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:55,949
1 2 3 4 five 6 7 8 9 10 but remember
diagonals are bigger than than

308
00:09:55,949 --> 00:09:55,959

 

309
00:09:55,959 --> 00:09:59,990

straight uh one let's just see two three

310
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,000
straight uh one let's just see two three
 

311
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,790
straight uh one let's just see two three
four five 6 7 8 9 10 because of

312
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:04,800
four five 6 7 8 9 10 because of
 

313
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,430
four five 6 7 8 9 10 because of
Pythagoras diagonals

314
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:07,440
Pythagoras diagonals
 

315
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,230
Pythagoras diagonals
are are

316
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:09,240
are are
 

317
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,430
are are
bigger so don't let it fool

318
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:13,440
bigger so don't let it fool
 

319
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,470
bigger so don't let it fool
you we making a

320
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:17,480

 

321
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,230

Rus well geometry

322
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:20,240
Rus well geometry
 

323
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,870
Rus well geometry
is is

324
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:22,880
is is
 

325
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:28,310
is is
another important aspect of

326
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:28,320

 

327
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,470

Education so I feel like doesn't this

328
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:30,480
Education so I feel like doesn't this
 

329
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,350
Education so I feel like doesn't this
fill the space so nicely actually I

330
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:32,360
fill the space so nicely actually I
 

331
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,790
fill the space so nicely actually I
think it could be a little

332
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:35,800

 

333
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:40,629

bigger

334
00:10:40,629 --> 00:10:40,639

 

335
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:48,150

maybe what if it was too

336
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:48,160

 

337
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,710

bigger am I infringing on the The

00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:51,720
bigger am I infringing on the The
 

339
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,190
bigger am I infringing on the The
Gallows

340
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:54,200
Gallows
 

341
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,829
Gallows
space wait this is way too big isn't

342
00:10:57,829 --> 00:10:57,839
space wait this is way too big isn't
 

343
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,310

it am I going to have enough am I going

344
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:00,320
it am I going to have enough am I going
 

345
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,069
it am I going to have enough am I going
to have enough resources to build

346

2434
01:23:40,870 --> 01:23:40,880

 

2435
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:48,590

there so I'm thinking

2436
01:23:48,590 --> 01:23:48,600

 

2437
01:23:48,600 --> 01:24:00,430

like something like this

2438
01:24:00,430 --> 01:24:00,440

 

2439
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:05,270

and

2440
01:24:05,270 --> 01:24:05,280

 

2441
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:12,310

then yes and then just like build the

2442
01:24:12,310 --> 01:24:12,320

 

2443
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:14,669

pathway

2444
01:24:14,669 --> 01:24:14,679
pathway
 

2445
01:24:14,679 --> 01:24:16,950
pathway
out and then it probably goes like

2446
01:24:16,950 --> 01:24:16,960
out and then it probably goes like
 

2447
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:20,430
out and then it probably goes like
further but you

2448
01:24:20,430 --> 01:24:20,440
further but you
 

2449
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:27,030
further but you
know worry about that later

2450
01:24:27,030 --> 01:24:27,040

 

2451
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:32,790

and then I think we need like

2452
01:24:32,790 --> 01:24:32,800

 

2453
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:39,870

sort needs a sign it does need a sign

2456
01:24:43,669 --> 01:24:43,679
sort needs a sign it does need a sign
 

2457
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:47,830
sort needs a sign it does need a sign
