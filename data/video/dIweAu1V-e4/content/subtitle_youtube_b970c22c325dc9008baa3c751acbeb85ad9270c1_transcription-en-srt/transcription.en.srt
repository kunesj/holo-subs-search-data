2987
01:24:03,199 --> 01:24:07,590
just like triggering
it's something all right

2988
01:24:07,590 --> 01:24:07,600

 

2989
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:10,149

yeah because it triggers so hard that it
 

2997
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:18,950
yeah because it triggers so hard that it
drags out the game but having two

2998
01:24:18,950 --> 01:24:18,960
drags out the game but having two
 

2999
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:21,189
drags out the game but having two
of the same deck and against each other

3000
01:24:21,189 --> 01:24:21,199
of the same deck and against each other
 

3001
01:24:21,199 --> 01:24:22,229
of the same deck and against each other
is even more

3002
01:24:22,229 --> 01:24:22,239
is even more
 

3003
01:24:22,239 --> 01:24:25,270
is even more
cancer yeah it's pretty

3004
01:24:25,270 --> 01:24:25,280
cancer yeah it's pretty
 

3005
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:31,030
cancer yeah it's pretty
it's pretty intense

3006
01:24:31,030 --> 01:24:31,040
it's pretty intense
 

3007
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:33,510
it's pretty intense
but i should have maybe um prepared one

3008
01:24:33,510 --> 01:24:33,520
but i should have maybe um prepared one
 

3009
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:34,629
but i should have maybe um prepared one
more

3010
01:24:34,629 --> 01:24:34,639
more
 

3011
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:37,189
more
dick i thought i thought one was enough

3012
01:24:37,189 --> 01:24:37,199
dick i thought i thought one was enough
 

3013
01:24:37,199 --> 01:24:38,709
dick i thought i thought one was enough
and one more deck would have been fun i

3014
01:24:38,709 --> 01:24:38,719
and one more deck would have been fun i
 

3015
01:24:38,719 --> 01:24:39,510
and one more deck would have been fun i
guess to

3016
01:24:39,510 --> 01:24:39,520
guess to
 

3017
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:43,030
guess to
play around a bit more

3018
01:24:43,030 --> 01:24:43,040

 

3019
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:45,830

maybe if there's next time or for the

3020
01:24:45,830 --> 01:24:45,840
maybe if there's next time or for the
 

3021
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:47,510
maybe if there's next time or for the
tournament who knows maybe i'll get

3022
01:24:47,510 --> 01:24:47,520
tournament who knows maybe i'll get
 

3023
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:48,470
tournament who knows maybe i'll get
another deck or

3024
01:24:48,470 --> 01:24:48,480
another deck or
 

3025
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:50,070
another deck or
i wonder if you're only allowed to use

3026
01:24:50,070 --> 01:24:50,080
i wonder if you're only allowed to use
 

3027
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:52,390
i wonder if you're only allowed to use
one deck in a tournament

3028
01:24:52,390 --> 01:24:52,400
one deck in a tournament
 

3029
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:54,229
one deck in a tournament
but yeah i think that's a good question

3030
01:24:54,229 --> 01:24:54,239
but yeah i think that's a good question
 

3031
01:24:54,239 --> 01:24:58,390
but yeah i think that's a good question
i'm not sure

3032
01:24:58,390 --> 01:24:58,400
i'm not sure
 

3033
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:00,629
i'm not sure
also i wonder who our opponents will be

3034
01:25:00,629 --> 01:25:00,639
also i wonder who our opponents will be
 

3035
01:25:00,639 --> 01:25:02,629
also i wonder who our opponents will be
just random people

3036
01:25:02,629 --> 01:25:02,639
just random people
 

3037
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:05,830
just random people
oh yeah i wonder too oh i mean i doubt

3038
01:25:05,830 --> 01:25:05,840
oh yeah i wonder too oh i mean i doubt
 

3039
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:07,270
oh yeah i wonder too oh i mean i doubt
they'll be random people i bet that

3040
01:25:07,270 --> 01:25:07,280
they'll be random people i bet that
 

3041
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:08,310
they'll be random people i bet that
they'll be people who are very

3042
01:25:08,310 --> 01:25:08,320
they'll be people who are very
 

3043
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:11,189
they'll be people who are very
experienced at the game

3044
01:25:11,189 --> 01:25:11,199
experienced at the game
 

3045
01:25:11,199 --> 01:25:12,870
experienced at the game
