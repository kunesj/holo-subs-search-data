That was divine

00:00:46,986 --> 00:00:48,253
Exquisite!

27
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,286
So you say you know many languages?

00:00:51,286 --> 00:00:52,020
That’s great!

29
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,020

00:01:00,353 --> 00:01:01,686
What can you do?

00:01:03,653 --> 00:01:04,820
Ohhhhh!

39
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:05,620
DAMN!!!

40
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,220
That’s pretty good!

41
00:01:07,386 --> 00:01:09,086
Why do you want to work here?

42
00:01:09,086 --> 00:01:10,020

Hmm?

45
00:01:11,886 --> 00:01:12,753
What’s wrong?

46
00:01:12,753 --> 00:01:14,586
You seem like you're hesitating

47
00:01:14,586 --> 00:01:15,486
Just tell the truth!

48
00:01:15,486 --> 00:01:16,486
We will accept it

49
00:01:16,486 --> 00:01:17,486
Don’t worry

50
00:01:18,986 --> 00:01:20,086
Well...

51
00:01:20,086 --> 00:01:20,886

Unbelievable!

57
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:28,920
You just a spy from Takobell?

58
00:01:28,953 --> 00:01:29,953
Oh... God dammit

59
00:01:29,953 --> 00:01:31,553

63
00:01:35,086 --> 00:01:37,486
Are you another useless chicken?

64
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:37,886
No...

00:01:37,886 --> 00:01:38,320

00:01:46,653 --> 00:01:47,653
Ohh?

74
00:01:47,686 --> 00:01:49,686
I protested in front of other stores

75
00:01:49,686 --> 00:01:51,920
While holding a standing sign of you!

76
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,320

The act of you holding the sign of me in front of the rivals?

00:02:13,886 --> 00:02:15,053
Excellent!

91
00:02:15,053 --> 00:02:15,753
