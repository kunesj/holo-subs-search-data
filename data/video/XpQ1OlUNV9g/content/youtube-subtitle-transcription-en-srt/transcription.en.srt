bit the thing is like spikes might not
 

3021
01:32:43,119 --> 01:32:45,990
bit the thing is like spikes might not
be so useful anymore because we're going

3022
01:32:45,990 --> 01:32:46,000
be so useful anymore because we're going
 

3023
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,550

thinking our strategy should be modes so

3030
01:32:57,750 --> 01:32:57,760

3031
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:01,229

that they fall into the holes they fall

3032
01:33:01,229 --> 01:33:01,239
that they fall into the holes they fall
 

3033
01:33:01,239 --> 01:33:03,390
that they fall into the holes they fall
into those pretty easily and they don't

3035
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:06,350
into those pretty easily and they don't
seem to be able to get out of them so we

3036
01:33:06,350 --> 01:33:06,360
seem to be able to get out of them so we
 

3037

Fields but only one is spikes that could

6830
03:21:11,950 --> 03:21:11,960
Fields but only one is spikes that could
 

6831
03:21:11,960 --> 03:21:17,750
Fields but only one is spikes that could
work yeah single wall spike okay ah also

6832

iron oh there's a bunch of gunpowder in
 

6851
03:21:56,359 --> 03:21:58,469
iron oh there's a bunch of gunpowder in
one of our

6852
03:21:58,469 --> 03:21:58,479
one of our
 

6853
03:21:58,479 --> 03:22:03,790
one of our
chests

6854
03:22:03,790 --> 03:22:03,800

 

6855
03:22:03,800 --> 03:22:07,910

yeah but you you can make bullet casings

6856
03:22:07,910 --> 03:22:07,920
yeah but you you can make bullet casings
 

6857
03:22:07,920 --> 03:22:08,830
yeah but you you can make bullet casings
in the

6858
03:22:08,830 --> 03:22:08,840
in the
 

6859
03:22:08,840 --> 03:22:11,590
in the
Forge mhm with the brass gu oh brass and

6860
03:22:11,590 --> 03:22:11,600
Forge mhm with the brass gu oh brass and
 

6861
03:22:11,600 --> 03:22:14,590
Forge mhm with the brass gu oh brass and
clay and we have so much of that mhm

6862
03:22:14,590 --> 03:22:14,600
clay and we have so much of that mhm
 

6863
03:22:14,600 --> 03:22:18,630
clay and we have so much of that mhm
so that's easy

6864
03:22:18,630 --> 03:22:18,640

 

6865
03:22:18,640 --> 03:22:21,870

so just bullet tip and gunpowder bullet

6866
03:22:21,870 --> 03:22:21,880
so just bullet tip and gunpowder bullet
 

6867
03:22:21,880 --> 03:22:23,590
so just bullet tip and gunpowder bullet
tip

6868
03:22:23,590 --> 03:22:23,600
tip
 

6869
03:22:23,600 --> 03:22:26,429
tip
uh is lead and

6870
03:22:26,429 --> 03:22:26,439
uh is lead and
 

6871
03:22:26,439 --> 03:22:28,630
uh is lead and
Clay so you can make that in the Forge

6872
03:22:28,630 --> 03:22:28,640
Clay so you can make that in the Forge
 

6873
03:22:28,640 --> 03:22:31,150
Clay so you can make that in the Forge
as well so basically we just need

6874
03:22:31,150 --> 03:22:31,160
as well so basically we just need
 

6875
03:22:31,160 --> 03:22:34,550
as well so basically we just need
gunpowder I think that's possible

6876
03:22:34,550 --> 03:22:34,560
gunpowder I think that's possible
 

6877
03:22:34,560 --> 03:22:44,030
gunpowder I think that's possible
too maybe I should put out a second

6878
03:22:44,030 --> 03:22:44,040

 

6879
03:22:44,040 --> 03:22:47,150

Forge good

6880
03:22:47,150 --> 03:22:47,160
Forge good
 

6881
03:22:47,160 --> 03:22:51,550
Forge good
I could maybe I will oh I have a lot

I could maybe I will oh I have a lot
of I can make some bullets now if

6884
03:22:54,750 --> 03:22:54,760
of I can make some bullets now if
 

6885
03:22:54,760 --> 03:22:57,990
of I can make some bullets now if
anybody needs any or I'll wait

normal one I think cuz I'm guessing that

6906
03:23:31,229 --> 03:23:31,239
normal one I think cuz I'm guessing that
 

6907
03:23:31,239 --> 03:23:33,950
normal one I think cuz I'm guessing that
takes less resources okay I'm going to

6908
03:23:33,950 --> 03:23:33,960
takes less resources okay I'm going to
 

6909
03:23:33,960 --> 03:23:36,990
takes less resources okay I'm going to
make I'm going to make some 762 for you

6910
03:23:36,990 --> 03:23:37,000
make I'm going to make some 762 for you
 

6911
03:23:37,000 --> 03:23:40,590
make I'm going to make some 762 for you
first and

6912
03:23:40,590 --> 03:23:40,600
first and
 

6913
03:23:40,600 --> 03:23:44,030
first and
okay and then once we get

6914
03:23:44,030 --> 03:23:44,040
okay and then once we get
 

6915
03:23:44,040 --> 03:23:48,870
okay and then once we get
more materials we can yay do

6916
03:23:48,870 --> 03:23:48,880
more materials we can yay do
 

6917
03:23:48,880 --> 03:23:52,670
more materials we can yay do
collectors filters that will be

6918
03:23:52,670 --> 03:23:52,680
collectors filters that will be
 

6919
03:23:52,680 --> 03:23:55,150
collectors filters that will be
useful yay we don't have to boil the

6920
03:23:55,150 --> 03:23:55,160
useful yay we don't have to boil the
 

6921
03:23:55,160 --> 03:23:58,790
useful yay we don't have to boil the
water

6922

good okay I'm making a second Forge so
 

6933
03:24:14,040 --> 03:24:16,910
good okay I'm making a second Forge so
that we can um

6934
03:24:16,910 --> 03:24:16,920
that we can um
 

6935
03:24:16,920 --> 03:24:21,229

somewhere within the circle perimeter oh
 

7515
03:40:24,359 --> 03:40:27,150
somewhere within the circle perimeter oh
this better be worth it

7516
03:40:27,150 --> 03:40:27,160
this better be worth it
 

7517
03:40:27,160 --> 03:40:30,189
