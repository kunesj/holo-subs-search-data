690
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:00,959

 

691
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,030

this is not only this resort

this is not only this resort
 

693
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,590
this is not only this resort
i'm 100 sure that the other resorts on

694
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:05,600
i'm 100 sure that the other resorts on
 

695
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,590
i'm 100 sure that the other resorts on
in the maldives on those islands do that

696
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:07,600
in the maldives on those islands do that

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,549
in the maldives on those islands do that
too

698
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:08,559
too
 

699
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:09,429
too
but

700
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:09,439
but
 

701
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,549
but
they definitely take advantage of the

702
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:12,559
they definitely take advantage of the
 

703
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,270
they definitely take advantage of the
fact that you're on an island

704
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:15,280
fact that you're on an island
 

705
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,350
fact that you're on an island
and if you would want to go to the main

706
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:17,360
and if you would want to go to the main
 

707
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,909
and if you would want to go to the main
island to do some cheap shopping it

708
00:17:19,909 --> 00:17:19,919
island to do some cheap shopping it
 

709
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,309
island to do some cheap shopping it
would cost you like depending on which

711
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,069

300 to 800 bucks to get back to the main

715
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,230
300 to 800 bucks to get back to the main
island and then again it's not worth it

716
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:30,240
island and then again it's not worth it
 

717
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,390

00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:15,029
it looks
fine except for like a lot of

1372
00:30:15,029 --> 00:30:15,039
fine except for like a lot of

clipping of the arms into the body and
 

1375
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,149
clipping of the arms into the body and
all that

1376
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:18,159
all that
 

1377
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:20,070
all that
but but see that's another thing that we

1378
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:20,080
but but see that's another thing that we
 

1379
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,990
but but see that's another thing that we
might be able to fix in the technical

1380
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:22,000
might be able to fix in the technical
 

1381
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,269
might be able to fix in the technical
after editing um but still it it

1382
00:30:25,269 --> 00:30:25,279
after editing um but still it it
 

1383
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:29,190
after editing um but still it it
obviously won't be like as good as

1384
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:29,200
obviously won't be like as good as
 

1385
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,190
obviously won't be like as good as
the 3d streams you see from whole live

1386
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:31,200
the 3d streams you see from whole live
 

1387
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,669
the 3d streams you see from whole live
japan members but

1388
00:30:33,669 --> 00:30:33,679
japan members but
 

1389
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,389
japan members but
that means you know i i always had this

1390
00:30:36,389 --> 00:30:36,399
that means you know i i always had this
 

1391
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:37,990
that means you know i i always had this
feeling that

1392
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:38,000
feeling that
 

1393
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,070
feeling that
i want things to happen in the right

1394
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:40,080
i want things to happen in the right
 

1395
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,029
i want things to happen in the right
traditional order right so 3dw

1396
00:30:43,029 --> 00:30:43,039
traditional order right so 3dw
 

1397
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,430
traditional order right so 3dw
should be before everything else

1398
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:45,440
should be before everything else
 

1399
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,029
should be before everything else
happening with 3d so at least

1400
00:30:49,029 --> 00:30:49,039
happening with 3d so at least
 

1401
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,990
happening with 3d so at least
if we do it this way with the suit which

1402
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:52,000
if we do it this way with the suit which
 

1403
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,470
if we do it this way with the suit which
is lower quality than studio quality

1404
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:54,480
is lower quality than studio quality
 

1405
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,269
is lower quality than studio quality
then it means that we can at least still

1406
00:30:57,269 --> 00:30:57,279
then it means that we can at least still
 

1407
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:00,470
then it means that we can at least still
have like a a proper studio

1408
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:00,480
have like a a proper studio
 

1409
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,350
have like a a proper studio
debut stream sometime and it will make

1410
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:03,360
debut stream sometime and it will make
 

1411
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,070
debut stream sometime and it will make
some sense because you will not have

1412
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:06,080
some sense because you will not have
 

1413
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,190
some sense because you will not have
seen

1414
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:07,200

01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:09,990
island way way way way earlier and we
were thinking when we were choosing the

3180
01:07:09,990 --> 01:07:10,000

flights we were just we didn't know yet
um about how

3184
01:07:15,029 --> 01:07:15,039

01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:18,069
to get to the island and how to leave
the island we thought that maybe we

3188
01:07:18,069 --> 01:07:18,079
the island we thought that maybe we
 

3189
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:19,910
the island we thought that maybe we
could stay like all day

3190
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:19,920
could stay like all day
 

3191
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:22,309

01:07:22,309 --> 01:07:22,319
possibly on the beach just chill until
 

3193
01:07:22,319 --> 01:07:23,990
possibly on the beach just chill until
the flight so we should make the most

3194
01:07:23,990 --> 01:07:24,000
the flight so we should make the most
 

3195
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,990
the flight so we should make the most
out of that day and just leave as late

3196
01:07:25,990 --> 01:07:26,000
out of that day and just leave as late
 

3197
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,270
out of that day and just leave as late

as possible
 

3199
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:29,109
as possible
um but the latest like there was even

3200
01:07:29,109 --> 01:07:29,119
um but the latest like there was even
 

3201
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:31,109
um but the latest like there was even
like a i think if i remember correctly i

3202
01:07:31,109 --> 01:07:31,119
like a i think if i remember correctly i
 

3203
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:33,510
like a i think if i remember correctly i
think there was like a really early um

3204
01:07:33,510 --> 01:07:33,520
think there was like a really early um
 

3205
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:34,549
think there was like a really early um
plane

3206
01:07:34,549 --> 01:07:34,559
plane
 

3207
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:35,910
plane
too early

3208
01:07:35,910 --> 01:07:35,920
too early
 

3209
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:38,309
too early
so we would have lost the whole day

3210
01:07:38,309 --> 01:07:38,319
so we would have lost the whole day
 

3211
01:07:38,319 --> 01:07:40,630
so we would have lost the whole day
or a really late one

3212

or a really late one
 

3213
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:44,470

but that one has insane transit and i
 

3215
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:46,950
but that one has insane transit and i
was like

and and you know what i just don't think
 

3327
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:58,310
and and you know what i just don't think
it's worth it because those were in

3328
01:09:58,310 --> 01:09:58,320
it's worth it because those were in
 

3329

it's worth it because those were in
theory the the flights itself are short

3330
01:10:00,390 --> 01:10:00,400

theory the the flights itself are short
like what five six hours i don't think

like what five six hours i don't think
 

3333
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:04,870
like what five six hours i don't think
it's worth

3334
01:10:04,870 --> 01:10:04,880
it's worth
 

3335
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:06,229
it's worth
like paying

because you're getting out of the plane

3342
01:10:14,470 --> 01:10:14,480
because you're getting out of the plane
 

3343

i just don't see the value
 

3347
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:20,630
i just don't see the value
in it

3348
01:10:20,630 --> 01:10:20,640
in it
 

3349
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:23,350
in it
for like a seat where you can recline

uh and that's those are 12 hour flights
if i could

3366
01:10:38,390 --> 01:10:38,400
if i could
 

3367
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:39,350
if i could
i would

3368
01:10:39,350 --> 01:10:39,360
i would
 

3369
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:40,709
i would
want to

3370
01:10:40,709 --> 01:10:40,719
want to
 

3371
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:44,310
want to
not go with economy

3372
01:10:44,310 --> 01:10:44,320
not go with economy
 

3373
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:46,470
not go with economy
because that that at least makes a

3374
01:10:46,470 --> 01:10:46,480
because that that at least makes a
 

3375
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:51,430
because that that at least makes a
difference 12 hours or so in economy

3376
01:10:51,430 --> 01:10:51,440
difference 12 hours or so in economy
 

3377
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:53,750
difference 12 hours or so in economy
can be very painful especially with

yeah and i think because of that a lot
 

9085
03:09:22,720 --> 03:09:25,750
