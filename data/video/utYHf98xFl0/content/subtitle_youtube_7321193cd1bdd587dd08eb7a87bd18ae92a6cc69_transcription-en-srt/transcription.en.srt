if you can can get your cats to call the
 

3365
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:48,310
if you can can get your cats to call the
ambulance probably in some way maybe but

3366
01:33:48,310 --> 01:33:48,320
ambulance probably in some way maybe but
 

3367
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:50,470
ambulance probably in some way maybe but
do you really want to rely on the cat to

3368
01:33:50,470 --> 01:33:50,480
do you really want to rely on the cat to
 

3369
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:52,910
do you really want to rely on the cat to
call the ambulance for for you I think

3370
01:33:52,910 --> 01:33:52,920
call the ambulance for for you I think
 

3371
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:54,590
call the ambulance for for you I think
for dogss you could train them like you

3372
01:33:54,590 --> 01:33:54,600
for dogss you could train them like you
 

3373
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:56,629
for dogss you could train them like you
could have some kind of like big red

3374
01:33:56,629 --> 01:33:56,639
could have some kind of like big red
 

3375
01:33:56,639 --> 01:34:01,310
could have some kind of like big red
button somewhere in your house and then

3376
01:34:01,310 --> 01:34:01,320
button somewhere in your house and then
 

3377
01:34:01,320 --> 01:34:03,990
button somewhere in your house and then
train them if you're like on the ground

3378
01:34:03,990 --> 01:34:04,000
train them if you're like on the ground
 

3379
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,790
train them if you're like on the ground
not reacting to push the button and that

3380
01:34:06,790 --> 01:34:06,800
not reacting to push the button and that
 

3381
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:09,390
not reacting to push the button and that
would connect to an ambulance call or

3382
01:34:09,390 --> 01:34:09,400
would connect to an ambulance call or
 

3383
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:12,070
would connect to an ambulance call or
so that probably works yeah but for cats

footwork and then there's kind of like
 

6203
02:48:36,520 --> 02:48:39,710
footwork and then there's kind of like
similar moves and then there's like you

6204

similar moves and then there's like you
 

6205
02:48:39,720 --> 02:48:42,710
similar moves and then there's like you
start these moves in a certain order but

6206
02:48:42,710 --> 02:48:42,720
start these moves in a certain order but
 

6207
02:48:42,720 --> 02:48:46,150
start these moves in a certain order but
then in the end of the um um song they

6208
02:48:46,150 --> 02:48:46,160
then in the end of the um um song they
 

6209

then in the end of the um um song they
come up in a different order like like

02:48:49,990 --> 02:48:50,000
come up in a different order like like
 

6211
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:52,750
come up in a different order like like
for example after the

for example after the
chorus it it makes you think that it

6214
02:48:55,190 --> 02:48:55,200
chorus it it makes you think that it
 

6215
02:48:55,200 --> 02:48:58,490
chorus it it makes you think that it
goes into um

we had fun with it but that's probably

6318
02:51:21,429 --> 02:51:21,439
we had fun with it but that's probably
 

6319
02:51:21,439 --> 02:51:22,870
we had fun with it but that's probably
why you can see a little bit of a

6320
02:51:22,870 --> 02:51:22,880
why you can see a little bit of a
 

6321
02:51:22,880 --> 02:51:25,229
why you can see a little bit of a
difference between our dances because I

6322
02:51:25,229 --> 02:51:25,239
difference between our dances because I
 

6323
02:51:25,239 --> 02:51:27,790
difference between our dances because I
already knew it from long long time ago

6324
02:51:27,790 --> 02:51:27,800
already knew it from long long time ago
 

6325
02:51:27,800 --> 02:51:30,309
already knew it from long long time ago
so I was dancing it also probably more

6326
02:51:30,309 --> 02:51:30,319
so I was dancing it also probably more
 

6327
02:51:30,319 --> 02:51:32,269
so I was dancing it also probably more
energetically cuz I didn't have to think

6328
02:51:32,269 --> 02:51:32,279
energetically cuz I didn't have to think
 

6329
02:51:32,279 --> 02:51:37,790
energetically cuz I didn't have to think
so hard about the moves yeah so it's

6330
02:51:37,790 --> 02:51:37,800
so hard about the moves yeah so it's
 

6331
02:51:37,800 --> 02:51:39,630
so hard about the moves yeah so it's
it's not AI senpai's fault it was a

levitating platforms but they make
everything thing very complicated let's

moving thing that also made a lot of
things

6988
03:08:21,190 --> 03:08:21,200
things
 

6989
03:08:21,200 --> 03:08:24,990
things
complicated but let's not go into

6990
03:08:24,990 --> 03:08:25,000
complicated but let's not go into
 

6991
03:08:25,000 --> 03:08:28,389
complicated but let's not go into
detail uh but yeah I I I I was like

6992
03:08:28,389 --> 03:08:28,399
detail uh but yeah I I I I was like
 

6993
03:08:28,399 --> 03:08:30,309
detail uh but yeah I I I I was like
wondering H what song could I sing with

6994
03:08:30,309 --> 03:08:30,319
wondering H what song could I sing with
 

6995

wondering H what song could I sing with
these there's so many good hello project

6996
03:08:31,870 --> 03:08:31,880

songs that I want to sing but there were

6998
03:08:35,389 --> 03:08:35,399
songs that I want to sing but there were
 

6999
03:08:35,399 --> 03:08:38,030
songs that I want to sing but there were
two factors where I chose that song I

7000
03:08:38,030 --> 03:08:38,040
two factors where I chose that song I
 

7001
03:08:38,040 --> 03:08:40,710
two factors where I chose that song I
think one of them was well we're free

7002
03:08:40,710 --> 03:08:40,720
think one of them was well we're free
 

7003
03:08:40,720 --> 03:08:43,110
think one of them was well we're free
people so for me it was kind of an

7004
03:08:43,110 --> 03:08:43,120
people so for me it was kind of an
 

7005
03:08:43,120 --> 03:08:46,389
people so for me it was kind of an
obvious thing to go for a Bono song now

7006
03:08:46,389 --> 03:08:46,399
obvious thing to go for a Bono song now
 

7007
03:08:46,399 --> 03:08:49,910
obvious thing to go for a Bono song now
Bono has a few very famous songs and

7008
03:08:49,910 --> 03:08:49,920
Bono has a few very famous songs and
 

7009
03:08:49,920 --> 03:08:51,910
Bono has a few very famous songs and
this one is not necessarily one of their

7010
03:08:51,910 --> 03:08:51,920
this one is not necessarily one of their
 

7011
03:08:51,920 --> 03:08:55,590
this one is not necessarily one of their
most famous songs but I really like it

7012
03:08:55,590 --> 03:08:55,600
most famous songs but I really like it
 

7013
03:08:55,600 --> 03:09:00,110
most famous songs but I really like it
for its Vibe being kind of hype and you

7014
03:09:00,110 --> 03:09:00,120
for its Vibe being kind of hype and you
 

7015
03:09:00,120 --> 03:09:03,269
for its Vibe being kind of hype and you
know being kind of like a cheering song

7016
03:09:03,269 --> 03:09:03,279
know being kind of like a cheering song
 

7017
03:09:03,279 --> 03:09:06,790
know being kind of like a cheering song
where you guys can join in U but

7018
03:09:06,790 --> 03:09:06,800
where you guys can join in U but
 

7019
03:09:06,800 --> 03:09:10,070
where you guys can join in U but
also um the fact that they sing even in

7020
03:09:10,070 --> 03:09:10,080
also um the fact that they sing even in
 

7021
03:09:10,080 --> 03:09:14,870
also um the fact that they sing even in
the original they sing with these St in

7022
03:09:14,870 --> 03:09:14,880
the original they sing with these St in
 

7023
03:09:14,880 --> 03:09:17,590
the original they sing with these St in
microphones um so there's no Cho and I

7024
03:09:17,590 --> 03:09:17,600
microphones um so there's no Cho and I
 

7025
03:09:17,600 --> 03:09:19,110
microphones um so there's no Cho and I
thought that would make it easier for

7026
03:09:19,110 --> 03:09:19,120
thought that would make it easier for
 

7027
03:09:19,120 --> 03:09:21,429
thought that would make it easier for
myself cuz I already had so many coros

7028
03:09:21,429 --> 03:09:21,439
myself cuz I already had so many coros
 

7029
03:09:21,439 --> 03:09:22,150
myself cuz I already had so many coros
to

7030
03:09:22,150 --> 03:09:22,160
to
 

7031
03:09:22,160 --> 03:09:25,750
to
learn and so it would be good to have

7032
03:09:25,750 --> 03:09:25,760
learn and so it would be good to have
 

7033
03:09:25,760 --> 03:09:30,429
learn and so it would be good to have
like one song in there where there's no

7034
03:09:30,429 --> 03:09:30,439
like one song in there where there's no
 

7035
03:09:30,439 --> 03:09:32,990
like one song in there where there's no
Coro and I Could Just

7036
03:09:32,990 --> 03:09:33,000
Coro and I Could Just
 

7037
03:09:33,000 --> 03:09:36,710
Coro and I Could Just
Vibe yeah that was like one reason I

7038
03:09:36,710 --> 03:09:36,720
Vibe yeah that was like one reason I
 

7039
03:09:36,720 --> 03:09:40,269
Vibe yeah that was like one reason I
chose that to make it easier for me and

7040
03:09:40,269 --> 03:09:40,279
chose that to make it easier for me and
 

7041
03:09:40,279 --> 03:09:46,150
chose that to make it easier for me and
possibly also for the other two

7042
03:09:46,150 --> 03:09:46,160

 

7043
03:09:46,160 --> 03:09:49,150

uh yeah but I want to I want to make

7044
03:09:49,150 --> 03:09:49,160
uh yeah but I want to I want to make
 

7045
03:09:49,160 --> 03:09:51,910
uh yeah but I want to I want to make
more I want to cover more of bonus songs

7046
03:09:51,910 --> 03:09:51,920
more I want to cover more of bonus songs
 

7047
03:09:51,920 --> 03:09:54,429
more I want to cover more of bonus songs
and generally hello PR songs but in this

7048
03:09:54,429 --> 03:09:54,439
and generally hello PR songs but in this
 

7049
03:09:54,439 --> 03:09:56,349
and generally hello PR songs but in this
case I chose this one because of the

7050
03:09:56,349 --> 03:09:56,359
case I chose this one because of the
 

7051
03:09:56,359 --> 03:09:58,429
case I chose this one because of the
lack of

7052
03:09:58,429 --> 03:09:58,439
lack of
 

7053
03:09:58,439 --> 03:10:00,910
lack of
Coro and then I tried to make the whole

7054
03:10:00,910 --> 03:10:00,920
Coro and then I tried to make the whole
 

7055
03:10:00,920 --> 03:10:04,070
Coro and then I tried to make the whole
standing microphone thing um the gimmick

7056
03:10:04,070 --> 03:10:04,080
standing microphone thing um the gimmick
 

7057
03:10:04,080 --> 03:10:07,790
standing microphone thing um the gimmick
and uh I used the platforms because uh I

7058
03:10:07,790 --> 03:10:07,800
and uh I used the platforms because uh I
 

7059
03:10:07,800 --> 03:10:10,870
and uh I used the platforms because uh I
think um the reason you you guys were

7060
03:10:10,870 --> 03:10:10,880
think um the reason you you guys were
 

7061
03:10:10,880 --> 03:10:12,510
think um the reason you you guys were
pretty surprised about the platforms

7062
03:10:12,510 --> 03:10:12,520
pretty surprised about the platforms
 

7063
03:10:12,520 --> 03:10:13,590
pretty surprised about the platforms
right

7064
03:10:13,590 --> 03:10:13,600
right
 

7065
03:10:13,600 --> 03:10:16,510
right
I think a lot of people weren't aware

7066
03:10:16,510 --> 03:10:16,520
I think a lot of people weren't aware
 

7067
03:10:16,520 --> 03:10:19,590
I think a lot of people weren't aware
that these platforms could

7068
03:10:19,590 --> 03:10:19,600
that these platforms could
 

7069
03:10:19,600 --> 03:10:24,469
that these platforms could
move and um there's a reason for that

7070
03:10:24,469 --> 03:10:24,479
move and um there's a reason for that
 

7071
03:10:24,479 --> 03:10:26,950
move and um there's a reason for that
why it just why you guys were not aware

7072
03:10:26,950 --> 03:10:26,960
why it just why you guys were not aware
 

7073
03:10:26,960 --> 03:10:30,670
why it just why you guys were not aware
of it it's because

7074
03:10:30,670 --> 03:10:30,680
of it it's because
 

7075
03:10:30,680 --> 03:10:32,870
of it it's because
um it's

7076
03:10:32,870 --> 03:10:32,880
um it's
 

7077
03:10:32,880 --> 03:10:35,870
um it's
because nobody really used them until

7078
03:10:35,870 --> 03:10:35,880
because nobody really used them until
 

7079
03:10:35,880 --> 03:10:38,550
because nobody really used them until
now

7080
03:10:38,550 --> 03:10:38,560

 

7081
03:10:38,560 --> 03:10:41,990

because supposedly supposedly they're

7082
03:10:41,990 --> 03:10:42,000
because supposedly supposedly they're
 

7083
03:10:42,000 --> 03:10:43,750
because supposedly supposedly they're
kind of buggy

7084
03:10:43,750 --> 03:10:43,760
kind of buggy
 

7085
03:10:43,760 --> 03:10:45,670
kind of buggy
bugging out glitching

7086
03:10:45,670 --> 03:10:45,680
bugging out glitching
 

7087
03:10:45,680 --> 03:10:50,910
bugging out glitching
out thankfully it didn't happen in our

7088
03:10:50,910 --> 03:10:50,920
out thankfully it didn't happen in our
 

7089
03:10:50,920 --> 03:10:54,550
out thankfully it didn't happen in our
situation um so we kind of risked it I

7090
03:10:54,550 --> 03:10:54,560
situation um so we kind of risked it I
 

7091
03:10:54,560 --> 03:10:56,590
situation um so we kind of risked it I
asked them to risk it because I really

7092
03:10:56,590 --> 03:10:56,600
asked them to risk it because I really
 

7093
03:10:56,600 --> 03:10:59,830
asked them to risk it because I really
want to use them and to be honest this

7094
03:10:59,830 --> 03:10:59,840
want to use them and to be honest this
 

7095
03:10:59,840 --> 03:11:01,910
want to use them and to be honest this
stage already exists for quite a while

7096
03:11:01,910 --> 03:11:01,920
stage already exists for quite a while
 

7097
03:11:01,920 --> 03:11:04,429
stage already exists for quite a while
even before our Fredy showcases from

7098
03:11:04,429 --> 03:11:04,439
even before our Fredy showcases from
 

7099
03:11:04,439 --> 03:11:07,030
even before our Fredy showcases from
myth and back then I already wanted to

7100
03:11:07,030 --> 03:11:07,040
myth and back then I already wanted to
 

7101
03:11:07,040 --> 03:11:10,590
myth and back then I already wanted to
use them um and I think I actually did

7102
03:11:10,590 --> 03:11:10,600
use them um and I think I actually did
 

7103
03:11:10,600 --> 03:11:12,990
use them um and I think I actually did
use the middle stage but we couldn't

7104
03:11:12,990 --> 03:11:13,000
use the middle stage but we couldn't
 

7105
03:11:13,000 --> 03:11:16,030
use the middle stage but we couldn't
show it properly because it was

7106
03:11:16,030 --> 03:11:16,040
show it properly because it was
 

7107
03:11:16,040 --> 03:11:17,950
show it properly because it was
glitching and bugging back then already

7108
03:11:17,950 --> 03:11:17,960
glitching and bugging back then already
 

7109
03:11:17,960 --> 03:11:19,830
glitching and bugging back then already
and they were not sure if they could

7110
03:11:19,830 --> 03:11:19,840
and they were not sure if they could
 

7111
03:11:19,840 --> 03:11:22,630
and they were not sure if they could
show it properly so like only from a

7112
03:11:22,630 --> 03:11:22,640
show it properly so like only from a
 

7113
03:11:22,640 --> 03:11:23,670
show it properly so like only from a
certain

7114
03:11:23,670 --> 03:11:23,680
certain
 

7115
03:11:23,680 --> 03:11:27,229
certain
angle um and I asked them okay you know

7116
03:11:27,229 --> 03:11:27,239
angle um and I asked them okay you know
 

7117
03:11:27,239 --> 03:11:28,309
angle um and I asked them okay you know
but it would be nice if it would be

7118
03:11:28,309 --> 03:11:28,319
but it would be nice if it would be
 

7119
03:11:28,319 --> 03:11:30,030
but it would be nice if it would be
fixed in the

7120
03:11:30,030 --> 03:11:30,040
fixed in the
 

7121
03:11:30,040 --> 03:11:34,269
fixed in the
future now over half a year passed and I

7122
03:11:34,269 --> 03:11:34,279
future now over half a year passed and I
 

7123
03:11:34,279 --> 03:11:35,870
future now over half a year passed and I
don't think anybody worked on it and it

7124
03:11:35,870 --> 03:11:35,880
don't think anybody worked on it and it
 

7125
03:11:35,880 --> 03:11:37,670
don't think anybody worked on it and it
was still there the issue was still

7126
03:11:37,670 --> 03:11:37,680
was still there the issue was still
 

7127
03:11:37,680 --> 03:11:40,229
was still there the issue was still
there but I said well I want to use it

7128
03:11:40,229 --> 03:11:40,239
there but I said well I want to use it
 

7129
03:11:40,239 --> 03:11:41,670
there but I said well I want to use it
though because there's not really much I

7130
03:11:41,670 --> 03:11:41,680
though because there's not really much I
 

7131
03:11:41,680 --> 03:11:44,710
though because there's not really much I
can do with the stage I can be at the

7132
03:11:44,710 --> 03:11:44,720
can do with the stage I can be at the
 

7133
03:11:44,720 --> 03:11:47,030
can do with the stage I can be at the
top I can be at the bottom we don't have

7134
03:11:47,030 --> 03:11:47,040

the reflection on the platforms

7174
03:12:43,150 --> 03:12:43,160
the reflection on the platforms
 

7175
03:12:43,160 --> 03:12:46,150
the reflection on the platforms
when it's like lifted when it's not

7176
03:12:46,150 --> 03:12:46,160
when it's like lifted when it's not
 

7177
03:12:46,160 --> 03:12:48,429
when it's like lifted when it's not
integrated in the floor the reflection

7178
03:12:48,429 --> 03:12:48,439
integrated in the floor the reflection
 

7179
03:12:48,439 --> 03:12:52,550

wouldn't you wouldn't see the body in

7186
03:13:01,830 --> 03:13:01,840
wouldn't you wouldn't see the body in
 

7187
03:13:01,840 --> 03:13:04,750
wouldn't you wouldn't see the body in
there sometimes but it didn't happen at

7188
03:13:04,750 --> 03:13:04,760
there sometimes but it didn't happen at
 

7189

about we just do angles from below with
 

7195
03:13:12,600 --> 03:13:14,469
about we just do angles from below with
which will look cool anyway because if

7196
03:13:14,469 --> 03:13:14,479
which will look cool anyway because if
 

7197
03:13:14,479 --> 03:13:16,910
which will look cool anyway because if
we're like lifted up then you want to

7198

do lower angles anyway so let's just

7202
03:13:21,110 --> 03:13:21,120
do lower angles anyway so let's just
 

7203
03:13:21,120 --> 03:13:24,870
do lower angles anyway so let's just
show it in lower angles and see what

7204
03:13:24,870 --> 03:13:24,880
show it in lower angles and see what
 

7205
03:13:24,880 --> 03:13:27,670
show it in lower angles and see what
happens goes into

7206
03:13:27,670 --> 03:13:27,680
happens goes into
 

7207
03:13:27,680 --> 03:13:30,190
happens goes into

necessarily missing unless you look at
the

9296
04:11:06,030 --> 04:11:06,040
the
 

9297
04:11:06,040 --> 04:11:08,710

timer m
and then you got to consider that there

9300
04:11:09,990 --> 04:11:10,000
and then you got to consider that there
 

9301
04:11:10,000 --> 04:11:11,910
and then you got to consider that there
was a members only on

9302

15 minutes and honestly I thought
because I saw other members on course be

9310
