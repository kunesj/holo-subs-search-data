2549
01:24:11,239 --> 01:24:13,490
um and then I was like hmm
this is also

2550
01:24:13,490 --> 01:24:13,500
this is also
 

2551
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:16,010
this is also
maybe not quite what I envisioned but

2552
01:24:16,010 --> 01:24:16,020
maybe not quite what I envisioned but
 

2553
01:24:16,020 --> 01:24:17,270
maybe not quite what I envisioned but
it's very interesting it's very

2554
01:24:17,270 --> 01:24:17,280
it's very interesting it's very
 

2555
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:19,070
it's very interesting it's very
different

2556
01:24:19,070 --> 01:24:19,080
different
 

2557
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:22,010
different
so I guess I'll take it but I was first

2558
01:24:22,010 --> 01:24:22,020
so I guess I'll take it but I was first
 

2559
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:25,189
so I guess I'll take it but I was first
not quite sure about it yet and I think

2560
01:24:25,189 --> 01:24:25,199
not quite sure about it yet and I think
 

2561
01:24:25,199 --> 01:24:28,850
not quite sure about it yet and I think
the singing melody was partially also

2562
01:24:28,850 --> 01:24:28,860
the singing melody was partially also
 

2563
01:24:28,860 --> 01:24:32,890
the singing melody was partially also
still very different from what it is now

2564
01:24:32,890 --> 01:24:32,900
still very different from what it is now
 

2565
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:37,430
still very different from what it is now
and money actually ended up creating a

2566
01:24:37,430 --> 01:24:37,440
and money actually ended up creating a
 

2567
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:39,470
and money actually ended up creating a
little bit of a different Melody for

2568
01:24:39,470 --> 01:24:39,480
little bit of a different Melody for
 

2569
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:41,990
little bit of a different Melody for
some parts

2570
01:24:41,990 --> 01:24:42,000
some parts
 

2571
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,770
some parts
um because I thought

2572
01:24:44,770 --> 01:24:44,780
um because I thought
 

2573
01:24:44,780 --> 01:24:48,229
um because I thought
some parts could sound better with a

2574
01:24:48,229 --> 01:24:48,239
some parts could sound better with a
 

2575
01:24:48,239 --> 01:24:49,669
some parts could sound better with a
different singing Melody could flow

2576
01:24:49,669 --> 01:24:49,679
different singing Melody could flow
 

2577
01:24:49,679 --> 01:24:52,370
different singing Melody could flow
better so a lot of changes have been

2578
01:24:52,370 --> 01:24:52,380
better so a lot of changes have been
 

2579
01:24:52,380 --> 01:24:54,530
