303
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,590
now she's showing me her belly um
uh so uh yeah i was thinking because the

304
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:51,600
uh so uh yeah i was thinking because the
 

305
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,949

team starts like approximately two hours

306
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:54,959
team starts like approximately two hours
 

307
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,389
team starts like approximately two hours
after the whole

308
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:56,399
after the whole
 

309
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,829
after the whole
event starts

310
00:09:57,829 --> 00:09:57,839
event starts
 

311
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,310
event starts
so in theory that would mean i could at

312
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:00,320
so in theory that would mean i could at
 

313
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,990
so in theory that would mean i could at
least get maybe one and a half more

314
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:02,000
least get maybe one and a half more
 

315
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,470
least get maybe one and a half more
hours of sleep this starts at a really

316

317
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,470
hours of sleep this starts at a really
bad time for me so every hour counts for

318
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:06,480
bad time for me so every hour counts for
 

319
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,630
bad time for me so every hour counts for
me every every half hour counts for me

320
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:10,640
me every every half hour counts for me
 

321
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,750
me every every half hour counts for me
so and then and then and then we talked

322
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:13,760
