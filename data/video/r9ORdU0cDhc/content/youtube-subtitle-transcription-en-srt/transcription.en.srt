01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:06,830
clear it over the fact
and

3200
01:40:06,830 --> 01:40:06,840
and
 

3201
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:12,250
and
yeah I got like

3202
01:40:12,250 --> 01:40:12,260

 

3203
01:40:12,260 --> 01:40:15,550

that's just funny I didn't get the ideal

3204
01:40:15,550 --> 01:40:15,560
that's just funny I didn't get the ideal
 

3205
01:40:15,560 --> 01:40:17,689
that's just funny I didn't get the ideal
deck I don't know things didn't go so

3206
01:40:17,689 --> 01:40:17,699
deck I don't know things didn't go so
 

3207
01:40:17,699 --> 01:40:23,570
deck I don't know things didn't go so
well so I kind of failed alone

3208
01:40:23,570 --> 01:40:23,580

 

3209
01:40:23,580 --> 01:40:25,850

and didn't work out

3210
01:40:25,850 --> 01:40:25,860
and didn't work out
 

3211
01:40:25,860 --> 01:40:27,950
and didn't work out
um but I tried like two times and since

3212
01:40:27,950 --> 01:40:27,960
um but I tried like two times and since
 

3213
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:29,570
um but I tried like two times and since
that didn't work out I was like okay I

3214
01:40:29,570 --> 01:40:29,580

the poison one

3218
01:40:35,030 --> 01:40:35,040

The Silent One
trying to get a win with that one but

3222
01:40:42,169 --> 01:40:42,179
trying to get a win with that one but
 

3223
01:40:42,179 --> 01:40:44,030
trying to get a win with that one but
then you know I thought oh oh yeah last

3224
01:40:44,030 --> 01:40:44,040
then you know I thought oh oh yeah last
 

3225
01:40:44,040 --> 01:40:45,350
then you know I thought oh oh yeah last
time that went really well because of

3226
01:40:45,350 --> 01:40:45,360
time that went really well because of
 

3227
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:46,550
time that went really well because of
the poison but then I didn't get any

3228
01:40:46,550 --> 01:40:46,560
the poison but then I didn't get any
 

3229
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:47,750
the poison but then I didn't get any
poison cards in the beginning and

3230
01:40:47,750 --> 01:40:47,760
poison cards in the beginning and
 

3231
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:50,390
poison cards in the beginning and
instead got the the shifts cards and I I

3232
01:40:50,390 --> 01:40:50,400
instead got the the shifts cards and I I
 

3233
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:52,310
instead got the the shifts cards and I I
read up on it and I realized that that's

3234
01:40:52,310 --> 01:40:52,320
read up on it and I realized that that's
 

3235
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:53,990
read up on it and I realized that that's
a different build like poison build and

3236
01:40:53,990 --> 01:40:54,000
a different build like poison build and
 

3237
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,209
a different build like poison build and
shift build I'm like okay I guess let's

3238
01:40:56,209 --> 01:40:56,219
shift build I'm like okay I guess let's
 

3239
01:40:56,219 --> 01:40:58,430
shift build I'm like okay I guess let's
learn

3240
01:40:58,430 --> 01:40:58,440
learn
 

3241
01:40:58,440 --> 01:41:01,790
learn
let's learn how to do the shift build so

3242
01:41:01,790 --> 01:41:01,800
let's learn how to do the shift build so
 

3243
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:04,310
let's learn how to do the shift build so
I was looking for sheeps

3244
01:41:04,310 --> 01:41:04,320
I was looking for sheeps
 

3245
01:41:04,320 --> 01:41:07,370
I was looking for sheeps
but then I also didn't get really many

3246
01:41:07,370 --> 01:41:07,380
but then I also didn't get really many
 

3247
01:41:07,380 --> 01:41:10,250
but then I also didn't get really many
shift cards either

3248
01:41:10,250 --> 01:41:10,260
shift cards either
 

3249
01:41:10,260 --> 01:41:12,950
shift cards either
but I was able to manage to make a

3250
01:41:12,950 --> 01:41:12,960
but I was able to manage to make a
 

3251
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:17,510
but I was able to manage to make a
relatively decent build

3252
01:41:17,510 --> 01:41:17,520

 

3253
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:18,470

um but

3254
01:41:18,470 --> 01:41:18,480
um but
 

3255
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:20,689
um but
I had the problem that in the very

3256
01:41:20,689 --> 01:41:20,699
I had the problem that in the very
 

3257
01:41:20,699 --> 01:41:23,450
I had the problem that in the very
beginning

3258
01:41:23,450 --> 01:41:23,460

 

3259
01:41:23,460 --> 01:41:26,390

um you know you get the choice

3260
01:41:26,390 --> 01:41:26,400
um you know you get the choice
 

3261
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:27,709
um you know you get the choice
then like four different choices

3262
01:41:27,709 --> 01:41:27,719
then like four different choices
 

3263
01:41:27,719 --> 01:41:31,850
then like four different choices
sometimes only two

3264

this is too weak to hold on to the
 

4613
02:25:03,420 --> 02:25:12,670
this is too weak to hold on to the
button for that long

4614
02:25:12,670 --> 02:25:12,680

 

4615
02:25:12,680 --> 02:25:16,250

you can jump further than you think well

4618
02:25:17,929 --> 02:25:17,939
you can jump further than you think well
 

4619
02:25:17,939 --> 02:25:19,849
you can jump further than you think well
so far the game has really disappointed

4620
02:25:19,849 --> 02:25:19,859
so far the game has really disappointed
 

4621
02:25:19,859 --> 02:25:23,090
so far the game has really disappointed
me in that regard so

time then we can play the old one
 

8203
04:25:52,020 --> 04:25:54,290

like it's the same title as the new one

8210
04:26:03,469 --> 04:26:03,479
like it's the same title as the new one
 

8211
04:26:03,479 --> 04:26:05,389
like it's the same title as the new one
so I was like a little bit confused but

8212
04:26:05,389 --> 04:26:05,399
so I was like a little bit confused but
 

8213
04:26:05,399 --> 04:26:07,070

there's like a little little title

8214
04:26:07,070 --> 04:26:07,080
there's like a little little title
 

8215
04:26:07,080 --> 04:26:09,410
there's like a little little title
missing like a subtitle so I guess

8216
04:26:09,410 --> 04:26:09,420
missing like a subtitle so I guess
 

8217
04:26:09,420 --> 04:26:11,510
missing like a subtitle so I guess
that's what makes the new one a remake

8218

05:04:46,080 --> 05:04:48,530
there's been issues all day and select
parts of the world but I've been told

9366
05:04:48,530 --> 05:04:48,540
parts of the world but I've been told
 

9367
05:04:48,540 --> 05:04:50,330
parts of the world but I've been told
that it's only my stream but I had

9368
05:04:50,330 --> 05:04:50,340
that it's only my stream but I had
 

9369
05:04:50,340 --> 05:04:52,250
that it's only my stream but I had
problems today too so maybe it's just

9370
05:04:52,250 --> 05:04:52,260
problems today too so maybe it's just
 

9371
05:04:52,260 --> 05:04:55,010
problems today too so maybe it's just
selection streams and selected areas but

9372
05:04:55,010 --> 05:04:55,020
selection streams and selected areas but
 

9373
05:04:55,020 --> 05:04:56,628
selection streams and selected areas but
I wonder if the problem would have been

9374
05:04:56,628 --> 05:04:56,638
I wonder if the problem would have been
 

9375
05:04:56,638 --> 05:04:58,128
I wonder if the problem would have been
solved if I made a new stream I just

9376
05:04:58,128 --> 05:04:58,138
solved if I made a new stream I just
 

9377
05:04:58,138 --> 05:04:59,330
solved if I made a new stream I just
don't normally like to do that because

9378
05:04:59,330 --> 05:04:59,340
don't normally like to do that because
 

9379

9383
05:05:11,120 --> 05:05:13,550

don't [\h__\h] up the jump because then I

9384
05:05:13,550 --> 05:05:13,560
don't [\h__\h] up the jump because then I
 

9385
05:05:13,560 --> 05:05:14,690
don't [\h__\h] up the jump because then I
think I have to do it all over again

9386
05:05:14,690 --> 05:05:14,700
think I have to do it all over again
 

9387
05:05:14,700 --> 05:05:17,288
think I have to do it all over again
maybe

9388
05:05:17,288 --> 05:05:17,298

9677
05:15:10,980 --> 05:15:13,010

always only use four wheels because it

05:15:13,010 --> 05:15:13,020
always only use four wheels because it
 

9679
05:15:13,020 --> 05:15:16,448
always only use four wheels because it
makes everything so much easier

9697
05:15:42,240 --> 05:15:43,430

11478
06:09:19,070 --> 06:09:19,080
should be okay and then another idea was
 

11479
06:09:19,080 --> 06:09:21,230
should be okay and then another idea was
like maybe

11480
06:09:21,230 --> 06:09:21,240
like maybe
 

11481
06:09:21,240 --> 06:09:23,628
like maybe
um think you know coming up with a new

11482
06:09:23,628 --> 06:09:23,638
um think you know coming up with a new
