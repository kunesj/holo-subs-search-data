and further away from the screen
 

1591
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:20,589
and further away from the screen
right stuff like that happens and also

like when you jump uh you could suddenly
 

1595
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,430
like when you jump uh you could suddenly
within one jump just zoom out of the

1596
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:27,440
within one jump just zoom out of the
 

1597
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,589
within one jump just zoom out of the
screen or it will just not really like

1598
00:41:29,589 --> 00:41:29,599
screen or it will just not really like
 

1599
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:32,150
screen or it will just not really like
see it will not really accurately show

1600
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:32,160
see it will not really accurately show
 

1601
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,270
see it will not really accurately show
your jump like you it won't really look

1602
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:34,280
your jump like you it won't really look
 

1603
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,750
your jump like you it won't really look
like you lifted your legs at all stuff

like that is like really
[\h__\h] um the rest isn't even so bad oh

1608
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:45,200
[\h__\h] um the rest isn't even so bad oh
 

1609
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,630
[\h__\h] um the rest isn't even so bad oh
but yeah I also what I what I would have

1610

as big as it it's supposed to look like

1618
00:41:59,870 --> 00:41:59,880
as big as it it's supposed to look like
 

1619
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:04,309
as big as it it's supposed to look like
in reality at all um so now I thought

1620
00:42:04,309 --> 00:42:04,319
in reality at all um so now I thought
 

1621
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:05,790
in reality at all um so now I thought
with this one it will be better the

1622
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:05,800
with this one it will be better the
 

1623
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,950
with this one it will be better the
jumping I can say yes the moving away is

1624
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:08,960
jumping I can say yes the moving away is
 

1625
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,630
jumping I can say yes the moving away is
not happening and and the jumping like

1626
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:11,640
not happening and and the jumping like
 

1627
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,430
not happening and and the jumping like
you can really see the the body lift off

1628
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:14,440
you can really see the the body lift off
 

1629
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,190
you can really see the the body lift off
of the ground and all that so that's

1630
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:16,200
of the ground and all that so that's
 

1631
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,190
of the ground and all that so that's
like really accurate um so no issues so

1632
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:19,200
like really accurate um so no issues so
 

1633
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,150
like really accurate um so no issues so
far it's really smooth there's like

1634
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:22,160
far it's really smooth there's like
 

1635

1639
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:28,829
maybe have had some chunkiness but it
was only probably because of the first

1640
00:42:28,829 --> 00:42:28,839
was only probably because of the first
 

1641
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:30,270
was only probably because of the first
time there can still be made some

1642
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:30,280
time there can still be made some
 

1643
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,230
time there can still be made some
improvements probably I can figure it

1644
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:32,240
improvements probably I can figure it
 

1645
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,309
improvements probably I can figure it
out probably hopefully I better because

1646
00:42:34,309 --> 00:42:34,319
out probably hopefully I better because
 

1647
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:37,790
out probably hopefully I better because

that's like normal with these types of
 

1695
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:46,790
that's like normal with these types of
uh motion capture methods that because

uh motion capture methods that because
 

1697
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,069
uh motion capture methods that because
those are those are like trackers and

put on a suit and trackers but they're
 

1715
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:10,829
put on a suit and trackers but they're
different

1716
00:44:10,829 --> 00:44:10,839
different
 

1717
00:44:10,839 --> 00:44:13,589

more accurate it is uh and this is

1722
00:44:17,829 --> 00:44:17,839
more accurate it is uh and this is
 

1723
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:20,030
more accurate it is uh and this is
generally more reliable but more

1724
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:20,040
generally more reliable but more
 

1725
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,589

version of that kind of
 

1731
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:32,030
version of that kind of
tracking like as expensive as it can and

1732
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:32,040
tracking like as expensive as it can and
 

1733
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,109
tracking like as expensive as it can and
I mean within X since there's still more

1734
00:44:34,109 --> 00:44:34,119
I mean within X since there's still more
 

1735
00:44:34,119 --> 00:44:36,190
I mean within X since there's still more
expensive options a little bit a little

1736
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:36,200
expensive options a little bit a little
 

1737
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:39,470
expensive options a little bit a little
bit more expensive um but yeah like

bit more expensive um but yeah like
 

1739
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,630
bit more expensive um but yeah like
compared to M and so on which is like in

1740
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:41,640
compared to M and so on which is like in
 

1741
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,829
compared to M and so on which is like in
the same category basically what I have

the same category basically what I have
 

1743
00:44:44,839 --> 00:44:46,990
the same category basically what I have
now is like the as expensive as it gets

1744
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:47,000
now is like the as expensive as it gets

00:46:05,309 --> 00:46:05,319
shows such movements I'm giving it
 

1797
00:46:05,319 --> 00:46:07,870
shows such movements I'm giving it
back but yeah my next step is trying to

1798
00:46:07,870 --> 00:46:07,880
back but yeah my next step is trying to
 

1799
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:10,549
back but yeah my next step is trying to
figure out how the streaming works it's

1800
00:46:10,549 --> 00:46:10,559
figure out how the streaming works it's
 

1801
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:12,069
figure out how the streaming works it's
kind of difficult to figure it out

1802
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:12,079
kind of difficult to figure it out
 

1803
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:13,870
kind of difficult to figure it out
because there's no one else who tried

1804
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:13,880
because there's no one else who tried
 

1805
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,670
because there's no one else who tried
accents with our whole life application

1806
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:16,680
accents with our whole life application
 

1807
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:20,109
accents with our whole life application
before uh like connecting the accents

1808
00:46:20,109 --> 00:46:20,119
before uh like connecting the accents
 

1809
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:23,069
before uh like connecting the accents
program to our application I tried it

1810
00:46:23,069 --> 00:46:23,079
program to our application I tried it
 

1811
00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:25,630
program to our application I tried it
last night and I just I don't know I

1812
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:25,640
last night and I just I don't know I
 

1813
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:28,270
last night and I just I don't know I
just couldn't find how to do it even

1814
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:28,280
just couldn't find how to do it even
 

1815
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,030
just couldn't find how to do it even
though it should be similar to how they

1816
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:30,040
though it should be similar to how they
 

1817
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:32,790
though it should be similar to how they
connect other things but I just couldn't

1818
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:32,800
connect other things but I just couldn't
 

1819
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,230
connect other things but I just couldn't
find it and I was trying I was trying I

1820
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:35,240
find it and I was trying I was trying I
 

1821
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,950
find it and I was trying I was trying I
got the other things to work that seemed

1822
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:36,960
got the other things to work that seemed
 

1823
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,950
got the other things to work that seemed
pretty difficult to me and I

1824
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:39,960
pretty difficult to me and I
 

1825
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:43,589
pretty difficult to me and I
oh I could show I could show

1826
00:46:43,589 --> 00:46:43,599
oh I could show I could show
 

1827
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:45,870
oh I could show I could show
you

1828
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:45,880
you
 

1829
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:48,510
you
uh yes so

1830
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:48,520
uh yes so
 

1831
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,829
uh yes so
yesterday uh the little data that I

1832
00:46:50,829 --> 00:46:50,839
yesterday uh the little data that I
 

1833
00:46:50,839 --> 00:46:52,430
yesterday uh the little data that I
recorded I didn't know what to do with

1834
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:52,440
recorded I didn't know what to do with
 

1835
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,270
recorded I didn't know what to do with
it because in the end it's just like

1836
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:54,280
it because in the end it's just like
 

1837
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:58,230
it because in the end it's just like
like weird um body data without a body

1838
00:46:58,230 --> 00:46:58,240
like weird um body data without a body
 

1839
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:02,230
like weird um body data without a body
and I I sent it uh to chagy because I

1840
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:02,240
and I I sent it uh to chagy because I
 

1841
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,870
and I I sent it uh to chagy because I
thought maybe chagy can figure out how

1842
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:03,880
thought maybe chagy can figure out how
 

1843
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:08,549
thought maybe chagy can figure out how
to use this and hell yeah he can thank

1844
00:47:08,549 --> 00:47:08,559
to use this and hell yeah he can thank
 

1845
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:14,150
to use this and hell yeah he can thank
god um so maybe I'll

1846
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:14,160
god um so maybe I'll
 

1847
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:18,109

test without finger

1850
00:47:20,829 --> 00:47:20,839
test without finger
 

1851
00:47:20,839 --> 00:47:24,630

tracking and with without I mean there

1852
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:24,640
tracking and with without I mean there
 

1853
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,670
tracking and with without I mean there
there's still maybe some there's room

1854
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:26,680
there's still maybe some there's room
 

1855
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,910
there's still maybe some there's room
for improvement and there's no finger

1856
00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:28,920
for improvement and there's no finger
 

1857
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:32,150
for improvement and there's no finger
tracking yet do you want to see it just

1858
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:32,160
tracking yet do you want to see it just
 

1859
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,910

tries to figure

1866
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:41,920
tries to figure
 

1867
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,950
tries to figure
out uh how to get

1868
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:44,960
out uh how to get
 

1869
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:50,109
out uh how to get
decent uh very basic but but still

1870
00:47:50,109 --> 00:47:50,119
decent uh very basic but but still
 

1871
00:47:50,119 --> 00:47:52,510
decent uh very basic but but still
hopefully high quality motion capture

1872
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:52,520
hopefully high quality motion capture
 

1873
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:53,490
hopefully high quality motion capture

that's like for me that's that's amazing

1956
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:02,880
that's like for me that's that's amazing
 

1957
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,109
that's like for me that's that's amazing
so there's potential I I would

1958
00:50:06,109 --> 00:50:06,119
so there's potential I I would
 

1959
00:50:06,119 --> 00:50:09,470
so there's potential I I would
say whole torso is like a box yeah get

1960
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:09,480
say whole torso is like a box yeah get
 

1961
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:12,510
say whole torso is like a box yeah get
more trackers that's not really I don't

1962
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:12,520
more trackers that's not really I don't
 

1963
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:15,069
more trackers that's not really I don't
know if that's possible um the thing is

1964
00:50:15,069 --> 00:50:15,079
know if that's possible um the thing is
 

1965
00:50:15,079 --> 00:50:16,750
know if that's possible um the thing is
how many trackers did I have on I had

1966
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:16,760
how many trackers did I have on I had
 

1967
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:20,109
how many trackers did I have on I had
two on my on my back

1968
00:50:20,109 --> 00:50:20,119

 

1969
00:50:20,119 --> 00:50:22,390

shoulders oh yeah there's and there's

1970
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:22,400
shoulders oh yeah there's and there's
 

1971
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,910
shoulders oh yeah there's and there's
one on the neck like on the on the

1972
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:24,920
one on the neck like on the on the
 

1973
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:28,630
one on the neck like on the on the
collar

1974
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:28,640

 

1975
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:31,950

pH yeah that's like pretty much it and

1976
00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:31,960
pH yeah that's like pretty much it and
 

1977
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:35,190
pH yeah that's like pretty much it and
then one on the on the hip on the back

1978
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:35,200
then one on the on the hip on the back
 

1979
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,589
then one on the on the hip on the back
of the hip on the center of the back of

1980
00:50:38,589 --> 00:50:38,599
of the hip on the center of the back of
 

1981
00:50:38,599 --> 00:50:41,710
of the hip on the center of the back of
the hip I think that was it that is like

1982
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:41,720
the hip I think that was it that is like
 

1983
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:46,150
the hip I think that was it that is like
really barely anything

1984
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:46,160

 

1985
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:49,150

yeah I'll ask them if there's any any

1986
00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:49,160
yeah I'll ask them if there's any any
 

1987
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:53,069
yeah I'll ask them if there's any any
way I can improve if they can send me

1988
00:50:53,069 --> 00:50:53,079
way I can improve if they can send me
 

1989
00:50:53,079 --> 00:50:55,510
way I can improve if they can send me
another tracker or so oh actually I

1990
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:55,520
another tracker or so oh actually I
 

1991
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,510
another tracker or so oh actually I
think I had two trackers left over did I

1992
00:50:57,510 --> 00:50:57,520
think I had two trackers left over did I
 

1993
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,630
think I had two trackers left over did I
no nah no I didn't no I didn't no

1994
00:50:59,630 --> 00:50:59,640
no nah no I didn't no I didn't no
 

1995
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,510
no nah no I didn't no I didn't no
trackers just the straps were left over

1996
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:02,520
trackers just the straps were left over
 

1997
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,390
trackers just the straps were left over
but yeah that really leaves something to

1998
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:04,400
but yeah that really leaves something to
 

1999
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,990
but yeah that really leaves something to
be desired but I need to try to like

2000
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:06,000
be desired but I need to try to like
 

2001
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,910
be desired but I need to try to like
dance a little bit with it and see how

2002
00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:07,920
dance a little bit with it and see how
 

2003
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:11,069
dance a little bit with it and see how
it looks if I dance something

2004
00:51:11,069 --> 00:51:11,079
it looks if I dance something
 

2005
00:51:11,079 --> 00:51:14,230
it looks if I dance something
proper it'll be fine for a music video I

2006
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:14,240
proper it'll be fine for a music video I
 

2007
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:17,950
proper it'll be fine for a music video I
I think I

2008
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:17,960

 

2009
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:20,150

think I wonder how much they'll charge

2010
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:20,160
think I wonder how much they'll charge
 

2011
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,069
think I wonder how much they'll charge
if I ask for one more

2012
00:51:22,069 --> 00:51:22,079
if I ask for one more
 

2013
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,829
if I ask for one more
tracker Honestly though the the the the

2014
00:51:24,829 --> 00:51:24,839
tracker Honestly though the the the the
 

2015
00:51:24,839 --> 00:51:27,630
tracker Honestly though the the the the
gloves make up half of the price

2016
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:27,640
gloves make up half of the price
 

2017
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:29,910
gloves make up half of the price
so

2018
00:51:29,910 --> 00:51:29,920
so
 

2019
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,030
so
it's probably one more tracker won't

2020
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:32,040
it's probably one more tracker won't
 

2021
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:34,750
it's probably one more tracker won't
even be so

2022
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:34,760

calibrated like several times and then

00:52:11,109 --> 00:52:11,119
calibrated like several times and then
 

2051
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:13,230
calibrated like several times and then
um most of the time it was like really

2052
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:13,240
um most of the time it was like really
 

2053
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:15,309
um most of the time it was like really
iffy and it says that the calibration

2054
00:52:15,309 --> 00:52:15,319
iffy and it says that the calibration
 

2055
00:52:15,319 --> 00:52:18,789
iffy and it says that the calibration
process was poor did not go so well it

2056
00:52:18,789 --> 00:52:18,799
process was poor did not go so well it
 

2057
00:52:18,799 --> 00:52:22,150

d decent calibration and said this one

00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:27,160
d decent calibration and said this one
 

2063
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:30,630
d decent calibration and said this one
was okay decent and that's what came out

2064
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:30,640
was okay decent and that's what came out
 

2065

130 Polaroids so if you still were

2092
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:08,480
130 Polaroids so if you still were
 

2093
