3787
02:12:05,460 --> 02:12:08,089

soccer before as long as the goalkeeper

3788
02:12:08,089 --> 02:12:08,099
soccer before as long as the goalkeeper
 

3789
02:12:08,099 --> 02:12:09,770
soccer before as long as the goalkeeper
doesn't stop you know yeah I think the

3790
02:12:09,770 --> 02:12:09,780
doesn't stop you know yeah I think the
 

3791
02:12:09,780 --> 02:12:12,589
doesn't stop you know yeah I think the
goalkeeper gonna it's easier for the

3792
02:12:12,589 --> 02:12:12,599
goalkeeper gonna it's easier for the
 

3793
02:12:12,599 --> 02:12:14,390
goalkeeper gonna it's easier for the
goalkeeper to hold

3794
02:12:14,390 --> 02:12:14,400
goalkeeper to hold
 

3795
02:12:14,400 --> 02:12:18,109
goalkeeper to hold
rather we dribble the ball like I think

3796
02:12:18,109 --> 02:12:18,119
rather we dribble the ball like I think
 

3797
02:12:18,119 --> 02:12:20,510

pretty much I think this is going to be
 

4249
02:25:01,680 --> 02:25:03,770
pretty much I think this is going to be
like five minutes match and okay you can

4250
02:25:03,770 --> 02:25:03,780
like five minutes match and okay you can
 

4251

worry I have this problem this uh starts
for me at 6 00 a.m and the Pokemon

4340
02:27:31,610 --> 02:27:31,620
for me at 6 00 a.m and the Pokemon
 

4341
02:27:31,620 --> 02:27:34,389
for me at 6 00 a.m and the Pokemon
tournament I had to be there at 4 00 am

4342
02:27:34,389 --> 02:27:34,399
tournament I had to be there at 4 00 am
 

4343
02:27:34,399 --> 02:27:39,889
tournament I had to be there at 4 00 am
so yeah it's it's I don't know if I

4344
02:27:39,889 --> 02:27:39,899
so yeah it's it's I don't know if I
 

4345
02:27:39,899 --> 02:27:42,650
so yeah it's it's I don't know if I
should stay up or go to sleep super

4346
02:27:42,650 --> 02:27:42,660
should stay up or go to sleep super
 

4347
02:27:42,660 --> 02:27:45,490
should stay up or go to sleep super
early or go to sleep

4348
02:27:45,490 --> 02:27:45,500
early or go to sleep
 

4349
02:27:45,500 --> 02:27:49,670
early or go to sleep
I can't do that normally though

4350
02:27:49,670 --> 02:27:49,680
I can't do that normally though
 

4351
02:27:49,680 --> 02:27:53,750
I can't do that normally though
yeah also I have I have hold a talk at

4352
02:27:53,750 --> 02:27:53,760
yeah also I have I have hold a talk at
 

4353
02:27:53,760 --> 02:27:57,469
yeah also I have I have hold a talk at
10 pm so that's like I think whole talk

4354
02:27:57,469 --> 02:27:57,479
10 pm so that's like I think whole talk
 

4355
02:27:57,479 --> 02:27:59,330
10 pm so that's like I think whole talk
would end at midnight that's six hours

4356
02:27:59,330 --> 02:27:59,340
would end at midnight that's six hours
 

4357
02:27:59,340 --> 02:28:01,790
would end at midnight that's six hours
before the Minecraft thing I would be

4358
02:28:01,790 --> 02:28:01,800
before the Minecraft thing I would be
 

4359
02:28:01,800 --> 02:28:04,190
before the Minecraft thing I would be
done with holotalk six hours

4360
02:28:04,190 --> 02:28:04,200
done with holotalk six hours
 

4361
02:28:04,200 --> 02:28:06,230
done with holotalk six hours
so that's not really enough time for me

4362
02:28:06,230 --> 02:28:06,240
so that's not really enough time for me
 

4363
02:28:06,240 --> 02:28:08,389
so that's not really enough time for me
to sleep because I need one hour at

4364
02:28:08,389 --> 02:28:08,399
to sleep because I need one hour at
 

4365
02:28:08,399 --> 02:28:11,090
to sleep because I need one hour at
least to fall asleep but realistically

02:55:30,830 --> 02:55:30,840
well that might be a little bit
 

5567
02:55:30,840 --> 02:55:33,769
well that might be a little bit
difficult because then where we have so

5568
02:55:33,769 --> 02:55:33,779
difficult because then where we have so
 

5569
02:55:33,779 --> 02:55:36,010
difficult because then where we have so
many different time zones

many different time zones
 

5571
02:55:36,020 --> 02:55:42,469
