time you can you can build up basically

352
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:42,399
time you can you can build up basically
 

353
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,470
time you can you can build up basically
one block what happens is that there's

354
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:44,480
one block what happens is that there's
 

355
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,350
one block what happens is that there's
different biomes and and different

basically different levels you if every
 

359
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,230
basically different levels you if every
time you you know mine the block you get

360
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:52,240
time you you know mine the block you get
 

361
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,910
time you you know mine the block you get
closer to the next level which is like

yeah I was going to say maybe we should

720
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:07,799
yeah I was going to say maybe we should
 

721
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:10,470
yeah I was going to say maybe we should
make a farm and then if we start farming

722
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:10,480
make a farm and then if we start farming
 

723
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,310
make a farm and then if we start farming
we can feed them and then you know

724
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:13,320
we can feed them and then you know
 

725
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,430
we can feed them and then you know
multiple yes yes yes we have seeds too

726
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:16,440
multiple yes yes yes we have seeds too
 

727
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,430
multiple yes yes yes we have seeds too
so I'll put the seeds in the bottom row

728
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:18,440
so I'll put the seeds in the bottom row
 

729
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:22,830
so I'll put the seeds in the bottom row
so we can grow watermelon yeah how

730
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:22,840
so we can grow watermelon yeah how
 

731
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,310
so we can grow watermelon yeah how
water maybe water will also be a

732

we
regular biome right the grassland biome

8074
03:21:49,389 --> 03:21:49,399
regular biome right the grassland biome
 

8075
03:21:49,399 --> 03:21:51,870
regular biome right the grassland biome
it's it's it's not random to get biomes

8076
03:21:51,870 --> 03:21:51,880
it's it's it's not random to get biomes
 

8077
03:21:51,880 --> 03:21:53,950
it's it's it's not random to get biomes
it's like in order specific order so

8078
03:21:53,950 --> 03:21:53,960
it's like in order specific order so
 

8079
03:21:53,960 --> 03:21:57,030
it's like in order specific order so
we're not getting anywhere blocks but

8080
03:21:57,030 --> 03:21:57,040
we're not getting anywhere blocks but
 

8081
03:21:57,040 --> 03:21:58,790
we're not getting anywhere blocks but
that's why that's why I was wondering if

8082
03:21:58,790 --> 03:21:58,800
that's why that's why I was wondering if
 

8083
03:21:58,800 --> 03:22:01,070
that's why that's why I was wondering if
it circles and rotates back and we get

8084
03:22:01,070 --> 03:22:01,080
it circles and rotates back and we get
 

8085
03:22:01,080 --> 03:22:03,910
it circles and rotates back and we get
the normal biomi again at some

8086
03:22:03,910 --> 03:22:03,920
the normal biomi again at some
 

8087
03:22:03,920 --> 03:22:07,070
the normal biomi again at some
point biom me Chad says the dogs killed

grass dirt blocks then

8106
03:22:28,910 --> 03:22:28,920
grass dirt blocks then
 

8107
03:22:28,920 --> 03:22:32,150
grass dirt blocks then
too I think touch that's what it's

8108
03:22:32,150 --> 03:22:32,160
too I think touch that's what it's
 

8109
03:22:32,160 --> 03:22:33,790
too I think touch that's what it's
called yeah we would have needed silk

8110
03:22:33,790 --> 03:22:33,800
called yeah we would have needed silk
 

8111
03:22:33,800 --> 03:22:36,189
called yeah we would have needed silk
touch to get the grass blocks unless we

8112
03:22:36,189 --> 03:22:36,199
touch to get the grass blocks unless we
 

8113
03:22:36,199 --> 03:22:37,910
touch to get the grass blocks unless we
do something Fancy with the dirt blocks

8114
03:22:37,910 --> 03:22:37,920
do something Fancy with the dirt blocks
 

8115
03:22:37,920 --> 03:22:40,030
do something Fancy with the dirt blocks
around the one block but then

8116
03:22:40,030 --> 03:22:40,040
around the one block but then
 

8117
03:22:40,040 --> 03:22:43,429
around the one block but then
it's okay takes while like yeah we put

8118
03:22:43,429 --> 03:22:43,439
it's okay takes while like yeah we put
 

8119
03:22:43,439 --> 03:22:46,110
it's okay takes while like yeah we put
dirt and then get surround it with dirt

8120
03:22:46,110 --> 03:22:46,120
dirt and then get surround it with dirt
 

8121
03:22:46,120 --> 03:22:48,030
dirt and then get surround it with dirt
and then see if there's a grass block if

8122
03:22:48,030 --> 03:22:48,040
and then see if there's a grass block if
 

8123
03:22:48,040 --> 03:22:50,389
and then see if there's a grass block if
it ever comes back and let it spread

8124
03:22:50,389 --> 03:22:50,399
it ever comes back and let it spread
 

8125
03:22:50,399 --> 03:22:52,670
it ever comes back and let it spread
I'll think of some missions like that

8126
03:22:52,670 --> 03:22:52,680
I'll think of some missions like that
 

8127
03:22:52,680 --> 03:22:55,349
I'll think of some missions like that
like uh like create a grass block
