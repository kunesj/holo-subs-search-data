903
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,210
mean I guess it's an iceberg for the
turtle because it's very big only in the

904
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:26,220
turtle because it's very big only in the
 

905
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,130
turtle because it's very big only in the
eyes of the turtle

906
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:28,140
eyes of the turtle
 

907
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,930

911
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,649

actually before we try the turtle again

912
00:29:33,649 --> 00:29:33,659
actually before we try the turtle again
 

913
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:35,630
actually before we try the turtle again
let's try to

914
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:35,640
let's try to
 

915
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,169
let's try to
the baby catching if that is even a

916
00:29:39,169 --> 00:29:39,179
the baby catching if that is even a
 

917
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:43,490
the baby catching if that is even a
possibility I do not know

918
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:43,500

 

919
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:47,389

but do I have to stand exactly on like
the exact pixel

922
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:49,799
the exact pixel
 

923
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:56,470
the exact pixel
of where I think it will land I hope not

924
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:56,480

 

925
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,720

934
00:30:09,169 --> 00:30:09,179
how are you I I'm not so worried about
 

935
00:30:09,179 --> 00:30:11,149
how are you I I'm not so worried about

with or without me it doesn't matter

940
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:17,100
with or without me it doesn't matter
 

941
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,310
with or without me it doesn't matter
so

942
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:19,320
so
 

943
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,250
so
maybe maybe we should let the turtle

944
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:22,260
maybe maybe we should let the turtle
 

945
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,990
maybe maybe we should let the turtle
just be
