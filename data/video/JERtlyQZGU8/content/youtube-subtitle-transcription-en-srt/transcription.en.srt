4968
02:08:54,530 --> 02:08:54,540
and I didn't have priority I guess I
 

4969
02:08:54,540 --> 02:08:55,910
and I didn't have priority I guess I
could have booked it additionally but I

4970
02:08:55,910 --> 02:08:55,920
could have booked it additionally but I
 

4971
02:08:55,920 --> 02:08:57,770
could have booked it additionally but I
didn't need it I was like whatever I'll

4972
02:08:57,770 --> 02:08:57,780
didn't need it I was like whatever I'll
 

4973
02:08:57,780 --> 02:09:00,050
didn't need it I was like whatever I'll
need it

4974
02:09:00,050 --> 02:09:00,060
need it
 

4975
02:09:00,060 --> 02:09:02,030
need it
so they had priority

4976
02:09:02,030 --> 02:09:02,040
so they had priority
 

4977
02:09:02,040 --> 02:09:05,149
so they had priority
but hey

4978
02:09:05,149 --> 02:09:05,159
but hey
 

4979
02:09:05,159 --> 02:09:09,490
but hey

person who lines up really fast
um yeah I'm one of those [\h__\h]

5006
02:09:43,370 --> 02:09:43,380
um yeah I'm one of those [\h__\h]
 

5007

uh but

5008
02:09:45,589 --> 02:09:45,599
uh but
 

5009
02:09:45,599 --> 02:09:48,229
uh but
yeah this time I was like I don't care I

don't care everybody gets in the plane

5012
02:09:49,729 --> 02:09:49,739
don't care everybody gets in the plane
 

5013
02:09:49,739 --> 02:09:53,750
don't care everybody gets in the plane
eventually so [\h__\h] it no need to stress

5014
02:09:53,750 --> 02:09:53,760
eventually so [\h__\h] it no need to stress
 

5015
02:09:53,760 --> 02:09:55,189
eventually so [\h__\h] it no need to stress
myself out

5016
02:09:55,189 --> 02:09:55,199
myself out
 

5017
02:09:55,199 --> 02:09:58,910
myself out
and then after like 20 minutes or so

5018
02:09:58,910 --> 02:09:58,920
and then after like 20 minutes or so
 

5019
02:09:58,920 --> 02:10:00,589
and then after like 20 minutes or so
I finally

5020
02:10:00,589 --> 02:10:00,599
I finally
 

5021
02:10:00,599 --> 02:10:02,990
I finally
make my way

5022
02:10:02,990 --> 02:10:03,000
make my way
 

5023
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,629
make my way
like I line up and try to get into the

5024
02:10:05,629 --> 02:10:05,639
like I line up and try to get into the
 

5025
02:10:05,639 --> 02:10:06,709
like I line up and try to get into the
plane

5026
02:10:06,709 --> 02:10:06,719
plane
 

5027
02:10:06,719 --> 02:10:08,510
plane
and so the thing is like they they

5028
02:10:08,510 --> 02:10:08,520
and so the thing is like they they
 

5029
02:10:08,520 --> 02:10:10,310
and so the thing is like they they
bought they were gonna board like from

5030
02:10:10,310 --> 02:10:10,320
bought they were gonna board like from
 

5031
02:10:10,320 --> 02:10:11,930
bought they were gonna board like from
the front of the plane and I was gonna

5032
02:10:11,930 --> 02:10:11,940
the front of the plane and I was gonna
 

5033
02:10:11,940 --> 02:10:14,149
the front of the plane and I was gonna
board from the back

5034
02:10:14,149 --> 02:10:14,159
board from the back
 

5035
02:10:14,159 --> 02:10:18,189
board from the back
and then

5036
02:10:18,189 --> 02:10:18,199

 

5037
02:10:18,199 --> 02:10:21,470

I answered the plane

5038
02:10:21,470 --> 02:10:21,480
I answered the plane
 

5039
02:10:21,480 --> 02:10:24,649
I answered the plane
so much later than them but I got to my

5040
02:10:24,649 --> 02:10:24,659
so much later than them but I got to my
 

5041
02:10:24,659 --> 02:10:26,629
so much later than them but I got to my
seat

5042
02:10:26,629 --> 02:10:26,639
seat
 

5043
02:10:26,639 --> 02:10:28,370
seat
earlier than them

5044
02:10:28,370 --> 02:10:28,380
earlier than them
 

5045
02:10:28,380 --> 02:10:31,669
earlier than them
and I find that very ironic because I

5046
02:10:31,669 --> 02:10:31,679
and I find that very ironic because I
 

5047
02:10:31,679 --> 02:10:34,490
and I find that very ironic because I
did not have priority

5048
02:10:34,490 --> 02:10:34,500
did not have priority
 

5049
02:10:34,500 --> 02:10:39,169
did not have priority
and in the end

5050
02:10:39,169 --> 02:10:39,179

 

5051
02:10:39,179 --> 02:10:41,390

of them and I even gave them a head

5052
02:10:41,390 --> 02:10:41,400
of them and I even gave them a head
 

5053
02:10:41,400 --> 02:10:42,530
of them and I even gave them a head
start

5054
02:10:42,530 --> 02:10:42,540
start
 

5055
02:10:42,540 --> 02:10:44,810
start
yeah it's because like they all like

5056
02:10:44,810 --> 02:10:44,820
yeah it's because like they all like
 

5057
02:10:44,820 --> 02:10:47,569
yeah it's because like they all like
like even after you know you go through

5058
02:10:47,569 --> 02:10:47,579
like even after you know you go through
 

5059
02:10:47,579 --> 02:10:49,850
like even after you know you go through
you you show your ticket one last time

5060
02:10:49,850 --> 02:10:49,860
you you show your ticket one last time
 

5061
02:10:49,860 --> 02:10:51,890
you you show your ticket one last time
and then you go through this kind of

5062
02:10:51,890 --> 02:10:51,900
and then you go through this kind of
 

5063
02:10:51,900 --> 02:10:55,189
and then you go through this kind of
tube thingy but then you know it gets

5064
02:10:55,189 --> 02:10:55,199
tube thingy but then you know it gets
 

5065
02:10:55,199 --> 02:10:57,649
tube thingy but then you know it gets
crowded and people take time to

5066
02:10:57,649 --> 02:10:57,659
crowded and people take time to
 

5067
02:10:57,659 --> 02:10:59,750
crowded and people take time to
like sometimes they let you in before

5068
02:10:59,750 --> 02:10:59,760
like sometimes they let you in before
 

5069
02:10:59,760 --> 02:11:02,510
like sometimes they let you in before
they even actually let people in so they

5070
02:11:02,510 --> 02:11:02,520
they even actually let people in so they
 

5071
02:11:02,520 --> 02:11:04,970
they even actually let people in so they
just like let people into into the tube

5072
02:11:04,970 --> 02:11:04,980
just like let people into into the tube
 

5073
02:11:04,980 --> 02:11:06,890
just like let people into into the tube
first but then still make you waiting

5074
02:11:06,890 --> 02:11:06,900
first but then still make you waiting
 

5075
02:11:06,900 --> 02:11:08,569
first but then still make you waiting
right in front of the door of the plane

5076
02:11:08,569 --> 02:11:08,579
right in front of the door of the plane
 

5077
02:11:08,579 --> 02:11:10,490
right in front of the door of the plane
I guess that that maybe that was what

5078
02:11:10,490 --> 02:11:10,500
I guess that that maybe that was what
 

5079
02:11:10,500 --> 02:11:12,830
I guess that that maybe that was what
happened first and that's why there like

5080
02:11:12,830 --> 02:11:12,840
happened first and that's why there like
 

5081
02:11:12,840 --> 02:11:15,709
happened first and that's why there like
a line was built inside the tube

5082
02:11:15,709 --> 02:11:15,719
a line was built inside the tube
 

5083
02:11:15,719 --> 02:11:18,109
a line was built inside the tube
and they had to just stand and wait a

5084
02:11:18,109 --> 02:11:18,119
and they had to just stand and wait a
 

5085
02:11:18,119 --> 02:11:20,930
and they had to just stand and wait a
bit more but I waited and waited and

5086
02:11:20,930 --> 02:11:20,940
bit more but I waited and waited and
 

5087
02:11:20,940 --> 02:11:24,050
bit more but I waited and waited and
waited and waited and I had to board by

5088
02:11:24,050 --> 02:11:24,060
waited and waited and I had to board by
 

5089
02:11:24,060 --> 02:11:25,129
waited and waited and I had to board by
going

5090
02:11:25,129 --> 02:11:25,139

5091
02:11:25,139 --> 02:11:28,310

5095
02:11:29,760 --> 02:11:31,370

the tube but I went on the ground into

5096
02:11:31,370 --> 02:11:31,380
the tube but I went on the ground into
 

5097
02:11:31,380 --> 02:11:32,750
the tube but I went on the ground into
the back of the plane and then I went up

5098
02:11:32,750 --> 02:11:32,760
the back of the plane and then I went up
 

5099
02:11:32,760 --> 02:11:34,069
the back of the plane and then I went up
the stairs and I was in the plane and

5100
02:11:34,069 --> 02:11:34,079
the stairs and I was in the plane and
 

5101
02:11:34,079 --> 02:11:36,729

obvious
the whole if you compare the

9120
03:56:38,689 --> 03:56:38,699

the whole if you compare the
um and the where my body is facing for

the first Sparks it was constantly
facing a little bit sideless and then in

before the end of August somewhere

9184
03:58:09,410 --> 03:58:09,420
before the end of August somewhere
 

9185
03:58:09,420 --> 03:58:11,030
before the end of August somewhere
around the middle should be possible

around the middle should be possible
yeah I'm so excited because

03:58:15,410 --> 03:58:15,420

 

9189
03:58:15,420 --> 03:58:18,229

it's

03:58:18,239 --> 03:58:21,170

you know there's differences in tastes

9192
03:58:21,170 --> 03:58:21,180
you know there's differences in tastes
 

9193
03:58:21,180 --> 03:58:22,610
you know there's differences in tastes
of music

9194
03:58:22,610 --> 03:58:22,620
of music
 

9195
03:58:22,620 --> 03:58:24,769
of music
but

9196
03:58:24,769 --> 03:58:24,779
but
 

9197
03:58:24,779 --> 03:58:26,870
but
personally I think it's my biggest

9198
03:58:26,870 --> 03:58:26,880
personally I think it's my biggest
 

9199
03:58:26,880 --> 03:58:29,510
personally I think it's my biggest
banger but that's just my own Taste of

9200
03:58:29,510 --> 03:58:29,520
banger but that's just my own Taste of
 

9201
03:58:29,520 --> 03:58:32,210
banger but that's just my own Taste of
music maybe I don't know about you guys

9202
03:58:32,210 --> 03:58:32,220

but
 

9205
03:58:33,359 --> 03:58:36,170
but
I think even if if that's not the genre

9206
03:58:36,170 --> 03:58:36,180
I think even if if that's not the genre
 

9207
03:58:36,180 --> 03:58:38,030
I think even if if that's not the genre
that you normally like to listen to I

12201
05:20:59,280 --> 05:21:02,770
I feel like what what could have been
improved uh is some of the same points

12202
05:21:02,770 --> 05:21:02,780
improved uh is some of the same points
 

12203
05:21:02,780 --> 05:21:06,350
improved uh is some of the same points
and I think well I thought the graphics

12204
05:21:06,350 --> 05:21:06,360
and I think well I thought the graphics
 

12205
05:21:06,360 --> 05:21:08,690
and I think well I thought the graphics
overall were really nice I thought you

12206

05:21:09,708 --> 05:21:09,718
know
 

12209
05:21:09,718 --> 05:21:12,350
know
what should be the focus the cat could

12210
05:21:12,350 --> 05:21:12,360
what should be the focus the cat could
 

12211
05:21:12,360 --> 05:21:14,330
what should be the focus the cat could
have been more polished

12212
05:21:14,330 --> 05:21:14,340
have been more polished
 

12213
05:21:14,340 --> 05:21:17,990
have been more polished
but maybe I did turn off some blur in

12214
05:21:17,990 --> 05:21:18,000
but maybe I did turn off some blur in
 

12215
05:21:18,000 --> 05:21:21,470
but maybe I did turn off some blur in
the beginning of the stream last time

12216
05:21:21,470 --> 05:21:21,480
the beginning of the stream last time
 

12217
05:21:21,480 --> 05:21:23,390
the beginning of the stream last time
maybe it would have looked different but

12218
05:21:23,390 --> 05:21:23,400
maybe it would have looked different but
 

12219
05:21:23,400 --> 05:21:25,368
maybe it would have looked different but
no that was just general blur I don't

12220
05:21:25,368 --> 05:21:25,378
no that was just general blur I don't
 

12221
05:21:25,378 --> 05:21:26,690
no that was just general blur I don't
think it would have improved the cat

12222

05:21:26,700 --> 05:21:29,330
think it would have improved the cat
itself

12224

12229
05:21:34,798 --> 05:21:38,990
were like close-ups and then I felt like

um could have been
a bit improved
