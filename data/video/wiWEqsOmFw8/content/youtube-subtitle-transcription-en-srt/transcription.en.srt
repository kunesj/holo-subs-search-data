holds back

988
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:22,720
holds back
 

989
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,269

automatically tries to like
 

993
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,110
automatically tries to like
verify them and then it holds it back

994
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:32,120
verify them and then it holds it back
 

995
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,789
verify them and then it holds it back
and then it come like then then they

996

I'm not sure like I found out that
 

7427
03:29:35,960 --> 03:29:38,830
I'm not sure like I found out that
um you know it's it's a

7428
03:29:38,830 --> 03:29:38,840
um you know it's it's a
 

7429
03:29:38,840 --> 03:29:40,990
um you know it's it's a
chain

7430
03:29:40,990 --> 03:29:41,000
chain
 

7431
03:29:41,000 --> 03:29:46,910
chain
and um there there uh hotels in Europe

7432
03:29:46,910 --> 03:29:46,920
and um there there uh hotels in Europe
 

7433
03:29:46,920 --> 03:29:50,590
and um there there uh hotels in Europe
use similar mattresses but kind of

7434
03:29:50,590 --> 03:29:50,600
use similar mattresses but kind of
 

7435
03:29:50,600 --> 03:29:52,830
use similar mattresses but kind of
different but they're all kind of like

7436
03:29:52,830 --> 03:29:52,840
different but they're all kind of like
 

7437
03:29:52,840 --> 03:29:56,590
different but they're all kind of like
similar and um I could get one from a

7438
03:29:56,590 --> 03:29:56,600
similar and um I could get one from a
 

7439
03:29:56,600 --> 03:29:59,429
similar and um I could get one from a
European supplier I guess but it might

7440
03:29:59,429 --> 03:29:59,439
European supplier I guess but it might
 

7441
03:29:59,439 --> 03:30:01,990
European supplier I guess but it might
not be 100% the same and I'm not sure

7442
03:30:01,990 --> 03:30:02,000
not be 100% the same and I'm not sure
 

7443
03:30:02,000 --> 03:30:04,670
not be 100% the same and I'm not sure
there's no place to test it out I think

7444
03:30:04,670 --> 03:30:04,680
there's no place to test it out I think
 

7445
03:30:04,680 --> 03:30:06,510
there's no place to test it out I think
but I could hope that all the mattresses

7446
03:30:06,510 --> 03:30:06,520
but I could hope that all the mattresses
 

7447
03:30:06,520 --> 03:30:08,349
but I could hope that all the mattresses
are good because they're all expensive

7448
03:30:08,349 --> 03:30:08,359
are good because they're all expensive
 

7449
03:30:08,359 --> 03:30:09,930
are good because they're all expensive
and

7450
03:30:09,930 --> 03:30:09,940

7455
03:30:13,840 --> 03:30:16,469
stuff and and hopefully like they would
all be similar or I could try this stay

7456
03:30:16,469 --> 03:30:16,479
all be similar or I could try this stay
 

7457
03:30:16,479 --> 03:30:20,110
all be similar or I could try this stay
purposefully stay in one of the the

7458
03:30:20,110 --> 03:30:20,120
purposefully stay in one of the the
 

7459
03:30:20,120 --> 03:30:25,429
purposefully stay in one of the the
hotels from their chain in somewhere in

7460
03:30:25,429 --> 03:30:25,439
hotels from their chain in somewhere in
 

7461
03:30:25,439 --> 03:30:28,590
hotels from their chain in somewhere in
Europe and hope that they have those

7462
03:30:28,590 --> 03:30:28,600
Europe and hope that they have those
 

7463
03:30:28,600 --> 03:30:31,630
Europe and hope that they have those
matches that you

7464

know supposedly they should have yeah
 

7467
03:30:35,160 --> 03:30:39,150
know supposedly they should have yeah
and then I could make my decision

7468
03:30:39,150 --> 03:30:39,160
and then I could make my decision
 

7469
03:30:39,160 --> 03:30:42,030

some are definitely nice when they're a
 

9205
04:15:53,080 --> 04:15:55,389
some are definitely nice when they're a
little bit more simple but even the

9206
04:15:55,389 --> 04:15:55,399
little bit more simple but even the
 

9207
04:15:55,399 --> 04:15:58,030
little bit more simple but even the
simple ones can look a little bit more

9208
04:15:58,030 --> 04:15:58,040
simple ones can look a little bit more
 

9209
04:15:58,040 --> 04:16:00,070
simple ones can look a little bit more
special than they a little bit more

9210
04:16:00,070 --> 04:16:00,080
special than they a little bit more
 

9211
04:16:00,080 --> 04:16:02,469
special than they a little bit more
intricate than they actually are

9212
04:16:02,469 --> 04:16:02,479
intricate than they actually are
 

9213
04:16:02,479 --> 04:16:05,130

because then you have
formation and you got to like make sure

9230
04:16:24,269 --> 04:16:24,279
formation and you got to like make sure
 

9231
04:16:24,279 --> 04:16:26,710

04:34:31,390 --> 04:34:31,400
lengthy
 

9931
04:34:31,400 --> 04:34:34,990

score I would definitely have

9932
04:34:34,990 --> 04:34:35,000
score I would definitely have
 

9933
04:34:35,000 --> 04:34:40,109
score I would definitely have
to at some point maybe take like a more

9934
04:34:40,109 --> 04:34:40,119

 

9935
04:34:40,119 --> 04:34:44,590

chill couple of months or you know but

chill couple of months or you know but
 

9937
04:34:44,600 --> 04:34:47,551
chill couple of months or you know but
that will then lead to a

9938
04:34:47,551 --> 04:34:47,561
that will then lead to a
 

9939
04:34:47,561 --> 04:34:53,310
that will then lead to a
longer time all together so got to

9940
04:34:53,310 --> 04:34:53,320
longer time all together so got to
 

9941
04:34:53,320 --> 04:35:01,750
longer time all together so got to
think several steps ahead think long

9942
04:35:01,750 --> 04:35:01,760

 

9943
04:35:01,760 --> 04:35:04,830
