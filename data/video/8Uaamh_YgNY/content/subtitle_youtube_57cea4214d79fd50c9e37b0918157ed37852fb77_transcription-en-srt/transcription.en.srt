get the button to turn into n in that

1664
00:47:21,430 --> 00:47:21,440
get the button to turn into n in that
 

1665
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:22,829
get the button to turn into n in that
moment she will touch the N that's is

1666
00:47:22,829 --> 00:47:22,839
moment she will touch the N that's is
 

1667
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:24,870
moment she will touch the N that's is
below her so even if I cover n up a

1668
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:24,880
below her so even if I cover n up a
 

1669
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,069
below her so even if I cover n up a
little bit from this side it shouldn't

1670

little bit from this side it shouldn't
 

1671
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:28,870
little bit from this side it shouldn't
be too bad

1672
