3005
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:49,030
them inside of the hamper thing so I
still have to grab a couple towels

still have to grab a couple towels
 

3007
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:51,890

yeah that means I was in the electrical

3008
01:36:51,890 --> 01:36:51,900
yeah that means I was in the electrical
 

3009
01:36:51,900 --> 01:36:54,709
yeah that means I was in the electrical
I saw I was in the electron I was in the

3010
01:36:54,709 --> 01:36:54,719
I saw I was in the electron I was in the
 

3011
01:36:54,719 --> 01:36:56,810
I saw I was in the electron I was in the
middle I was in the middle bottom and

3012
01:36:56,810 --> 01:36:56,820
middle I was in the middle bottom and
 

3013
01:36:56,820 --> 01:36:59,149
middle I was in the middle bottom and
see that he was in the bottom but I

3014
01:36:59,149 --> 01:36:59,159
see that he was in the bottom but I
 

3015
01:36:59,159 --> 01:37:04,870
see that he was in the bottom but I
didn't see anyone it was too fast

01:37:04,870 --> 01:37:04,880

 

3017
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:08,209

that was that was way too fast it might
