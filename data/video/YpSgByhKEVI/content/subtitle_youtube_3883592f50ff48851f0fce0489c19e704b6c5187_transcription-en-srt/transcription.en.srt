5875
02:29:33,920 --> 02:29:35,630
oh we can C we can craft a du collector
that's what it is you can craft a dle

5876
02:29:35,630 --> 02:29:35,640
that's what it is you can craft a dle
 

5877
02:29:35,640 --> 02:29:37,750
that's what it is you can craft a dle
need to craft one of those so yeah if we

5878
02:29:37,750 --> 02:29:37,760
need to craft one of those so yeah if we
 

5879
02:29:37,760 --> 02:29:41,309
need to craft one of those so yeah if we
do that that would be nice yeah it's we

5880
02:29:41,309 --> 02:29:41,319
do that that would be nice yeah it's we
 

5881
02:29:41,319 --> 02:29:42,950
do that that would be nice yeah it's we
need something called a polymer

something or another a workstation too
 

5885
02:29:45,600 --> 02:29:48,670
something or another a workstation too
we have polymer oh yeah workstation uh

5886
02:29:48,670 --> 02:29:48,680
we have polymer oh yeah workstation uh
 

5887
02:29:48,680 --> 02:29:50,269
we have polymer oh yeah workstation uh
so a certain skill will unlock lock

5888
02:29:50,269 --> 02:29:50,279
so a certain skill will unlock lock
 

5889
02:29:50,279 --> 02:29:52,590
so a certain skill will unlock lock
being able to make the workstation is it
