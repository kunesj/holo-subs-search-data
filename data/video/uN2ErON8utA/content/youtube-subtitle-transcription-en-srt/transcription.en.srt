10078
04:21:48,950 --> 04:21:48,960
the end of the week I almost had it
 

10079
04:21:48,960 --> 04:21:49,790
the end of the week I almost had it
though

10080
04:21:49,790 --> 04:21:49,800
though
 

10081
04:21:49,800 --> 04:21:51,469
though
I almost was able to do it myself

10082
04:21:51,469 --> 04:21:51,479
I almost was able to do it myself
 

10083
04:21:51,479 --> 04:21:53,030
I almost was able to do it myself
because I had the model in there it was

10084
04:21:53,030 --> 04:21:53,040
because I had the model in there it was
 

10085
04:21:53,040 --> 04:21:54,650
because I had the model in there it was
just something about I guess the

10086
04:21:54,650 --> 04:21:54,660
just something about I guess the
 

10087
04:21:54,660 --> 04:21:56,269
just something about I guess the
polygons or whatever because we had to

10088
04:21:56,269 --> 04:21:56,279
polygons or whatever because we had to
 

10089
04:21:56,279 --> 04:21:58,550
polygons or whatever because we had to
size it down there's like a maximum size

10090
04:21:58,550 --> 04:21:58,560
size it down there's like a maximum size
 

10091
04:21:58,560 --> 04:22:01,429
size it down there's like a maximum size
for the model that you can put in to the

10092
04:22:01,429 --> 04:22:01,439
for the model that you can put in to the
 

10093
04:22:01,439 --> 04:22:04,610
for the model that you can put in to the
game and that's pretty small uh

10094
04:22:04,610 --> 04:22:04,620
game and that's pretty small uh
 

10095
04:22:04,620 --> 04:22:07,370
game and that's pretty small uh
originally it was like double for my

10096
04:22:07,370 --> 04:22:07,380
originally it was like double for my
 

10097
04:22:07,380 --> 04:22:10,610
originally it was like double for my
model's size and we signed it down that

10098
04:22:10,610 --> 04:22:10,620
model's size and we signed it down that
 

10099
04:22:10,620 --> 04:22:12,769
model's size and we signed it down that
probably messed up with the textures and

10100
04:22:12,769 --> 04:22:12,779
probably messed up with the textures and
 

10101
04:22:12,779 --> 04:22:14,750
probably messed up with the textures and
then when I put that into the game I was

10102
04:22:14,750 --> 04:22:14,760
then when I put that into the game I was
 

10103
04:22:14,760 --> 04:22:16,790
then when I put that into the game I was
like all glitching out in terms of

10104
04:22:16,790 --> 04:22:16,800
like all glitching out in terms of
 

10105
04:22:16,800 --> 04:22:19,420
like all glitching out in terms of
textures

10106
04:22:19,420 --> 04:22:19,430

04:22:23,929 --> 04:22:23,939
and we tried to figure it out and then
 

10111
04:22:23,939 --> 04:22:25,670
and we tried to figure it out and then
and then we fixed the textures but next

10112
04:22:25,670 --> 04:22:25,680
and then we fixed the textures but next
 

10113
04:22:25,680 --> 04:22:28,490
and then we fixed the textures but next
my body was just t-posing and not moving

04:22:28,490 --> 04:22:28,500
my body was just t-posing and not moving
 

10115

04:23:02,990 --> 04:23:03,000
original plan of doing it but now I
 

10139
04:23:03,000 --> 04:23:05,630
original plan of doing it but now I
reminded them

10140
04:23:05,630 --> 04:23:05,640

 

10141
04:23:05,640 --> 04:23:07,969

and I'm hoping that some people maybe

10142

and I'm hoping that some people maybe
 

10143
04:23:07,979 --> 04:23:11,210

expressions like this so it would be
 

10149
04:23:15,000 --> 04:23:23,050
expressions like this so it would be
really helpful

10150

difficult to handle is it I I need to
like look into it too maybe I could

10160
04:23:59,450 --> 04:23:59,460
like look into it too maybe I could
 

10161
04:23:59,460 --> 04:24:01,189
like look into it too maybe I could
figure it out too but

10162
04:24:01,189 --> 04:24:01,199
figure it out too but
 

10163
04:24:01,199 --> 04:24:03,050

I feel like you guys would have fun with

10164
04:24:03,050 --> 04:24:03,060
I feel like you guys would have fun with
 

10165

I feel like you guys would have fun with
it

10166
04:24:07,490 --> 04:24:07,500

 

10167
04:24:07,500 --> 04:24:10,269

some town and fans have made wishes

people couldn't make it and think like

10172
04:24:15,070 --> 04:24:15,080
people couldn't make it and think like
 

10173
04:24:15,080 --> 04:24:17,870
people couldn't make it and think like
for example he has access to my model

10174
04:24:17,870 --> 04:24:17,880
for example he has access to my model
 

10175
04:24:17,880 --> 04:24:19,670
for example he has access to my model
but I think he's probably not using it

10176
04:24:19,670 --> 04:24:19,680
but I think he's probably not using it
 

10177
04:24:19,680 --> 04:24:21,469
but I think he's probably not using it
for his private like

10178
04:24:21,469 --> 04:24:21,479
for his private like
 

10179
04:24:21,479 --> 04:24:23,150
for his private like
hobby videos

hobby videos
 

10181
04:24:23,160 --> 04:24:26,389
hobby videos
because he only has access to my model

10182
04:24:26,389 --> 04:24:26,399
because he only has access to my model
 

10183
04:24:26,399 --> 04:24:28,370
because he only has access to my model
because of the music video commissions

10184
04:24:28,370 --> 04:24:28,380
because of the music video commissions
 

10185
04:24:28,380 --> 04:24:31,969
because of the music video commissions
that we made and then in his other

10186
04:24:31,969 --> 04:24:31,979
that we made and then in his other
 

10187
04:24:31,979 --> 04:24:34,729
that we made and then in his other
videos like he wouldn't really have it

10188
04:24:34,729 --> 04:24:34,739
videos like he wouldn't really have it
 

10189
04:24:34,739 --> 04:24:36,469
videos like he wouldn't really have it
so he doesn't use it and he keeps on

10190
04:24:36,469 --> 04:24:36,479
so he doesn't use it and he keeps on
 

10191
04:24:36,479 --> 04:24:40,670
so he doesn't use it and he keeps on
using my my uh chibi model

10192

10779
04:39:05,520 --> 04:39:08,090

I was just hoping for them not to come
 

10785
04:39:11,699 --> 04:39:13,910
I was just hoping for them not to come
up in a test and the final one because I

10786
04:39:13,910 --> 04:39:13,920
up in a test and the final one because I
 

10787
04:39:13,920 --> 04:39:16,789
up in a test and the final one because I
knew I couldn't remember this [\h__\h] I was

whelmed with the with the highways and

10794
04:39:22,730 --> 04:39:22,740
whelmed with the with the highways and
 

10795
04:39:22,740 --> 04:39:24,230
whelmed with the with the highways and
there was um

10796
04:39:24,230 --> 04:39:24,240
there was um
 

10797
04:39:24,240 --> 04:39:26,209
there was um
other there was something else we had to

10798
04:39:26,209 --> 04:39:26,219
other there was something else we had to
 

10799
04:39:26,219 --> 04:39:27,830
other there was something else we had to
learn to besides highways and mountain

10800
04:39:27,830 --> 04:39:27,840
learn to besides highways and mountain
 

10801
04:39:27,840 --> 04:39:30,830
learn to besides highways and mountain
passes

10802
04:39:30,830 --> 04:39:30,840

 

10803
04:39:30,840 --> 04:39:32,810

I think we also had to know like every

10804
04:39:32,810 --> 04:39:32,820
I think we also had to know like every
 

10805
04:39:32,820 --> 04:39:35,390
I think we also had to know like every
connection

10806
04:39:35,390 --> 04:39:35,400

 

10807
04:39:35,400 --> 04:39:39,948

or so I don't know

10808
04:39:39,948 --> 04:39:39,958

 

10809
04:39:39,958 --> 04:39:42,708

and maybe other big roads I don't know I

10810
04:39:42,708 --> 04:39:42,718
and maybe other big roads I don't know I
 

10811
04:39:42,718 --> 04:39:43,850
and maybe other big roads I don't know I
don't know

10812
04:39:43,850 --> 04:39:43,860
don't know
 

10813
04:39:43,860 --> 04:39:45,890
don't know
it may not be entirely accurate but

10814
04:39:45,890 --> 04:39:45,900
it may not be entirely accurate but
 

10815
04:39:45,900 --> 04:39:49,070
it may not be entirely accurate but
still like nobody would would want you

10816
04:39:49,070 --> 04:39:49,080
still like nobody would would want you
 

10817
04:39:49,080 --> 04:39:55,010
still like nobody would would want you
or expect you to know that by heart

10818
04:39:55,010 --> 04:39:55,020

 

10819
04:39:55,020 --> 04:40:00,890

can look on the map always

10820
04:40:00,890 --> 04:40:00,900

 

10821
04:40:00,900 --> 04:40:03,110

so that was uh

10822
04:40:03,110 --> 04:40:03,120
so that was uh
 

10823
04:40:03,120 --> 04:40:06,050
so that was uh
unnecessary but I don't think I even

10824
04:40:06,050 --> 04:40:06,060
unnecessary but I don't think I even
 

10825
04:40:06,060 --> 04:40:07,970
unnecessary but I don't think I even
wasted my time with learning it anyway

10826
04:40:07,970 --> 04:40:07,980
wasted my time with learning it anyway
 

10827
04:40:07,980 --> 04:40:11,030
wasted my time with learning it anyway
and then thank God they only asked me a

but like damn that
 

11423
04:55:22,920 --> 04:55:27,590
but like damn that
that lag look

11424
04:55:27,590 --> 04:55:27,600

 

11425
04:55:27,600 --> 04:55:29,690

yeah and I'm not good at Mario our new

11426
04:55:29,690 --> 04:55:29,700
yeah and I'm not good at Mario our new
 

11427
04:55:29,700 --> 04:55:31,788
yeah and I'm not good at Mario our new
dad so I would have had to practice a

11428
04:55:31,788 --> 04:55:31,798
dad so I would have had to practice a
 

11429
04:55:31,798 --> 04:55:34,430
dad so I would have had to practice a
lot so even being useful

11430
04:55:34,430 --> 04:55:34,440
lot so even being useful
 

11431
04:55:34,440 --> 04:55:36,050
lot so even being useful
uh

11432
04:55:36,050 --> 04:55:36,060
uh
 

11433
04:55:36,060 --> 04:55:37,550
uh
and then

11434
04:55:37,550 --> 04:55:37,560
and then
 

11435
04:55:37,560 --> 04:55:39,680
and then
it would be ruined by the leg

11436
04:55:39,680 --> 04:55:39,690
it would be ruined by the leg
 

11437
04:55:39,690 --> 04:55:40,788

11440
04:55:43,368 --> 04:55:43,378
and just even even without the lag I
 

11441
04:55:43,378 --> 04:55:46,070
and just even even without the lag I
would have probably lost

11442
04:55:46,070 --> 04:55:46,080

 

11443
04:55:46,080 --> 04:55:48,410

ah yeah but that's the problem I mean

11470
04:56:23,330 --> 04:56:23,340

good that they're uh inviting like all

11472
04:56:25,970 --> 04:56:25,980
good that they're uh inviting like all
 

11473
04:56:25,980 --> 04:56:27,770
good that they're uh inviting like all
the branches but the problem with that

11474
04:56:27,770 --> 04:56:27,780
the branches but the problem with that
 

11475
04:56:27,780 --> 04:56:28,550
the branches but the problem with that
is

11476
04:56:28,550 --> 04:56:28,560
is
 

11477
04:56:28,560 --> 04:56:30,830
is
if you have all branches and you have

11478
04:56:30,830 --> 04:56:30,840
if you have all branches and you have
 

11479
04:56:30,840 --> 04:56:32,390
if you have all branches and you have
all servers

11480

and that's why I like because the the
 

11483
04:56:34,680 --> 04:56:37,128

04:56:37,128 --> 04:56:37,138
few groups where they were like
 

11485
