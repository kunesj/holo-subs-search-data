no no okay i thought that if i go back
 

9147
03:53:02,720 --> 03:53:04,630
no no okay i thought that if i go back
in this room that now there will be a

9148
03:53:04,630 --> 03:53:04,640
in this room that now there will be a

03:53:16,710 --> 03:53:16,720
many doors with keys though there's just
 

9161
03:53:16,720 --> 03:53:19,670
many doors with keys though there's just
this one and this one i suppose

9162
03:53:19,670 --> 03:53:19,680
this one and this one i suppose
 

9163
03:53:19,680 --> 03:53:29,670
this one and this one i suppose
so

9164
03:53:29,670 --> 03:53:29,680

 

9165
03:53:29,680 --> 03:53:34,389

i think i understand you mean here ah
 

9173
03:53:42,319 --> 03:53:43,910
i think i understand you mean here ah
probably hear them

9174
03:53:43,910 --> 03:53:43,920
probably hear them
 

9175
03:53:43,920 --> 03:53:45,510
probably hear them
because here

9176
03:53:45,510 --> 03:53:45,520
because here
 

9177
03:53:45,520 --> 03:53:47,429
because here
um

9178
03:53:47,429 --> 03:53:47,439
um
 

9179
03:53:47,439 --> 03:53:49,590
um
i guess was the first fight and then aha

9180
03:53:49,590 --> 03:53:49,600
i guess was the first fight and then aha
 

9181
03:53:49,600 --> 03:53:50,870
i guess was the first fight and then aha
this will be the second this will be the

9182
03:53:50,870 --> 03:53:50,880
this will be the second this will be the
 

9183
03:53:50,880 --> 03:53:52,389
this will be the second this will be the
third this will be the fourth baby and

9184
03:53:52,389 --> 03:53:52,399
third this will be the fourth baby and
 

9185
03:53:52,399 --> 03:53:54,950
third this will be the fourth baby and
this will be the final maybe

9186
03:53:54,950 --> 03:53:54,960
this will be the final maybe
 

9187
03:53:54,960 --> 03:53:57,830
this will be the final maybe
maybe that's the logic here

9188
03:53:57,830 --> 03:53:57,840
maybe that's the logic here
 

9189
03:53:57,840 --> 03:53:59,349
maybe that's the logic here
um

9190
03:53:59,349 --> 03:53:59,359
