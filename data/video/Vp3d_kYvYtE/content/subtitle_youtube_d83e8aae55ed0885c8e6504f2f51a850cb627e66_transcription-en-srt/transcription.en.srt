461
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,270
no unable to move but then we missed the
raid what does this mean for us that the

462
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:18,280
raid what does this mean for us that the
 

463
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,789
raid what does this mean for us that the
next raid will be super strong we're

464
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:20,799
next raid will be super strong we're
 

465
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,029

466
00:17:23,029 --> 00:17:23,039
ready we're going to do it we're going
 

467
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,350
ready we're going to do it we're going
to it's okay we strong together I think

468
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:26,360
to it's okay we strong together I think
 

469
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,189
to it's okay we strong together I think
that it also has to do with our levels

470
00:17:28,189 --> 00:17:28,199
that it also has to do with our levels
 

471
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:30,710
that it also has to do with our levels
and stuff

472
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:30,720
and stuff
 

473
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,510
and stuff
I think so that's how it was in the

upgrade well again the the the whole
perimeter is really really big it's like

1396
00:40:09,309 --> 00:40:09,319
perimeter is really really big it's like
 

1397
00:40:09,319 --> 00:40:14,550
perimeter is really really big it's like
really really big so mhm I think yeah

1398
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:14,560
really really big so mhm I think yeah
 

1399

you guys aren't even at the edge if you

1400
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:16,640
you guys aren't even at the edge if you
 

1401
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,910
you guys aren't even at the edge if you
dig that way so okay it is getting

1402
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:19,920
dig that way so okay it is getting
 

1403
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,510
dig that way so okay it is getting
pretty late we're going to have to be

careful
yeah wonder where we can maybe we can

1408
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:25,400
yeah wonder where we can maybe we can
 

1409
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,750
yeah wonder where we can maybe we can
find a place to hold up in the night

1410
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:28,760
find a place to hold up in the night

this
 

1417
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:38,550
this
hole maybe we could actually like make a

1418
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:38,560
hole maybe we could actually like make a
 

1419
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,030
hole maybe we could actually like make a
literal you know like a little to like a

1420
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:41,040
literal you know like a little to like a
 

1421
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,109
literal you know like a little to like a
little oh like a little hide out yeah

1422
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:44,119
little oh like a little hide out yeah
 

1423

guys are on the very edge of the
perimeter

1458
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:28,040
perimeter
 

1459
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:31,910
perimeter
now um so like somewhere around where I

1460
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:31,920
now um so like somewhere around where I
 

1461
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:39,069
now um so like somewhere around where I
am

1462
00:41:39,069 --> 00:41:39,079

 

1463
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:43,550

close again this is we're at the center
 

1471
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:53,030
close again this is we're at the center
of the perimeter now mhm so it should be

1472
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:53,040
of the perimeter now mhm so it should be
 

1473
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,309
of the perimeter now mhm so it should be
around

1474
00:41:54,309 --> 00:41:54,319
around
 

1475
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:58,589
