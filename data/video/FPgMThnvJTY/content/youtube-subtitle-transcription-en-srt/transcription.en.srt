100
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:51,520
then you might notice then that the
 

101
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,870
then you might notice then that the
original

102
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:52,880
original
 

103
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,230

is actually uh slower but

104
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:56,240
is actually uh slower but
 

105
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,270

um
 

107
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,309
um
yeah so for example the the verse

108
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:00,319

yeah so for example the the verse
i think everything is slower but

110
00:06:01,749 --> 00:06:01,759

111
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,110
i think everything is slower but
especially the verse is really

112
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:03,120
especially the verse is really
 

113
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,469
especially the verse is really
noticeable

114
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:04,479
noticeable
 

115
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,270
noticeable
um because and also the key is different

it was different and the the the verse

124
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:14,960

yeah twitter edit button would be nice
 

185
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,270
yeah twitter edit button would be nice
or more a simpler fix than that but i

186
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:45,280
or more a simpler fix than that but i
 

187
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,550
or more a simpler fix than that but i
understand why you you can't no i mean

188
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:48,560
understand why you you can't no i mean
 

189
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,589
understand why you you can't no i mean
i think you could do it uh um switching

190
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:51,599
i think you could do it uh um switching
 

191
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,029
i think you could do it uh um switching
out videos on youtube before they are

192
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:55,039
out videos on youtube before they are
 

193
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,189
out videos on youtube before they are
uploaded like reusing the same slot

194
00:07:59,189 --> 00:07:59,199
uploaded like reusing the same slot
 

195
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,510
uploaded like reusing the same slot
and just switching out the video would

196
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:01,520
and just switching out the video would
 

197
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,589
and just switching out the video would
have been perfect

198
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:03,599
have been perfect
 

199
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,990
have been perfect
i mean

200
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:06,000
i mean
 

201
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,749
i mean
i think you know i thought maybe they

202
00:08:07,749 --> 00:08:07,759
i think you know i thought maybe they
 

203
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,270
i think you know i thought maybe they
wouldn't do it because what if it's a

204
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:09,280
wouldn't do it because what if it's a
 

205
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,869
wouldn't do it because what if it's a
completely different video but i think

206
00:08:10,869 --> 00:08:10,879
completely different video but i think
 

207
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,110
completely different video but i think
it's before after uploading that would

208
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:13,120
it's before after uploading that would
 

209
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,510
it's before after uploading that would
be troublesome but before uploading

210
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:15,520
be troublesome but before uploading
 

211
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,909
be troublesome but before uploading
uh before releasing something before

212
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:17,919
uh before releasing something before
 

213
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,670
uh before releasing something before
premiere so i think it would make sense

214
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:19,680
premiere so i think it would make sense
 

215
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,029
premiere so i think it would make sense
because youtube's um automatic sensors

216
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:23,039
because youtube's um automatic sensors
 

217
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,790
because youtube's um automatic sensors
are gonna go through it anyway and see

218
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:24,800
are gonna go through it anyway and see
 

219
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,950
are gonna go through it anyway and see
if there's some different tracks there

220
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:26,960
if there's some different tracks there
 

221
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,909
if there's some different tracks there
that are copyrighted or whatever so if

222
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:29,919
that are copyrighted or whatever so if
 

223
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,909
that are copyrighted or whatever so if
it's not publicized yet i think it would

224
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:31,919
it's not publicized yet i think it would
 

225
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,350
it's not publicized yet i think it would
make sense

226
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:33,360
make sense
 

227
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,750
make sense
but yeah that is um

00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:35,760
but yeah that is um
 

229
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,230
but yeah that is um
too useful to be

230
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:38,240

231
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,790

325
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,750
