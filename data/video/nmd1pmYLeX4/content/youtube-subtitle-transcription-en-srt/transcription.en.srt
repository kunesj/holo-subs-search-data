kind of out of that came that one asset
 

2093
00:56:03,559 --> 00:56:07,789
kind of out of that came that one asset
where gauda was like uh tummy down on a

2094
00:56:07,789 --> 00:56:07,799
where gauda was like uh tummy down on a
 

2095
00:56:07,799 --> 00:56:10,670
where gauda was like uh tummy down on a
couch with her legs in the back like

2096
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:10,680
couch with her legs in the back like
 

2097
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:13,870
couch with her legs in the back like
going back and forth yeah that one was

2098
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:13,880
going back and forth yeah that one was
 

2099
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:17,789
going back and forth yeah that one was
quite quite intricate and really cute

2100
00:56:17,789 --> 00:56:17,799
quite quite intricate and really cute
 

2101
00:56:17,799 --> 00:56:19,630
quite quite intricate and really cute
yeah I remember her using that I think

2102
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:19,640
yeah I remember her using that I think
 

2103
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:21,870
yeah I remember her using that I think
that is something that she kind of uh

2104
00:56:21,870 --> 00:56:21,880
that is something that she kind of uh
 

2105
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:24,589
that is something that she kind of uh
you know came up with herself but maybe

2106
00:56:24,589 --> 00:56:24,599
you know came up with herself but maybe
 

2107
00:56:24,599 --> 00:56:26,910
you know came up with herself but maybe
inspired a little bit yeah I think

2108
00:56:26,910 --> 00:56:26,920
inspired a little bit yeah I think
 

2109
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:29,990
inspired a little bit yeah I think
possibly surely she had her own idea but

2110
00:56:29,990 --> 00:56:30,000
possibly surely she had her own idea but
 

2111
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,029
possibly surely she had her own idea but
I think it might have been

2112
00:56:31,029 --> 00:56:31,039
I think it might have been
 

2113
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:34,430
I think it might have been
subconsciously at least inspired by

2114
00:56:34,430 --> 00:56:34,440
subconsciously at least inspired by
 

2115
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:37,470

want most out of community cuz sometimes

that I'm bringing this up is I have a

2402
01:04:05,829 --> 01:04:05,839
that I'm bringing this up is I have a
 

2403
01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:10,190
that I'm bringing this up is I have a
confession to make H at the time of this

2404
01:04:10,190 --> 01:04:10,200
confession to make H at the time of this
 

2405
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:12,349
confession to make H at the time of this
collaboration which is like two or three

2406
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:12,359
collaboration which is like two or three
 

2407
01:04:12,359 --> 01:04:14,990
collaboration which is like two or three
years ago probably three years I did not

2408
01:04:14,990 --> 01:04:15,000
years ago probably three years I did not
 

2409
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,750
years ago probably three years I did not
know how to read clocks and I was just

2410
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:16,760
know how to read clocks and I was just
 

2411
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:18,789
know how to read clocks and I was just
incredibly stressed out by the situation

2412
01:04:18,789 --> 01:04:18,799
incredibly stressed out by the situation
 

2413
01:04:18,799 --> 01:04:21,349
incredibly stressed out by the situation
we were in and I thought oh my God in

2414
01:04:21,349 --> 01:04:21,359
we were in and I thought oh my God in
 

2415
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:24,069
we were in and I thought oh my God in
order to to solve this riddle I probably

2416
01:04:24,069 --> 01:04:24,079
order to to solve this riddle I probably
 

2417
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:25,870
order to to solve this riddle I probably
have to know how to read clocks so let

2418
01:04:25,870 --> 01:04:25,880
have to know how to read clocks so let
 

2419
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:28,349
have to know how to read clocks so let
me quickly excuse myself on the toilet

2420
01:04:28,349 --> 01:04:28,359
me quickly excuse myself on the toilet
 

2421
01:04:28,359 --> 01:04:31,150
me quickly excuse myself on the toilet
and look up the solution there um but

2422
01:04:31,150 --> 01:04:31,160
and look up the solution there um but
 

2423
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:33,589
and look up the solution there um but
the solution turned out to be something

2424
01:04:33,589 --> 01:04:33,599
the solution turned out to be something
 

2425
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:35,230
the solution turned out to be something
where you don't have to read clocks but

2426
01:04:35,230 --> 01:04:35,240
where you don't have to read clocks but
 

2427
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:36,829
where you don't have to read clocks but
I ended up just like reading the whole

2428
01:04:36,829 --> 01:04:36,839
I ended up just like reading the whole
 

2429
01:04:36,839 --> 01:04:39,190
I ended up just like reading the whole
thing and then I knew everything uh so I

2430
01:04:39,190 --> 01:04:39,200
thing and then I knew everything uh so I
 

2431
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,750
thing and then I knew everything uh so I
cheated but also it's so embarrassing

2432
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:41,760
cheated but also it's so embarrassing
 

2433
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:45,230
cheated but also it's so embarrassing
I'm so

2434
01:04:45,230 --> 01:04:45,240

 

2435
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:47,910

embarrassed you looked it up well yeah

2436
01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:47,920
embarrassed you looked it up well yeah
 

2437
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:49,430
embarrassed you looked it up well yeah
cuz I thought like it would be so

2438
01:04:49,430 --> 01:04:49,440
cuz I thought like it would be so
 

2439
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:52,349
cuz I thought like it would be so
embarrassing if I can't because like we

2440
01:04:52,349 --> 01:04:52,359
embarrassing if I can't because like we
 

2441
01:04:52,359 --> 01:04:54,470
embarrassing if I can't because like we
had two different povs we see different

2442
01:04:54,470 --> 01:04:54,480
had two different povs we see different
 

2443
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:57,109
had two different povs we see different
things and so we have to communicate

2444
01:04:57,109 --> 01:04:57,119
things and so we have to communicate
 

2445
01:04:57,119 --> 01:04:59,870
things and so we have to communicate
what we see at all times and if I can't

2446
01:04:59,870 --> 01:04:59,880
what we see at all times and if I can't
 

2447
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:01,430
what we see at all times and if I can't
even tell you what time it is because

2448
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:01,440
even tell you what time it is because
 

2449
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,269
even tell you what time it is because
that's probably the first thing we would

2450
01:05:03,269 --> 01:05:03,279
that's probably the first thing we would
 

2451
01:05:03,279 --> 01:05:05,230
that's probably the first thing we would
consider we would think like oh surely

2452
01:05:05,230 --> 01:05:05,240
consider we would think like oh surely
 

2453
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:06,670
consider we would think like oh surely
it has something to do with the time on

2454
01:05:06,670 --> 01:05:06,680
it has something to do with the time on
 

2455
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:07,990
it has something to do with the time on
the

2456
01:05:07,990 --> 01:05:08,000
the
 

2457
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,349
the
clock but yeah um did you think it was

2458
01:05:12,349 --> 01:05:12,359
clock but yeah um did you think it was
 

2459
01:05:12,359 --> 01:05:16,630
clock but yeah um did you think it was
weird at the time no no I don't think so

2460
01:05:16,630 --> 01:05:16,640
weird at the time no no I don't think so
 

2461
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:17,950
weird at the time no no I don't think so
I mean you know things happen that

2462
01:05:17,950 --> 01:05:17,960
I mean you know things happen that
 

2463
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:19,470
I mean you know things happen that
happens quite often in collabs you know

2464
01:05:19,470 --> 01:05:19,480
happens quite often in collabs you know
 

2465
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,950
happens quite often in collabs you know
where's got to go to idle meeting yeah

2466
01:05:21,950 --> 01:05:21,960
where's got to go to idle meeting yeah
 

2467
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:23,990
where's got to go to idle meeting yeah
but was it not weird how I came back

2468
01:05:23,990 --> 01:05:24,000
but was it not weird how I came back
 

2469
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:28,589
but was it not weird how I came back
seemingly so much SM

2470
01:05:28,589 --> 01:05:28,599

 

2471
01:05:28,599 --> 01:05:31,950

no I guess I didn't really yeah I didn't

2472
01:05:31,950 --> 01:05:31,960
no I guess I didn't really yeah I didn't
 

2473
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:34,470
no I guess I didn't really yeah I didn't
I didn't think of that I didn't think

2474
01:05:34,470 --> 01:05:34,480
I didn't think of that I didn't think
 

2475
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:36,349
I didn't think of that I didn't think
you would do that that's all yeah

2476
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:36,359
you would do that that's all yeah
 

2477
01:05:36,359 --> 01:05:38,549
you would do that that's all yeah
normally I don't think I was that useful

2478
01:05:38,549 --> 01:05:38,559
normally I don't think I was that useful
 

2479
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:41,269
normally I don't think I was that useful
throughout our collabs of this game

2480
01:05:41,269 --> 01:05:41,279
throughout our collabs of this game
 

2481
01:05:41,279 --> 01:05:43,670
throughout our collabs of this game
like yeah it was always quite hard to

2482
01:05:43,670 --> 01:05:43,680
like yeah it was always quite hard to
 

2483
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:46,710
like yeah it was always quite hard to
find Solutions about our brains yeah

2484
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:46,720
find Solutions about our brains yeah
 

2485
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:48,829
find Solutions about our brains yeah
that's a tough puzzle game yeah it was

2486
01:05:48,829 --> 01:05:48,839
that's a tough puzzle game yeah it was
 

2487
01:05:48,839 --> 01:05:51,150
that's a tough puzzle game yeah it was
really difficult but yeah so by now I

2488
01:05:51,150 --> 01:05:51,160
really difficult but yeah so by now I
 

2489
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:54,390
really difficult but yeah so by now I
want to clarify I learned how to read

2490
01:05:54,390 --> 01:05:54,400
want to clarify I learned how to read
 

2491
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:57,549
want to clarify I learned how to read
the clock uh oh because of this um yeah

2492
01:05:57,549 --> 01:05:57,559
the clock uh oh because of this um yeah
 

2493
01:05:57,559 --> 01:05:59,829
the clock uh oh because of this um yeah
I think this one really stressed me out

2494
01:05:59,829 --> 01:05:59,839
I think this one really stressed me out
 

2495
01:05:59,839 --> 01:06:01,670
I think this one really stressed me out
I was like this can't happen to me again

2496
01:06:01,670 --> 01:06:01,680
I was like this can't happen to me again
 

2497
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,990
I was like this can't happen to me again
on stream what if I really am confronted

2498
01:06:03,990 --> 01:06:04,000
on stream what if I really am confronted
 

2499
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,589
on stream what if I really am confronted
with something in the game again where I

2500
01:06:05,589 --> 01:06:05,599
with something in the game again where I
 

2501
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:07,349
with something in the game again where I
have to read the

2502
01:06:07,349 --> 01:06:07,359
have to read the
 

2503
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:10,750
have to read the
clock I cannot get out of it anymore in

2504
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:10,760
clock I cannot get out of it anymore in
 

2505
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:12,510
clock I cannot get out of it anymore in
elementary school anything you didn't do

2506
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:12,520
elementary school anything you didn't do
 

2507
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:14,630
elementary school anything you didn't do
like little worksheets where you had to

2508
01:06:14,630 --> 01:06:14,640
like little worksheets where you had to
 

2509
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:17,470
like little worksheets where you had to
learn the time I think

2510
01:06:17,470 --> 01:06:17,480
learn the time I think
 

2511
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:22,029
learn the time I think
like um not really like sometimes rarely

2512
01:06:22,029 --> 01:06:22,039
like um not really like sometimes rarely
 

2513
01:06:22,039 --> 01:06:25,630
like um not really like sometimes rarely
it would come up in like English class

2514
01:06:25,630 --> 01:06:25,640
it would come up in like English class
 

2515
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:27,950
it would come up in like English class
like normally English class yeah like

2516
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:27,960
like normally English class yeah like
 

2517
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:31,150
like normally English class yeah like
they would check if just as an exercise

2518
01:06:31,150 --> 01:06:31,160
they would check if just as an exercise
 

2519
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:33,069
they would check if just as an exercise
to know if we know how to say the time

2520
01:06:33,069 --> 01:06:33,079
to know if we know how to say the time
 

2521
01:06:33,079 --> 01:06:36,069
to know if we know how to say the time
in English cuz first language is German

2522
01:06:36,069 --> 01:06:36,079
in English cuz first language is German
 

2523
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:38,549
in English cuz first language is German
and then they would like point at people

2524
01:06:38,549 --> 01:06:38,559
and then they would like point at people
 

2525
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:40,349
and then they would like point at people
in the classroom and like you read it

2526
01:06:40,349 --> 01:06:40,359
in the classroom and like you read it
 

2527
01:06:40,359 --> 01:06:42,710
in the classroom and like you read it
out you read it out but I was mostly

2528
01:06:42,710 --> 01:06:42,720
out you read it out but I was mostly
 

2529
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:46,430
out you read it out but I was mostly
always lucky enough to evade that evade

2530
01:06:46,430 --> 01:06:46,440
always lucky enough to evade that evade
 

2531
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:49,630
always lucky enough to evade that evade
avoid that yeah and never be called so

2532
01:06:49,630 --> 01:06:49,640
avoid that yeah and never be called so
 

2533
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:52,510
avoid that yeah and never be called so
and then sometimes in math class I guess

2534
01:06:52,510 --> 01:06:52,520
and then sometimes in math class I guess
 

2535
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:56,430
and then sometimes in math class I guess
it would be in some rich

2536
01:06:56,430 --> 01:06:56,440
it would be in some rich
 

2537
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:59,829
it would be in some rich
um well you wait so you guys there's

2538
01:06:59,829 --> 01:06:59,839
um well you wait so you guys there's
 

2539
01:06:59,839 --> 01:07:02,670
um well you wait so you guys there's
clocks there right yeah would just all

2540
01:07:02,670 --> 01:07:02,680
clocks there right yeah would just all
 

2541
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:04,910
clocks there right yeah would just all
never I have this thing where when

2542
01:07:04,910 --> 01:07:04,920
never I have this thing where when
 

2543
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:08,109
never I have this thing where when
there's no digital clock around I've and

2544
01:07:08,109 --> 01:07:08,119
there's no digital clock around I've and
 

2545
01:07:08,119 --> 01:07:09,309
there's no digital clock around I've and
I really need to know the time and I

2546
01:07:09,309 --> 01:07:09,319
I really need to know the time and I
 

2547
01:07:09,319 --> 01:07:10,750
I really need to know the time and I
don't have my phone or anything either

2548
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:10,760
don't have my phone or anything either
 

2549
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,589
don't have my phone or anything either
and the only thing there is is a clock

2550
01:07:12,589 --> 01:07:12,599
and the only thing there is is a clock
 

2551
01:07:12,599 --> 01:07:14,910
and the only thing there is is a clock
on the wall like a real one uh I will

2552
01:07:14,910 --> 01:07:14,920
on the wall like a real one uh I will
 

2553
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:16,710
on the wall like a real one uh I will
like maybe ask someone I will pretend

2554
01:07:16,710 --> 01:07:16,720
like maybe ask someone I will pretend
 

2555
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:18,990
like maybe ask someone I will pretend
that I didn't see the clock in the room

2556
01:07:18,990 --> 01:07:19,000
that I didn't see the clock in the room
 

2557

that was I think I want to say that was
the first one that we had the camera

2876
01:14:44,030 --> 01:14:44,040
the first one that we had the camera
 

2877
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:47,510
the first one that we had the camera
system set up for so there were so good

2878
01:14:47,510 --> 01:14:47,520
system set up for so there were so good
 

2879
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:49,149
system set up for so there were so good
yeah there were a lot of nice shots

2880
01:14:49,149 --> 01:14:49,159
yeah there were a lot of nice shots
 

2881
01:14:49,159 --> 01:14:51,149
yeah there were a lot of nice shots
compared to the previous ones that we

2882
01:14:51,149 --> 01:14:51,159
compared to the previous ones that we
 

2883
01:14:51,159 --> 01:14:52,270
compared to the previous ones that we
had where we were just using the

2884
01:14:52,270 --> 01:14:52,280
had where we were just using the
 

2885
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:55,709
had where we were just using the
handheld camera mm uh

2886
01:14:55,709 --> 01:14:55,719
handheld camera mm uh
 

2887
01:14:55,719 --> 01:14:57,990
handheld camera mm uh

beforehand yeah yeah there were

2894
01:15:05,790 --> 01:15:05,800
beforehand yeah yeah there were
 

2895
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:08,430
beforehand yeah yeah there were
different 3D artists who worked on like

2896
01:15:08,430 --> 01:15:08,440
different 3D artists who worked on like
 

2897
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:10,550
different 3D artists who worked on like
all of the ornaments that we use and

2898
01:15:10,550 --> 01:15:10,560
all of the ornaments that we use and
 

2899
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:12,070
all of the ornaments that we use and
then of course Cil did like the

map and then I guess what goes into

2906
01:15:20,910 --> 01:15:20,920
map and then I guess what goes into
 

2907
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:22,709
map and then I guess what goes into
planning them huh

2908
01:15:22,709 --> 01:15:22,719
planning them huh

you know talent wise and then planning

2922
01:15:42,189 --> 01:15:42,199
you know talent wise and then planning
 

2923
01:15:42,199 --> 01:15:45,590
you know talent wise and then planning
from there is like uh does everybody

2924
01:15:45,590 --> 01:15:45,600
from there is like uh does everybody
 

2925
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:48,510
from there is like uh does everybody
have a model is a model in theme is it

2926
01:15:48,510 --> 01:15:48,520
have a model is a model in theme is it
 

2927
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:50,669
have a model is a model in theme is it
is it working properly does is the

2928
01:15:50,669 --> 01:15:50,679
is it working properly does is the
 

2929
01:15:50,679 --> 01:15:53,149
is it working properly does is the
tracking working properly making sure

2930
01:15:53,149 --> 01:15:53,159
tracking working properly making sure
 

2931
01:15:53,159 --> 01:15:55,390
tracking working properly making sure
like we would do a lot of testing for

2932
01:15:55,390 --> 01:15:55,400
like we would do a lot of testing for
 

2933
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:57,310
like we would do a lot of testing for
every model to make sure that nothing on

2934
01:15:57,310 --> 01:15:57,320
every model to make sure that nothing on
 

2935
01:15:57,320 --> 01:16:00,669
every model to make sure that nothing on
it was you know broken in VR chat um and

2936
01:16:00,669 --> 01:16:00,679
it was you know broken in VR chat um and
 

2937
01:16:00,679 --> 01:16:03,350
it was you know broken in VR chat um and
also we always tested so much and then

2938
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:03,360
also we always tested so much and then
 

2939
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:05,149
also we always tested so much and then
usually we would meet up like you would

2940
01:16:05,149 --> 01:16:05,159
usually we would meet up like you would
 

2941
01:16:05,159 --> 01:16:07,229
usually we would meet up like you would
ask us to meet up maybe an hour before

2942
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:07,239
ask us to meet up maybe an hour before
 

2943
01:16:07,239 --> 01:16:08,790
ask us to meet up maybe an hour before
and you would F down an hour before is

2944
01:16:08,790 --> 01:16:08,800
and you would F down an hour before is
 

2945
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:11,709
and you would F down an hour before is
enough time but my God we always had

2946
01:16:11,709 --> 01:16:11,719
enough time but my God we always had
 

2947
01:16:11,719 --> 01:16:13,709
enough time but my God we always had
delays because there were always so many

2948
01:16:13,709 --> 01:16:13,719
delays because there were always so many
 

2949
01:16:13,719 --> 01:16:15,830
delays because there were always so many
problems that appear right everybody's

2950
01:16:15,830 --> 01:16:15,840
problems that appear right everybody's
 

2951
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:17,550

of us were really excited to use full

2956
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:21,920
of us were really excited to use full
 

2957
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:24,430
of us were really excited to use full
body tracking and stuff but with VR full

2958
01:16:24,430 --> 01:16:24,440
body tracking and stuff but with VR full
 

2959
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:26,390
body tracking and stuff but with VR full
body track there's quite a lot of issues

2960
01:16:26,390 --> 01:16:26,400
body track there's quite a lot of issues
 

2961
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:28,270
body track there's quite a lot of issues
that you can run into and even though we

2962
01:16:28,270 --> 01:16:28,280
that you can run into and even though we
 

2963
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:30,430
that you can run into and even though we
would have it set up before stream kind

2964
01:16:30,430 --> 01:16:30,440
would have it set up before stream kind
 

2965
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:33,950
would have it set up before stream kind
of ready to go and then as we're kind of

2966
01:16:33,950 --> 01:16:33,960
of ready to go and then as we're kind of
 

2967
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:36,310
of ready to go and then as we're kind of
you know preparing to really go live

2968
01:16:36,310 --> 01:16:36,320
you know preparing to really go live
 

2969
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:38,430
you know preparing to really go live

2973
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:44,070
working what do we do and then it's kind
of really really fast um Tech Solutions

trying to juggle multiple things at once

2976
01:16:46,270 --> 01:16:46,280
trying to juggle multiple things at once
 

2977
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:48,310
trying to juggle multiple things at once
so we can try to start on time or try to

2978
01:16:48,310 --> 01:16:48,320
so we can try to start on time or try to
 

2979
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:49,870
so we can try to start on time or try to
figure out how long it will take before

2980
01:16:49,870 --> 01:16:49,880
figure out how long it will take before
 

2981
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:52,910
figure out how long it will take before
we can fix it and get everything working

2982
01:16:52,910 --> 01:16:52,920
we can fix it and get everything working
 

2983
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:55,229
we can fix it and get everything working
we made people wait a lot but it was

2984
01:16:55,229 --> 01:16:55,239
we made people wait a lot but it was
 

2985

01:16:57,159 --> 01:16:59,310
always worth
it wait sorry this will add more to your

2988

it wait sorry this will add more to your
 

2989
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:02,550
it wait sorry this will add more to your
translation but uh I had a lot of fun

2990
01:17:02,550 --> 01:17:02,560
translation but uh I had a lot of fun
 

2991
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:05,030
translation but uh I had a lot of fun
designing the camera controls that we

2992
01:17:05,030 --> 01:17:05,040
designing the camera controls that we
 

2993
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:08,149
designing the camera controls that we
ended up using that now we've used for a

2994
01:17:08,149 --> 01:17:08,159
ended up using that now we've used for a
 

2995
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:10,030
ended up using that now we've used for a
few VR things and I think even other

2996
01:17:10,030 --> 01:17:10,040
few VR things and I think even other
 

2997
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:12,189
few VR things and I think even other
people have used it too for their VR

2998
01:17:12,189 --> 01:17:12,199
people have used it too for their VR
 

2999

01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:35,590
branches yeah yeah so I'm glad I'm glad
that's why I made it uh hoping that

3014
01:17:35,590 --> 01:17:35,600
that's why I made it uh hoping that
 

3015
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:37,830
that's why I made it uh hoping that
other people could also benefit from it

3016
01:17:37,830 --> 01:17:37,840
other people could also benefit from it
 

3017
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:39,189
other people could also benefit from it
and of course I didn't do the coding or

3018
01:17:39,189 --> 01:17:39,199
and of course I didn't do the coding or
 

3019
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:41,430
and of course I didn't do the coding or
anything from it but um I did design

3020
01:17:41,430 --> 01:17:41,440
anything from it but um I did design
 

3021
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:44,189
anything from it but um I did design
like the console and kind of layout for

3022
01:17:44,189 --> 01:17:44,199
like the console and kind of layout for
 

3023
01:17:44,199 --> 01:17:45,950
like the console and kind of layout for
how it should work so somebody could

3024
01:17:45,950 --> 01:17:45,960
how it should work so somebody could
 

3025
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:49,550
how it should work so somebody could
operate it and yeah wow like the

3026
01:17:49,550 --> 01:17:49,560
operate it and yeah wow like the
 

3027
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:52,350
operate it and yeah wow like the
blueprint basically I don't know how to

3028
01:17:52,350 --> 01:17:52,360
blueprint basically I don't know how to
 

3029
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:54,110
blueprint basically I don't know how to
say that in Japanese but oh well let's

3030
01:17:54,110 --> 01:17:54,120
say that in Japanese but oh well let's
 

3031
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:57,950
say that in Japanese but oh well let's

question okay besides 3D in VR you then

3242
01:23:52,950 --> 01:23:52,960
question okay besides 3D in VR you then
 

3243
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:55,270
question okay besides 3D in VR you then
went as far as making your own 3D Studio

3244
01:23:55,270 --> 01:23:55,280
went as far as making your own 3D Studio
 

3245
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:56,709
went as far as making your own 3D Studio
is that something you always wanted to

3246

3259
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:16,669
because we couldn't use a Japanese
Studio yet yeah we we had our 3D yeah

3260
01:24:16,669 --> 01:24:16,679
Studio yet yeah we we had our 3D yeah
 

3261
01:24:16,679 --> 01:24:18,629
Studio yet yeah we we had our 3D yeah
but we we didn't have access to the tech

3262
01:24:18,629 --> 01:24:18,639
but we we didn't have access to the tech
 

3263
01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:21,430
but we we didn't have access to the tech
to do it and so my brain is always

3264
01:24:21,430 --> 01:24:21,440
to do it and so my brain is always
 

3265
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:23,870
to do it and so my brain is always
running in kind of like problem solving

3266
01:24:23,870 --> 01:24:23,880
running in kind of like problem solving
 

3267
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:28,110
running in kind of like problem solving
mode how can we solve this problem and I

3268
01:24:28,110 --> 01:24:28,120
mode how can we solve this problem and I
 

3269
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:29,910

that that was like something that came
 

3305
01:25:14,199 --> 01:25:17,990
that that was like something that came
up by me wanting to yeah I didn't set I

3306
01:25:17,990 --> 01:25:18,000
up by me wanting to yeah I didn't set I
 

3307
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,510
up by me wanting to yeah I didn't set I
didn't set out to do that specifically

3308
01:25:20,510 --> 01:25:20,520
didn't set out to do that specifically
 

3309
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:22,510
didn't set out to do that specifically
but it just kind of was like a whim and

3310
01:25:22,510 --> 01:25:22,520
but it just kind of was like a whim and
 

3311
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:24,109
but it just kind of was like a whim and
I just followed it and you know it

3312
01:25:24,109 --> 01:25:24,119
I just followed it and you know it
 

3313

I just followed it and you know it
really really worked out and that's kind

3314
01:25:25,709 --> 01:25:25,719
really really worked out and that's kind
 

3315
01:25:25,719 --> 01:25:27,830
really really worked out and that's kind
of how I do a lot of stuff which is

3316
01:25:27,830 --> 01:25:27,840
of how I do a lot of stuff which is
 

3317
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:30,310
of how I do a lot of stuff which is
probably not a good idea cuz it can be a

3318
01:25:30,310 --> 01:25:30,320
probably not a good idea cuz it can be a
 

3319
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:33,629
probably not a good idea cuz it can be a
gamble but um I find that yeah when I

like you know Solutions how we could do
 

3343
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:05,629
like you know Solutions how we could do
a 3D debut from home potentially and I

3344
01:26:05,629 --> 01:26:05,639
a 3D debut from home potentially and I
 

3345
01:26:05,639 --> 01:26:07,990
a 3D debut from home potentially and I
was like oh I'm really trying her best

3346
01:26:07,990 --> 01:26:08,000
was like oh I'm really trying her best
 

3347
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,870
was like oh I'm really trying her best
to make this work because I really at

3348
01:26:09,870 --> 01:26:09,880
to make this work because I really at
 

3349
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:11,629
to make this work because I really at
that point I was still hoping to just do

3350
01:26:11,629 --> 01:26:11,639
that point I was still hoping to just do
 

3351
01:26:11,639 --> 01:26:13,950
that point I was still hoping to just do
an early 3D deut like we've been waiting

3352
01:26:13,950 --> 01:26:13,960
an early 3D deut like we've been waiting
 

3353
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:18,189
an early 3D deut like we've been waiting
so long and you know I just love how you

3354
01:26:18,189 --> 01:26:18,199
so long and you know I just love how you
 

3355

so long and you know I just love how you
were always trying to make things work

for us and you were so cool like it was
 

3359
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:25,910
for us and you were so cool like it was
like oh my God she has so much techn

3360
01:26:25,910 --> 01:26:25,920
like oh my God she has so much techn
 

3361
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:28,590
like oh my God she has so much techn
knowledge yeah and some of those things

3362
01:26:28,590 --> 01:26:28,600
knowledge yeah and some of those things
 

3363
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:30,910
knowledge yeah and some of those things
like the the option that we thought

3364
01:26:30,910 --> 01:26:30,920
like the the option that we thought
 

3365
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:34,070
like the the option that we thought
about you thought about for using it

3366
01:26:34,070 --> 01:26:34,080
about you thought about for using it
 

3367
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:36,669
about you thought about for using it
potentially for a 3D debut at home we

3368
01:26:36,669 --> 01:26:36,679
potentially for a 3D debut at home we
 

3369
01:26:36,679 --> 01:26:39,149
potentially for a 3D debut at home we
didn't use it in the end but it became a

3370
01:26:39,149 --> 01:26:39,159
didn't use it in the end but it became a
 

3371
01:26:39,159 --> 01:26:42,070
didn't use it in the end but it became a
solution for home 3D for all of Ian at

3372
01:26:42,070 --> 01:26:42,080
solution for home 3D for all of Ian at
 

3373
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:46,790
solution for home 3D for all of Ian at
the time before M guys um right so every

3374
01:26:46,790 --> 01:26:46,800
the time before M guys um right so every
 

3375
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:48,629
the time before M guys um right so every
we can talk about that a littleit think

3376
01:26:48,629 --> 01:26:48,639
we can talk about that a littleit think
 

3377
01:26:48,639 --> 01:26:51,910
we can talk about that a littleit think
we can what the hell do it yeah yeah so

3378
01:26:51,910 --> 01:26:51,920
we can what the hell do it yeah yeah so
 

3379
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:54,030
we can what the hell do it yeah yeah so
it it was like a solution that I found

3380
01:26:54,030 --> 01:26:54,040
it it was like a solution that I found
 

3381
01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:55,510
it it was like a solution that I found
that I mean there were other YouTubers

3382
01:26:55,510 --> 01:26:55,520
that I mean there were other YouTubers
 

3383
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:56,669
that I mean there were other YouTubers
that were doing it so I was not the

3384
01:26:56,669 --> 01:26:56,679
that were doing it so I was not the
 

3385
01:26:56,679 --> 01:26:59,470
that were doing it so I was not the
first one but um I think the the company

3386
01:26:59,470 --> 01:26:59,480
first one but um I think the the company
 

3387
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:00,950
first one but um I think the the company
also took a little bit of a gamble in

3388
01:27:00,950 --> 01:27:00,960
also took a little bit of a gamble in
 

3389
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:02,709
also took a little bit of a gamble in
terms of investing and getting that

3390
01:27:02,709 --> 01:27:02,719
terms of investing and getting that
 

3391
01:27:02,719 --> 01:27:04,990
terms of investing and getting that
solution for everybody because it was

3392
01:27:04,990 --> 01:27:05,000
solution for everybody because it was
 

3393
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,109
solution for everybody because it was
something that I I had bought on my own

3394
01:27:07,109 --> 01:27:07,119
something that I I had bought on my own
 

3395
01:27:07,119 --> 01:27:09,990
something that I I had bought on my own
and I I would have like a meeting with

3396
01:27:09,990 --> 01:27:10,000
and I I would have like a meeting with
 

3397
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,030
and I I would have like a meeting with
some of the tech of the company like

3398
01:27:12,030 --> 01:27:12,040
some of the tech of the company like
 

3399
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:15,149
some of the tech of the company like
Tech uh people in the company and I was

3400
01:27:15,149 --> 01:27:15,159
Tech uh people in the company and I was
 

3401
01:27:15,159 --> 01:27:16,750
Tech uh people in the company and I was
like look we can use it like this we can

3402
01:27:16,750 --> 01:27:16,760
like look we can use it like this we can
 

3403
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:19,870
like look we can use it like this we can
send data like this and um yeah it

3404
01:27:19,870 --> 01:27:19,880
send data like this and um yeah it
 

3405
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:21,950
send data like this and um yeah it
pretty much showed them like how uh

3406
01:27:21,950 --> 01:27:21,960
pretty much showed them like how uh
 

3407
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:24,830
pretty much showed them like how uh
versatile it was and I think off of that

3408
01:27:24,830 --> 01:27:24,840
versatile it was and I think off of that
 

3409
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:27,350
versatile it was and I think off of that
they just invested in it for all of Ian

3410
01:27:27,350 --> 01:27:27,360
they just invested in it for all of Ian
 

3411
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:33,070
they just invested in it for all of Ian
that has 3D so yeah I I honestly don't

3412
01:27:33,070 --> 01:27:33,080
that has 3D so yeah I I honestly don't
 

3413
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:36,629
that has 3D so yeah I I honestly don't
think I don't think that the home

3414
01:27:36,629 --> 01:27:36,639
think I don't think that the home
 

3415
01:27:36,639 --> 01:27:41,030
think I don't think that the home
3D uh would have become a thing so early

3416
01:27:41,030 --> 01:27:41,040
3D uh would have become a thing so early
 

3417
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:43,229
3D uh would have become a thing so early
at least for any of us I I don't think

3418
01:27:43,229 --> 01:27:43,239
at least for any of us I I don't think
 

3419
01:27:43,239 --> 01:27:45,830
at least for any of us I I don't think
it would have been on cover's mind to

3420
01:27:45,830 --> 01:27:45,840
it would have been on cover's mind to
 

3421
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:48,870
it would have been on cover's mind to
provide us with home 3D especially the

3422
01:27:48,870 --> 01:27:48,880
provide us with home 3D especially the
 

3423
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:50,629
provide us with home 3D especially the
reason why we got it at the time was

3424
01:27:50,629 --> 01:27:50,639
reason why we got it at the time was
 

3425
01:27:50,639 --> 01:27:52,390
reason why we got it at the time was
because because of Corona we couldn't go

3426
01:27:52,390 --> 01:27:52,400
because because of Corona we couldn't go
 

3427
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:55,629
because because of Corona we couldn't go
to Japan and and even once we were able

3428
01:27:55,629 --> 01:27:55,639
to Japan and and even once we were able
 

3429
01:27:55,639 --> 01:27:58,709
to Japan and and even once we were able
to go to Japan we still just didn't have

3430
01:27:58,709 --> 01:27:58,719
to go to Japan we still just didn't have
 

3431
01:27:58,719 --> 01:28:00,790
to go to Japan we still just didn't have
as much opportunities to use the studio

3432
01:28:00,790 --> 01:28:00,800
as much opportunities to use the studio
 

3433
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:02,830
as much opportunities to use the studio
because we lived we live overseas or so

3434
01:28:02,830 --> 01:28:02,840
because we lived we live overseas or so
 

3435
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:05,430
because we lived we live overseas or so
mostly and the studio is fully booked or

3436
01:28:05,430 --> 01:28:05,440
mostly and the studio is fully booked or
 

3437
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:07,350
mostly and the studio is fully booked or
whatever so just to give us like more

3438
01:28:07,350 --> 01:28:07,360
whatever so just to give us like more
 

3439
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:10,910
whatever so just to give us like more
ways of doing things uh that was like

3440
01:28:10,910 --> 01:28:10,920
ways of doing things uh that was like
 

3441
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:12,709
ways of doing things uh that was like
really great that you had brought up

3442
01:28:12,709 --> 01:28:12,719
really great that you had brought up
 

3443

really great that you had brought up
these things and presented it to the

3444
01:28:15,750 --> 01:28:15,760
these things and presented it to the
 

3445
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:17,310
these things and presented it to the
management so it was on their mind and

3446
01:28:17,310 --> 01:28:17,320
management so it was on their mind and
 

3447
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:20,430
management so it was on their mind and
they were like you know okay maybe maybe

3448
01:28:20,430 --> 01:28:20,440
they were like you know okay maybe maybe
 

3449
01:28:20,440 --> 01:28:22,189
they were like you know okay maybe maybe
we should do this and they actually

3450
01:28:22,189 --> 01:28:22,199
we should do this and they actually
 

3451
01:28:22,199 --> 01:28:23,790
we should do this and they actually
considered it and made it a thing and

3452
01:28:23,790 --> 01:28:23,800
considered it and made it a thing and
 

3453
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:27,149
considered it and made it a thing and
bought the solution so yeah I think even

3454
01:28:27,149 --> 01:28:27,159
bought the solution so yeah I think even
 

3455
01:28:27,159 --> 01:28:29,709
bought the solution so yeah I think even
people oh yeah even people still use it

3456
01:28:29,709 --> 01:28:29,719
people oh yeah even people still use it
 

3457

uh yeah I think so for sure how so cuz
 

3837
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,149
uh yeah I think so for sure how so cuz
when we met each other we never got to

3838
01:39:14,149 --> 01:39:14,159
when we met each other we never got to
 

3839
01:39:14,159 --> 01:39:16,990
when we met each other we never got to
meet in person until like what after a

3840
01:39:16,990 --> 01:39:17,000
meet in person until like what after a
 

3841
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:18,470
meet in person until like what after a
few years of

3842
01:39:18,470 --> 01:39:18,480
few years of
 

3843
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:20,470
few years of
meeting and I think that's that's kind

3844
01:39:20,470 --> 01:39:20,480
meeting and I think that's that's kind
 

3845
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:22,750
meeting and I think that's that's kind
of interesting because we get to know

3846
01:39:22,750 --> 01:39:22,760
of interesting because we get to know
 

3847
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:25,430
of interesting because we get to know
each other onine online first and

3848
01:39:25,430 --> 01:39:25,440
each other onine online first and
 

3849
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:28,109
each other onine online first and
sometimes the way people are online

3850
01:39:28,109 --> 01:39:28,119
sometimes the way people are online
 

3851
01:39:28,119 --> 01:39:30,990
sometimes the way people are online
versus offline is like a little bit

3852
01:39:30,990 --> 01:39:31,000
versus offline is like a little bit
 

3853
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:34,189
versus offline is like a little bit
different but I feel like meeting each

3854
01:39:34,189 --> 01:39:34,199
different but I feel like meeting each
 

3855
01:39:34,199 --> 01:39:36,390
different but I feel like meeting each
other uh I don't know it just felt

3856
01:39:36,390 --> 01:39:36,400
other uh I don't know it just felt
 

3857
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:41,310
other uh I don't know it just felt
natural like how we usually are and um I

3858
01:39:41,310 --> 01:39:41,320
natural like how we usually are and um I
 

3859
01:39:41,320 --> 01:39:44,149
natural like how we usually are and um I
think a few of us are pretty low energy

3860
01:39:44,149 --> 01:39:44,159
think a few of us are pretty low energy
 

3861
01:39:44,159 --> 01:39:45,830
think a few of us are pretty low energy
so maybe it's hard for other people to

3862
01:39:45,830 --> 01:39:45,840
so maybe it's hard for other people to
 

3863
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:48,310
so maybe it's hard for other people to
tell that we're the type of people that

3864
01:39:48,310 --> 01:39:48,320
tell that we're the type of people that
 

3865
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:49,629
tell that we're the type of people that
it takes a while for us to get

3866
01:39:49,629 --> 01:39:49,639
it takes a while for us to get
 

3867
01:39:49,639 --> 01:39:52,270
it takes a while for us to get
comfortable with others but I think we

3868
01:39:52,270 --> 01:39:52,280
comfortable with others but I think we
 

3869
01:39:52,280 --> 01:39:54,870
comfortable with others but I think we
have already reach that point and Beyond

3870
01:39:54,870 --> 01:39:54,880
have already reach that point and Beyond
 

3871
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:57,149
have already reach that point and Beyond
where we could just hang out on a couch
