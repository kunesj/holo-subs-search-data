fish farm is a little bit more difficult

3654
01:32:31,990 --> 01:32:32,000
fish farm is a little bit more difficult
 

3655
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,709
fish farm is a little bit more difficult
uh to

3656
01:32:33,709 --> 01:32:33,719
uh to
 

3657
01:32:33,719 --> 01:32:37,950
uh to
access uh but it's more efficient so um

3658
01:32:37,950 --> 01:32:37,960
access uh but it's more efficient so um
 

3659
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:40,590
access uh but it's more efficient so um
if I I I normally just fly there but

3695
01:33:38,199 --> 01:33:41,149
needs I can't but it's it's very
efficient though are you okay yeah I was

3696
01:33:41,149 --> 01:33:41,159
efficient though are you okay yeah I was
 

3697
01:33:41,159 --> 01:33:42,990
efficient though are you okay yeah I was
stuck for some reason for a

3769
01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:30,030
know ah I know I know I know of a few
more things I just have to run around

3770
01:35:30,030 --> 01:35:30,040
more things I just have to run around
 

3771
01:35:30,040 --> 01:35:32,229
more things I just have to run around
and be lucky to find

3772
01:35:32,229 --> 01:35:32,239
and be lucky to find
 

3773
01:35:32,239 --> 01:35:35,790
and be lucky to find
them yeah bunk I was never you looked at

3774
01:35:35,790 --> 01:35:35,800
them yeah bunk I was never you looked at
 

3775
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:37,229

right you must die the good thing is he

3782
01:35:44,109 --> 01:35:44,119
right you must die the good thing is he
 

3783
01:35:44,119 --> 01:35:48,030
right you must die the good thing is he
can't go past that point uh yeah cuz a

3784
01:35:48,030 --> 01:35:48,040
can't go past that point uh yeah cuz a
 

3785
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:52,149
can't go past that point uh yeah cuz a
certain amount of um yeah uh oh nice an

3786
01:35:52,149 --> 01:35:52,159
certain amount of um yeah uh oh nice an
 

3787
01:35:52,159 --> 01:35:55,910
certain amount of um yeah uh oh nice an
ie the the blocks like he's too tall for

specific an man you know sometimes

3792
01:36:02,990 --> 01:36:03,000
specific an man you know sometimes
 

3793
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,390
specific an man you know sometimes
specific enemies are in specific

3794
01:36:05,390 --> 01:36:05,400
specific enemies are in specific
 

3795
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:07,350

location this will be a lesson for you

3796
01:36:07,350 --> 01:36:07,360
location this will be a lesson for you
 

3797
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:09,149
location this will be a lesson for you
basically for the future this was just

3798
01:36:09,149 --> 01:36:09,159
basically for the future this was just
 

3799
01:36:09,159 --> 01:36:11,590
basically for the future this was just
an experiment to show her for the future

3800
01:36:11,590 --> 01:36:11,600
an experiment to show her for the future
 

3801
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:15,149
an experiment to show her for the future
so she won't make these mistakes um so

3802
01:36:15,149 --> 01:36:15,159
so she won't make these mistakes um so
 

3803
01:36:15,159 --> 01:36:17,270
so she won't make these mistakes um so
sometimes specific enemies are in

3804
01:36:17,270 --> 01:36:17,280
sometimes specific enemies are in
 

3805
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:20,590
sometimes specific enemies are in
specific locations for a reason somebody

3806
01:36:20,590 --> 01:36:20,600
specific locations for a reason somebody
 

3807
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:24,550
specific locations for a reason somebody
may have C captured them there um to to

3808
01:36:24,550 --> 01:36:24,560
may have C captured them there um to to
 

3809
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:27,790
may have C captured them there um to to
be their pet or so um did you kill

3810
01:36:27,790 --> 01:36:27,800
be their pet or so um did you kill
 

3811
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:31,310
be their pet or so um did you kill
someone's pet apparently oh no it's fine

3812
01:36:31,310 --> 01:36:31,320
someone's pet apparently oh no it's fine
 

3813
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:33,950
someone's pet apparently oh no it's fine
let's let's run let's run he was Agro he

3814
01:36:33,950 --> 01:36:33,960
let's let's run let's run he was Agro he
 

3815
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:37,870
let's let's run let's run he was Agro he
was fine it's fine so yeah I think we

3816
01:36:37,870 --> 01:36:37,880
was fine it's fine so yeah I think we
 

3817
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:39,590
was fine it's fine so yeah I think we
should try to go go the other way

3818
01:36:39,590 --> 01:36:39,600
should try to go go the other way
 

3819
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:40,910
should try to go go the other way
actually might be

3820
01:36:40,910 --> 01:36:40,920
actually might be
 

3821
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:43,030
actually might be
shorter I think that's what the loop is

3822
01:36:43,030 --> 01:36:43,040
shorter I think that's what the loop is
 

3823
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:45,629
shorter I think that's what the loop is
for right I would think

3824
01:36:45,629 --> 01:36:45,639
for right I would think
 

3825
01:36:45,639 --> 01:36:48,669
for right I would think
so yeah so if you see like a zombie

3826
01:36:48,669 --> 01:36:48,679
so yeah so if you see like a zombie
 

3827
01:36:48,679 --> 01:36:51,510
so yeah so if you see like a zombie
somewhere where he shouldn't be chances

3828
01:36:51,510 --> 01:36:51,520
somewhere where he shouldn't be chances
 

3829
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:53,510
somewhere where he shouldn't be chances
hard at to

3830
01:36:53,510 --> 01:36:53,520
hard at to
 

3831
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:56,709
hard at to
well well you know how do I even there's

3832
01:36:56,709 --> 01:36:56,719
well well you know how do I even there's
 

3833
01:36:56,719 --> 01:36:58,149
well well you know how do I even there's
no button

3834
01:36:58,149 --> 01:36:58,159
no button
 

3835
01:36:58,159 --> 01:37:03,310
no button
here I'm going slowly and then fast how

3836
01:37:03,310 --> 01:37:03,320
here I'm going slowly and then fast how
 

3837
01:37:03,320 --> 01:37:04,350
here I'm going slowly and then fast how
do you

3838
01:37:04,350 --> 01:37:04,360
do you
 

3839
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:08,149
do you
move uh go like with the

3840
01:37:08,149 --> 01:37:08,159
move uh go like with the
 

3841
01:37:08,159 --> 01:37:12,950
move uh go like with the
w yeah that happens a lot it might stop

3842
01:37:12,950 --> 01:37:12,960
w yeah that happens a lot it might stop
 

3843
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:15,229
w yeah that happens a lot it might stop
eventually okay keep on running after it

3844
01:37:15,229 --> 01:37:15,239
eventually okay keep on running after it
 

3845
01:37:15,239 --> 01:37:18,910
eventually okay keep on running after it
I got it I got it

3846
01:37:18,910 --> 01:37:18,920

 

3847
01:37:18,920 --> 01:37:23,629

okay yeah um oh yeah okay chat is just

suffering yeah oh she did to protect me
 

3861
01:37:37,239 --> 01:37:40,910
suffering yeah oh she did to protect me
which means it was worth it a yeah kind

3862
01:37:40,910 --> 01:37:40,920
which means it was worth it a yeah kind
 

3863
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:43,990

3905
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:54,030
walks walks are okay I guess if they're
not too long I have another mine cart

3906
01:38:54,030 --> 01:38:54,040
not too long I have another mine cart
 

3907
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:56,229
not too long I have another mine cart
for some reason so if you found and

3908

picked mine up you
 

3911
01:38:57,880 --> 01:39:02,830
picked mine up you
can yeah I uh I I may have taken it um

3912

this this is this is the combined server

5762
02:24:00,190 --> 02:24:00,200
this this is this is the combined server
 

5763
02:24:00,200 --> 02:24:02,550
this this is this is the combined server
as far as I know I'm pretty sure the

5764
02:24:02,550 --> 02:24:02,560
as far as I know I'm pretty sure the
 

5765

as far as I know I'm pretty sure the
other one leads to the same to the same

5766
02:24:04,790 --> 02:24:04,800
other one leads to the same to the same
 

5767
02:24:04,800 --> 02:24:08,190
other one leads to the same to the same
one just like that the that leads to the

5768
02:24:08,190 --> 02:24:08,200
