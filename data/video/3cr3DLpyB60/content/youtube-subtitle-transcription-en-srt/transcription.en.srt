01:33:18,950 --> 01:33:18,960
at the edge of it hit hit the space bar
 

3459
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:20,310
at the edge of it hit hit the space bar
for the first time let me try it one

3460
01:33:20,310 --> 01:33:20,320
for the first time let me try it one
 

3461
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:22,470
for the first time let me try it one
more time maybe I can get it down to a

3462
01:33:22,470 --> 01:33:22,480
more time maybe I can get it down to a
 

3463
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:25,189
more time maybe I can get it down to a
science so the moment you're right

3464
01:33:25,189 --> 01:33:25,199
science so the moment you're right
 

3465
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:28,790
science so the moment you're right
here hit and then H I didn't

3466
01:33:28,790 --> 01:33:28,800
here hit and then H I didn't
 

3467
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:33,990
here hit and then H I didn't
get look up I feel like I look up Edge

maxing what yeah get get all the way
 

3471
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:38,230
maxing what yeah get get all the way
close to the

3472
01:33:38,230 --> 01:33:38,240
close to the
 

3473
01:33:38,240 --> 01:33:43,350

3475
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:45,750

edge you got to get as far to the edge

3476
01:33:45,750 --> 01:33:45,760
edge you got to get as far to the edge
 

3477
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:48,990
edge you got to get as far to the edge
as you can without falling then jump and

3478
01:33:48,990 --> 01:33:49,000
as you can without falling then jump and
 

3479
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,990
as you can without falling then jump and
then when you're kind of nearing The

3480

then when you're kind of nearing The
 

3481
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:55,030
then when you're kind of nearing The
Edge like hit the space bar again

3482
01:33:55,030 --> 01:33:55,040
Edge like hit the space bar again
 

3483
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:57,430
Edge like hit the space bar again
okay but wait you always try it from up

3484
01:33:57,430 --> 01:33:57,440
okay but wait you always try it from up
 

3485
01:33:57,440 --> 01:34:01,629
okay but wait you always try it from up
here maybe it's okay to do it from the

if it doesn't say efficiency free there
 

12299
05:23:46,520 --> 05:23:48,190

12331
05:24:25,958 --> 05:24:27,948
a level again but I would get Unbreaking
next oh my efficiency free though wait I

12332
05:24:27,948 --> 05:24:27,958
next oh my efficiency free though wait I
 

12333
05:24:27,958 --> 05:24:29,990
next oh my efficiency free though wait I
can get it oh it doesn't even take 30

12334
05:24:29,990 --> 05:24:30,000
can get it oh it doesn't even take 30
 

12335
