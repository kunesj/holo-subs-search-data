2591
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:33,229
think let's see like that's probably not
metal but there's some kind of like base

2592
01:14:33,229 --> 01:14:33,239
metal but there's some kind of like base
 

2593
01:14:33,239 --> 01:14:34,910
metal but there's some kind of like base
there

2594
01:14:34,910 --> 01:14:34,920
there
 

2595
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:39,649
there
so it's not oh oh it goes on smoothly

2596
01:14:39,649 --> 01:14:39,659
so it's not oh oh it goes on smoothly
 

2597
01:14:39,659 --> 01:14:43,030
so it's not oh oh it goes on smoothly
and that's actually easy

2598
01:14:43,030 --> 01:14:43,040
and that's actually easy
 

2599
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:46,640
and that's actually easy
okay so let's say

2600
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:46,650
okay so let's say
 

2601
01:14:46,650 --> 01:14:52,189

I mean usually I'm fine though
especially because on Sundays I have to

4638
02:10:28,490 --> 02:10:28,500
especially because on Sundays I have to
 

4639
02:10:28,500 --> 02:10:31,189
especially because on Sundays I have to
make my weekly schedule

4640
02:10:31,189 --> 02:10:31,199

one more thing though that I have to do

4646
02:10:36,350 --> 02:10:36,360
one more thing though that I have to do
 

4647
02:10:36,360 --> 02:10:38,689
one more thing though that I have to do
is I have to buy an advent calendar but

4648
02:10:38,689 --> 02:10:38,699
is I have to buy an advent calendar but
 

4649
02:10:38,699 --> 02:10:39,709
is I have to buy an advent calendar but
I guess

4650
02:10:39,709 --> 02:10:39,719
I guess
 

4651
02:10:39,719 --> 02:10:42,649
I guess
Advent calendar makes almost no sense

4652
02:10:42,649 --> 02:10:42,659
Advent calendar makes almost no sense
 

4653
02:10:42,659 --> 02:10:44,689

when you're an adult and

4654
02:10:44,689 --> 02:10:44,699
when you're an adult and
 

4655
02:10:44,699 --> 02:10:47,390
when you're an adult and
especially if you live alone I guess

4656
02:10:47,390 --> 02:10:47,400
especially if you live alone I guess
 

4657
02:10:47,400 --> 02:10:50,870
especially if you live alone I guess
because you know what's inside

4658
02:10:50,870 --> 02:10:50,880
because you know what's inside
 

4659

4661
02:10:52,760 --> 02:10:54,830
and
especially if it's a chocolate Advent

4662
02:10:54,830 --> 02:10:54,840
especially if it's a chocolate Advent
 

4663
02:10:54,840 --> 02:10:58,850
