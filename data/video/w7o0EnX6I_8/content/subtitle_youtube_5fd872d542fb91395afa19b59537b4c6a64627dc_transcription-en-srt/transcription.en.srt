tried out more stuff before but before
 

5273
02:52:29,239 --> 02:52:31,190
tried out more stuff before but before
it was going so well that I saw no

5274
02:52:31,190 --> 02:52:31,200
it was going so well that I saw no
 

5275
02:52:31,200 --> 02:52:34,150
it was going so well that I saw no
reason to switch and then during the

5276
02:52:34,150 --> 02:52:34,160
reason to switch and then during the
 

5277
02:52:34,160 --> 02:52:36,630
reason to switch and then during the
collab it was like N I don't really have

5278
02:52:36,630 --> 02:52:36,640
collab it was like N I don't really have
 

5279
02:52:36,640 --> 02:52:39,030
collab it was like N I don't really have
time to look at everything now so if I

5280
02:52:39,030 --> 02:52:39,040
time to look at everything now so if I
 

5281
02:52:39,040 --> 02:52:41,750
time to look at everything now so if I
switch then I won't know what I'm doing

5282
02:52:41,750 --> 02:52:41,760
switch then I won't know what I'm doing
 

5283
02:52:41,760 --> 02:52:43,630
switch then I won't know what I'm doing
but then eventually yeah I just switched

5284
02:52:43,630 --> 02:52:43,640
but then eventually yeah I just switched
 

5285
02:52:43,640 --> 02:52:54,110
but then eventually yeah I just switched
around and tried to wing it

5286
02:52:54,110 --> 02:52:54,120

 

5287
02:52:54,120 --> 02:52:58,630

yeah um and when I saw how like several

5288
02:52:58,630 --> 02:52:58,640
yeah um and when I saw how like several
 

5289
02:52:58,640 --> 02:53:00,830
yeah um and when I saw how like several
people were already playing that heavy

5290
02:53:00,830 --> 02:53:00,840
people were already playing that heavy
 

5291
02:53:00,840 --> 02:53:05,030
people were already playing that heavy
and were basically Invincible I was

5292
02:53:05,030 --> 02:53:05,040
and were basically Invincible I was
 

5293
02:53:05,040 --> 02:53:08,269
and were basically Invincible I was
like maybe I should play

5294
02:53:08,269 --> 02:53:08,279
like maybe I should play
 

5295
02:53:08,279 --> 02:53:11,790
like maybe I should play
that can only counter with more of those

5296
02:53:11,790 --> 02:53:11,800
that can only counter with more of those
 

5297
02:53:11,800 --> 02:53:15,030
that can only counter with more of those
heavy da guys right that's the

5298
02:53:15,030 --> 02:53:15,040
heavy da guys right that's the
 

5299
02:53:15,040 --> 02:53:17,590
heavy da guys right that's the
solution but apparently that was a real

5300
02:53:17,590 --> 02:53:17,600
solution but apparently that was a real
 

5301
02:53:17,600 --> 02:53:22,150
solution but apparently that was a real
strategy

5302
02:53:22,150 --> 02:53:22,160

 

5303
02:53:22,160 --> 02:53:25,309

yeah you say I was good at it but that

5304
02:53:25,309 --> 02:53:25,319
yeah you say I was good at it but that
 

5305
02:53:25,319 --> 02:53:29,150
yeah you say I was good at it but that
just seems like a really easy

5306
02:53:29,150 --> 02:53:29,160

 

5307
02:53:29,160 --> 02:53:36,620

class really no skill

5308
02:53:36,620 --> 02:53:36,630

necessary not really I don't

5312
02:53:52,780 --> 02:53:52,790

 

5313
02:53:52,790 --> 02:53:56,190

[Music]

5314
02:53:56,190 --> 02:53:56,200

 

5315
02:53:56,200 --> 02:53:58,710

know aiming is a

5316
02:53:58,710 --> 02:53:58,720
know aiming is a
 

5317
02:53:58,720 --> 02:54:01,710
know aiming is a
skill yeah I mean I will say I think I

5318
02:54:01,710 --> 02:54:01,720
skill yeah I mean I will say I think I
 

5319
02:54:01,720 --> 02:54:04,630
skill yeah I mean I will say I think I
aimed pretty well but with heavy when I

5320
02:54:04,630 --> 02:54:04,640
aimed pretty well but with heavy when I
 

5321
02:54:04,640 --> 02:54:06,870
aimed pretty well but with heavy when I
was playing heavy I wasn't moving around

5322
02:54:06,870 --> 02:54:06,880
was playing heavy I wasn't moving around
 

5323
02:54:06,880 --> 02:54:10,910
was playing heavy I wasn't moving around
much because I felt like a tank

5324
02:54:10,910 --> 02:54:10,920
much because I felt like a tank
 

5325
02:54:10,920 --> 02:54:13,550
much because I felt like a tank
so aiming was easier because there

5326
02:54:13,550 --> 02:54:13,560
so aiming was easier because there
 

5327
02:54:13,560 --> 02:54:15,710
so aiming was easier because there
wasn't as much movement on the field

5328
02:54:15,710 --> 02:54:15,720
wasn't as much movement on the field
 

5329
02:54:15,720 --> 02:54:18,190
wasn't as much movement on the field
both from me and from the opponents cuz

5330
02:54:18,190 --> 02:54:18,200
both from me and from the opponents cuz
 

5331
02:54:18,200 --> 02:54:20,990
both from me and from the opponents cuz
they were also Heavies a lot of

5332
02:54:20,990 --> 02:54:21,000
they were also Heavies a lot of
 

5333
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:24,389
they were also Heavies a lot of
them right so that automatically makes

5334
02:54:24,389 --> 02:54:24,399
them right so that automatically makes
 

5335
02:54:24,399 --> 02:54:25,750
them right so that automatically makes
it

5336
02:54:25,750 --> 02:54:25,760

uh the other day and I froze like three
 

7175
03:44:14,439 --> 03:44:16,309
uh the other day and I froze like three
portions

7176
03:44:16,309 --> 03:44:16,319
portions
 

7177
03:44:16,319 --> 03:44:20,229
portions
I already unfroze one yesterday but

7178
03:44:20,229 --> 03:44:20,239
I already unfroze one yesterday but
 

7179
03:44:20,239 --> 03:44:22,189
I already unfroze one yesterday but
turns out that Those portions are

7180
03:44:22,189 --> 03:44:22,199
turns out that Those portions are
 

7181
03:44:22,199 --> 03:44:24,429
turns out that Those portions are
basically two portions so it's basically

7182
03:44:24,429 --> 03:44:24,439
basically two portions so it's basically
 

7183
03:44:24,439 --> 03:44:27,550
basically two portions so it's basically
like six portions that I froze or maybe

7184
03:44:27,550 --> 03:44:27,560
like six portions that I froze or maybe
 

7185
03:44:27,560 --> 03:44:30,990
like six portions that I froze or maybe
like

7186
03:44:30,990 --> 03:44:31,000

 

7187
03:44:31,000 --> 03:44:32,750

five

7188
03:44:32,750 --> 03:44:32,760
five
 

7189
03:44:32,760 --> 03:44:36,590
five
yeah but I'm kind of feeling Basta today

7190
03:44:36,590 --> 03:44:36,600
yeah but I'm kind of feeling Basta today
 

7191
03:44:36,600 --> 03:44:39,030
yeah but I'm kind of feeling Basta today
so I think the

7192
03:44:39,030 --> 03:44:39,040
so I think the
 

7193
03:44:39,040 --> 03:44:41,389
so I think the
unfrozen chili that I now put into the

7194
03:44:41,389 --> 03:44:41,399
unfrozen chili that I now put into the
 

7195
03:44:41,399 --> 03:44:43,630
unfrozen chili that I now put into the
fridge could eat it

7196
03:44:43,630 --> 03:44:43,640
fridge could eat it
 

7197
03:44:43,640 --> 03:44:46,990
fridge could eat it
tomorrow or could eat it today then I

7198
