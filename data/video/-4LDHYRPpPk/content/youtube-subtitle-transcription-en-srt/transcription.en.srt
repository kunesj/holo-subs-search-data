that difficult cuz if we have all the
 

6363

that difficult cuz if we have all the
materials then surely there's a

6364

development at some point I guess maybe

7240
03:19:40,710 --> 03:19:40,720
development at some point I guess maybe
 

7241
03:19:40,720 --> 03:19:42,469
development at some point I guess maybe
because they took so much time that

7242
03:19:42,469 --> 03:19:42,479
because they took so much time that
 

7243
03:19:42,479 --> 03:19:44,189
because they took so much time that
everything was outdated at that point

with beds like I can make an extra
 

9419
04:13:58,800 --> 04:14:01,389
with beds like I can make an extra
amount of villagers and then we'll get

9420
04:14:01,389 --> 04:14:01,399
amount of villagers and then we'll get
 

9421
04:14:01,399 --> 04:14:03,790
amount of villagers and then we'll get
rid of the beds they will sense the beds

9422
04:14:03,790 --> 04:14:03,800
rid of the beds they will sense the beds
 

9423

04:14:08,950 --> 04:14:08,960
there and if we have uh like stairs then
 

9427
04:14:08,960 --> 04:14:11,870
there and if we have uh like stairs then
they walk up there themselves as long as

these do not look like the one that we

9862
04:24:34,469 --> 04:24:34,479
these do not look like the one that we
 

9863
04:24:34,479 --> 04:24:35,830
these do not look like the one that we
have in in our server which I guess

9864
04:24:35,830 --> 04:24:35,840
have in in our server which I guess
 

9865
04:24:35,840 --> 04:24:38,790
have in in our server which I guess
makes sense but yeah that one would be

9866
04:24:38,790 --> 04:24:38,800
makes sense but yeah that one would be
 

9867
04:24:38,800 --> 04:24:40,950
makes sense but yeah that one would be
different most likely I don't think we

9868
04:24:40,950 --> 04:24:40,960
different most likely I don't think we
 

9869
04:24:40,960 --> 04:24:43,630

can build that one nah not possible what

you have so far should still be viable

9872
04:24:45,349 --> 04:24:45,359
you have so far should still be viable
 

9873
04:24:45,359 --> 04:24:47,630
you have so far should still be viable
for other builds yeah probably it's not

9874
04:24:47,630 --> 04:24:47,640
for other builds yeah probably it's not
 

9875
04:24:47,640 --> 04:24:50,870

11164
04:56:40,470 --> 04:56:40,480

11165
04:56:40,480 --> 04:56:43,110
again don't take it away again
maybe we just got to wait for next year

11166
04:56:43,110 --> 04:56:43,120
maybe we just got to wait for next year
 

11167
04:56:43,120 --> 04:56:45,750
maybe we just got to wait for next year
but I think it's maybe it has I really

11168
04:56:45,750 --> 04:56:45,760
but I think it's maybe it has I really
 

11169
04:56:45,760 --> 04:56:47,390
but I think it's maybe it has I really
don't know the reasons but maybe it has

11170
04:56:47,390 --> 04:56:47,400
don't know the reasons but maybe it has
 

11171
04:56:47,400 --> 04:56:49,310
don't know the reasons but maybe it has
to do with the fact that you know the

11172
04:56:49,310 --> 04:56:49,320
to do with the fact that you know the
 

11173
04:56:49,320 --> 04:56:51,948
to do with the fact that you know the
studio is getting used a lot this summer

11174
04:56:51,948 --> 04:56:51,958
studio is getting used a lot this summer
 

11175
04:56:51,958 --> 04:56:55,270
studio is getting used a lot this summer
for all kinds of things oh yeah oh yeah

11176
04:56:55,270 --> 04:56:55,280
for all kinds of things oh yeah oh yeah
 

11177
04:56:55,280 --> 04:56:57,510
for all kinds of things oh yeah oh yeah
all kinds of project so maybe it was

11178
04:56:57,510 --> 04:56:57,520
all kinds of project so maybe it was
 

11179
04:56:57,520 --> 04:57:00,230
all kinds of project so maybe it was
really a choice of availability and in

11180
04:57:00,230 --> 04:57:00,240
really a choice of availability and in
 

11181
04:57:00,240 --> 04:57:01,990
really a choice of availability and in
that case I think it was the right

11182
04:57:01,990 --> 04:57:02,000
that case I think it was the right
 

11183
04:57:02,000 --> 04:57:05,548
that case I think it was the right
decision um you know to let yeah I think

11184
04:57:05,548 --> 04:57:05,558
decision um you know to let yeah I think
 

11185
04:57:05,558 --> 04:57:07,868
decision um you know to let yeah I think
so us do these other uh projects that

11186
04:57:07,868 --> 04:57:07,878
so us do these other uh projects that
 

11187
04:57:07,878 --> 04:57:09,750
so us do these other uh projects that
need to be done anyway like 3D debuts

11188
04:57:09,750 --> 04:57:09,760
need to be done anyway like 3D debuts
 

11189
04:57:09,760 --> 04:57:12,150
need to be done anyway like 3D debuts
for example you know don't want to delay

11190
04:57:12,150 --> 04:57:12,160
for example you know don't want to delay
 

11191
04:57:12,160 --> 04:57:14,910
for example you know don't want to delay
that for the sake of whole life summer

11192
04:57:14,910 --> 04:57:14,920
that for the sake of whole life summer
 

11193
04:57:14,920 --> 04:57:17,948
that for the sake of whole life summer
now I don't know depends on the person

11194
04:57:17,948 --> 04:57:17,958
now I don't know depends on the person
 

11195
04:57:17,958 --> 04:57:19,670
now I don't know depends on the person
but like cuz we had to deal with so many

11196
04:57:19,670 --> 04:57:19,680
but like cuz we had to deal with so many
 

11197
04:57:19,680 --> 04:57:21,628

11199
04:57:21,638 --> 04:57:23,110

nine
 

11379
05:01:43,280 --> 05:01:46,670
nine
yeah that's a lot got to spend iron to

11380
05:01:46,670 --> 05:01:46,680
yeah that's a lot got to spend iron to
 

11381
05:01:46,680 --> 05:01:50,190
yeah that's a lot got to spend iron to
make iron I guess hippity hoppity it

11382
05:01:50,190 --> 05:01:50,200
make iron I guess hippity hoppity it
 

11383
05:01:50,200 --> 05:01:53,910
make iron I guess hippity hoppity it
better not explode Hopper okay we need I

11384
05:01:53,910 --> 05:01:53,920
better not explode Hopper okay we need I
 

11385
05:01:53,920 --> 05:01:57,510
better not explode Hopper okay we need I
got my torches I'll light it up that's a

11386
05:01:57,510 --> 05:01:57,520
got my torches I'll light it up that's a
 

11387
05:01:57,520 --> 05:02:00,310
got my torches I'll light it up that's a
okay that's that's a lot of iron um you

11388
05:02:00,310 --> 05:02:00,320
okay that's that's a lot of iron um you
 

11389
05:02:00,320 --> 05:02:02,350
okay that's that's a lot of iron um you
might not be able to make all of them

11390
05:02:02,350 --> 05:02:02,360
might not be able to make all of them
 

11391
05:02:02,360 --> 05:02:05,270
might not be able to make all of them
right away cuz we have 17 now and one

11392
05:02:05,270 --> 05:02:05,280
right away cuz we have 17 now and one
 

11393
05:02:05,280 --> 05:02:06,868
right away cuz we have 17 now and one
hopper

11394
05:02:06,868 --> 05:02:06,878
hopper
 

11395
05:02:06,878 --> 05:02:10,628
hopper
needs five one hopper needs five

11396
05:02:10,628 --> 05:02:10,638
needs five one hopper needs five
 

11397
05:02:10,638 --> 05:02:13,270
needs five one hopper needs five
uh so you can make three right

11398
05:02:13,270 --> 05:02:13,280
uh so you can make three right
 

11399
05:02:13,280 --> 05:02:16,270
uh so you can make three right
now okay I can make three

11400
05:02:16,270 --> 05:02:16,280
now okay I can make three
 

11401
05:02:16,280 --> 05:02:19,990
now okay I can make three
Hoppers maybe may be difficult to finish

11402
05:02:19,990 --> 05:02:20,000
Hoppers maybe may be difficult to finish
 

11403
05:02:20,000 --> 05:02:23,628
Hoppers maybe may be difficult to finish
this project today not sure yeah with

11404
05:02:23,628 --> 05:02:23,638
this project today not sure yeah with
 

11405
05:02:23,638 --> 05:02:26,390
this project today not sure yeah with
that many Hoppers might need to make it

11406
05:02:26,390 --> 05:02:26,400
that many Hoppers might need to make it
 

11407
05:02:26,400 --> 05:02:28,190
that many Hoppers might need to make it
um should only need one

11408
05:02:28,190 --> 05:02:28,200
um should only need one
 

11409
05:02:28,200 --> 05:02:31,190
um should only need one
hopper it says nine though it says nine

in or only need four I guess there's
 

11413
05:02:33,240 --> 05:02:38,070
in or only need four I guess there's
several different versions you

11414
05:02:38,070 --> 05:02:38,080

 

11415
05:02:38,080 --> 05:02:42,590

know just bottles has nine so that's a

11416
05:02:42,590 --> 05:02:42,600
know just bottles has nine so that's a
 

11417
05:02:42,600 --> 05:02:43,948
know just bottles has nine so that's a
big

11421
05:02:47,280 --> 05:02:49,030
one botles has nine we don't yeah we
probably don't need such a nine is for

11422
05:02:49,030 --> 05:02:49,040
probably don't need such a nine is for
 

11423
05:02:49,040 --> 05:02:51,590

can place it at the end then I'm not
 

11439
05:03:12,040 --> 05:03:13,110
can place it at the end then I'm not
going to worry about The Hoppers I'll

11440
05:03:13,110 --> 05:03:13,120
going to worry about The Hoppers I'll
 

11441
