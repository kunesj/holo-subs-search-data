151
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,309
so honestly by the time i was done with
character creation i felt like in some

152
00:07:12,309 --> 00:07:12,319
character creation i felt like in some
 

153
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,950
character creation i felt like in some
way i was ready to quit the game at that

154
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:14,960

157
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,270
point but i would have felt like sorry
to end it there because there was no

158
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:19,280
to end it there because there was no
 

159
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,469
to end it there because there was no
gameplay yet that's why i decided to add

160
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:22,479
gameplay yet that's why i decided to add
 

161
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,230
gameplay yet that's why i decided to add
another hour to it

162
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:24,240
another hour to it
 

163
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,629
another hour to it
in order to you know provide some kind

164
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:26,639
in order to you know provide some kind
 

165
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,150
in order to you know provide some kind
of gameplay otherwise it was literally

166
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:28,160
of gameplay otherwise it was literally
 

167
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,670
of gameplay otherwise it was literally
just character creation what the hell

168
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:31,680
just character creation what the hell
 

169
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,670
just character creation what the hell
so that's why it ended up being a little

170
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:33,680
so that's why it ended up being a little
 

171
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,029
so that's why it ended up being a little
bit longer

172
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:37,039

could take a long time because
 

6097
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:35,429
