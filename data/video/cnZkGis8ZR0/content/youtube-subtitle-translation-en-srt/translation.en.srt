1453
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,109

bad for losing so much Natsuki-chan, I feel bad

was thinking of doubling the points, but

1459
00:55:58,510 --> 00:55:58,520
was thinking of doubling the points, but
 

1460
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:02,150
was thinking of doubling the points, but
then I heard a voice from heaven telling me that I was sure to be punished for being such a loser.

1461
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:04,670
then I heard a voice from heaven telling me that I was sure to be punished for being such a loser.
 

1462
00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:04,680

 

1463
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,190

1471
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:23,950
whether I win or lose, you're still the loser.
If I win, there won't be 100 million cases.

1472
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:23,960
If I win, there won't be 100 million cases.

foot pressure point mat.  Nema: It's

1495
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:04,720
foot pressure point mat.  Nema: It's
 

1496
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:07,309
foot pressure point mat.  Nema: It's
boring to just stand on foot pressure points,

1497

boring to just stand on foot pressure points,
 

1498
00:57:07,319 --> 00:57:09,789
boring to just stand on foot pressure points,

1500
00:57:09,799 --> 00:57:12,390
