first asked who like uh fought with wiow
before and in that group it was only me

and Ena
 

4041
02:10:22,360 --> 02:10:24,950
and Ena
and then later uh like we told her we

4042
02:10:24,950 --> 02:10:24,960
and then later uh like we told her we
 

4043
02:10:24,960 --> 02:10:26,709
and then later uh like we told her we
fought it outside and we fought it only

4044
02:10:26,709 --> 02:10:26,719
fought it outside and we fought it only
 

4045
02:10:26,719 --> 02:10:29,390
fought it outside and we fought it only
with five people and

4046
02:10:29,390 --> 02:10:29,400
with five people and
 

4047
02:10:29,400 --> 02:10:32,549
with five people and
even and even then it wasn't so

4048
02:10:32,549 --> 02:10:32,559
even and even then it wasn't so
 

4049
02:10:32,559 --> 02:10:34,589
even and even then it wasn't so
difficult but I guess with like they

4050
02:10:34,589 --> 02:10:34,599
difficult but I guess with like they
 

4051
02:10:34,599 --> 02:10:36,750
difficult but I guess with like they
have I didn't know that was different

4052
02:10:36,750 --> 02:10:36,760
have I didn't know that was different
 

4053
02:10:36,760 --> 02:10:40,350
have I didn't know that was different
difficulties um so yeah of course it's

4054
02:10:40,350 --> 02:10:40,360
difficulties um so yeah of course it's
 

4055
02:10:40,360 --> 02:10:41,870
difficulties um so yeah of course it's
going to be a bit more difficult then I

4056
02:10:41,870 --> 02:10:41,880
going to be a bit more difficult then I
 

4057
02:10:41,880 --> 02:10:43,870
going to be a bit more difficult then I
guess but we're also more people now and

4058
02:10:43,870 --> 02:10:43,880
guess but we're also more people now and
 

4059
02:10:43,880 --> 02:10:46,470
guess but we're also more people now and
also we didn't have never ride back then

4060
02:10:46,470 --> 02:10:46,480
also we didn't have never ride back then
 

4061
02:10:46,480 --> 02:10:48,510
also we didn't have never ride back then
and now a lot of us have never right I

4062
02:10:48,510 --> 02:10:48,520
and now a lot of us have never right I
