tasks well it's been too long they added
 

523
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:53,110
tasks well it's been too long they added
or something right like you can do stuff

00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:53,120
or something right like you can do stuff
 

525
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,470
or something right like you can do stuff
now or

526
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:54,480
now or
 

527
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,029
now or
something like rolls or something r oh

528
00:18:59,029 --> 00:18:59,039
something like rolls or something r oh
 

529
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,470
something like rolls or something r oh
yeah wasn't there something besides

530
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:00,480
yeah wasn't there something besides
 

531
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,909
yeah wasn't there something besides
crewmate now like um uh like besides

532
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:04,919
crewmate now like um uh like besides
 

533
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:06,870
crewmate now like um uh like besides
imposter like the Spy or something like

534
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:06,880
imposter like the Spy or something like
 

535
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,310
imposter like the Spy or something like
that

536
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:12,320

 

537
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,510

not that's I don't know how does that

538
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:15,520
not that's I don't know how does that
 

539
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,950
not that's I don't know how does that
work though I don't rul for that one at

540
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:17,960
work though I don't rul for that one at
 

541
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:21,590
work though I don't rul for that one at
the beginning so yeah there's four rols

542
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:21,600
the beginning so yeah there's four rols
 

543
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,830
the beginning so yeah there's four rols
there I don't know you girls can

544
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:22,840
there I don't know you girls can
 

545
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,870
there I don't know you girls can
probably see them in the settings uh on

546
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:24,880
probably see them in the settings uh on
 

547
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,630
probably see them in the settings uh on
the on the computer here there's a

548
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:26,640
the on the computer here there's a
 

549
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,029
the on the computer here there's a
scientist who can access a portable

550
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:29,039
scientist who can access a portable
 

551
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,990
scientist who can access a portable
vitals panel so they can check at any

552
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:31,000
vitals panel so they can check at any
 

553
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,750
vitals panel so they can check at any
point of time if there's somebody dead

554
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:33,760
point of time if there's somebody dead
 

555
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,590
point of time if there's somebody dead
so they always see the status of the

556
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:35,600
so they always see the status of the
 

557
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,870
so they always see the status of the
crew and then there's an engineer who

558
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:38,880
crew and then there's an engineer who
 

559
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,470
crew and then there's an engineer who
can use the vents even though they're

560
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:40,480
can use the vents even though they're
 

561
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,190
can use the vents even though they're
not an impostor but then you might be

562
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:42,200
not an impostor but then you might be
 

563
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,149
not an impostor but then you might be
sused and you have to be like I'm not

564
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:44,159
sused and you have to be like I'm not
 

565
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:46,190
sused and you have to be like I'm not
the Imposter I just vent because I can

566
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:46,200
the Imposter I just vent because I can
 

567
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,190
the Imposter I just vent because I can
oh that's pretty cool really and then

568
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:49,200
oh that's pretty cool really and then
 

569
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,750
oh that's pretty cool really and then
the guardian angel uh is the ghost of

570
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:51,760
the guardian angel uh is the ghost of
 

571
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,750
the guardian angel uh is the ghost of
the very first one of us that

572
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:54,760
the very first one of us that
 

573
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,950
the very first one of us that
dies oh is that how it works the first

574
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:56,960
dies oh is that how it works the first
 

575
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,789
dies oh is that how it works the first
person that dies is something like that

576
00:19:58,789 --> 00:19:58,799
person that dies is something like that
 

577
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,510
person that dies is something like that
the garden it say the g Angel is the

578
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:00,520
the garden it say the g Angel is the
 

579
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,270
the garden it say the g Angel is the
ghost of the first Dead crewmate they

580
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:02,280
ghost of the first Dead crewmate they
 

581
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,630
ghost of the first Dead crewmate they
can temporarily shield and protect other

582
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:04,640
can temporarily shield and protect other
 

583
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,710
can temporarily shield and protect other
living crew mates so I guess if you're

584
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:06,720
living crew mates so I guess if you're
 

585
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,590
living crew mates so I guess if you're
the first one that dies you become the

586
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:08,600
the first one that dies you become the
 

587
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,669
the first one that dies you become the
guardian angel and then you can protect

588
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:10,679
guardian angel and then you can protect
 

589
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:13,990
guardian angel and then you can protect
somebody else so that they don't die

590
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:14,000
somebody else so that they don't die
 

591
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,750
somebody else so that they don't die
yeah if you do it properly and well

592
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:16,760
yeah if you do it properly and well
 

593
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,950
yeah if you do it properly and well
timed you'll be able to prevent

594
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:17,960
timed you'll be able to prevent
 

595
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,430
timed you'll be able to prevent
imposters from killing their victims

596
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:19,440
imposters from killing their victims
 

597
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,190
imposters from killing their victims
sounds amazing me throwing so that I can

598
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:22,200
sounds amazing me throwing so that I can
 

599
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,830
sounds amazing me throwing so that I can

wow and then there's a shape shifter who

606
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:31,760
wow and then there's a shape shifter who
 

607
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,750
wow and then there's a shape shifter who
can who can change the appearance and

disguise themselves as other crew mates
 

611
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,830
disguise themselves as other crew mates
Shape Shifter why would you do that

612
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:37,840
Shape Shifter why would you do that
 

613
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,909
Shape Shifter why would you do that
though that just confuses everyone it's

614
00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:39,919
though that just confuses everyone it's
 

615
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,510
though that just confuses everyone it's
just Mak imposter or they're not even

616
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:44,520
just Mak imposter or they're not even
 

617
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,590
just Mak imposter or they're not even
harder to find too because then you know

harder to find too because then you know
 

619
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,510
harder to find too because then you know
the Imposter can say I'm the engineer oh

620
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:48,520
the Imposter can say I'm the engineer oh
 

621
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,230
the Imposter can say I'm the engineer oh
no I'm the shape you know like please I

so wait does only one impostor is only
 

639
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,149
so wait does only one impostor is only
one impostor The Shape Shifter is that

640
00:21:20,149 --> 00:21:20,159
one impostor The Shape Shifter is that
 

641
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,430
one impostor The Shape Shifter is that
how it works uh I can set how many there

642
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:22,440
how it works uh I can set how many there
 

643
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,830
how it works uh I can set how many there
will be I can say

644
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:24,840
will be I can say
 

645
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,390
will be I can say
two I can say we want two or I can say

646
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:27,400
two I can say we want two or I can say
 

647
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,470
two I can say we want two or I can say
we I want uh one or zero I can set it in

648
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:30,480
we I want uh one or zero I can set it in
 

649
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,029
we I want uh one or zero I can set it in
the

650
00:21:32,029 --> 00:21:32,039
the
 

651
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:34,830
the
settings but if I do one then only one

652
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:34,840
settings but if I do one then only one
 

653
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,310
settings but if I do one then only one
of the uh imposters will be Shape

654
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:37,320
of the uh imposters will be Shape
 

655
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,269
of the uh imposters will be Shape
Shifter but only 50% chance the one will

656
00:21:40,269 --> 00:21:40,279
Shifter but only 50% chance the one will
 

657
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:42,950
Shifter but only 50% chance the one will
be oh yeah I can I can make it higher

658
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:42,960
