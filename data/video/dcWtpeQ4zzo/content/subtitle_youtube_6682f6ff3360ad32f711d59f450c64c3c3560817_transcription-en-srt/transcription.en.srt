00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,390
um it's just how I how I say it I guess
but like yeah so because if you draw it

1782
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:14,400
but like yeah so because if you draw it
 

1783
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,130
but like yeah so because if you draw it
correctly then you will most of the time

1784
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:16,140
correctly then you will most of the time
 

1785
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,109
