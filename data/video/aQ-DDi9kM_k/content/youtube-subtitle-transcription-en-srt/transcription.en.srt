and one white dot and one red triangle
 

961
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,269
and one white dot and one red triangle
that is probably me

962
00:23:47,269 --> 00:23:47,279

 

963
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,230

oh i think this one is difficult should

964
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:50,240
oh i think this one is difficult should
 

965
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,149
oh i think this one is difficult should
i tell you where the green circled ones

966
00:23:52,149 --> 00:23:52,159
i tell you where the green circled ones
 

967
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,390
i tell you where the green circled ones
are or where the whites yes where are

should be two
so you are the triangle and then there

974
00:23:59,590 --> 00:23:59,600
so you are the triangle and then there
 

975
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,430
so you are the triangle and then there
should be two like circle things on the

976
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:01,440
should be two like circle things on the
 

977
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,909
should be two like circle things on the
map right yeah okay can you please tell

978
