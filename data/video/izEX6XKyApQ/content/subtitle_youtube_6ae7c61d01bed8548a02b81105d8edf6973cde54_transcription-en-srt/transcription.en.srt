5369
02:26:40,840 --> 02:26:43,469

one okay try to do the same pattern at

5370
02:26:43,469 --> 02:26:43,479
one okay try to do the same pattern at
 

5371
02:26:43,479 --> 02:26:45,550
one okay try to do the same pattern at
the opposite yeah let's try actually can

5372
02:26:45,550 --> 02:26:45,560
the opposite yeah let's try actually can
 

5373
02:26:45,560 --> 02:26:50,269
the opposite yeah let's try actually can
you tell me actually okay let me see we

5374

you you can do it it's okay okay let me
 

5383
02:27:02,240 --> 02:27:05,389
you you can do it it's okay okay let me
check this poter actually let's try to

5384
02:27:05,389 --> 02:27:05,399
check this poter actually let's try to
 

5385
02:27:05,399 --> 02:27:07,870
check this poter actually let's try to
understand the logic of a puzzle like

5386
02:27:07,870 --> 02:27:07,880
understand the logic of a puzzle like
 

5387
02:27:07,880 --> 02:27:11,830
understand the logic of a puzzle like
this so I mean there's like I don't know

5388
02:27:11,830 --> 02:27:11,840
this so I mean there's like I don't know
 

5389
02:27:11,840 --> 02:27:13,870
this so I mean there's like I don't know
if there's a simpler way of just like

5390
02:27:13,870 --> 02:27:13,880
if there's a simpler way of just like
 

5391
02:27:13,880 --> 02:27:16,469
if there's a simpler way of just like
being like Oh you clicking see oh you're

5392
02:27:16,469 --> 02:27:16,479
being like Oh you clicking see oh you're
 

5393
02:27:16,479 --> 02:27:18,590
being like Oh you clicking see oh you're
clicking again okay you can click then

02:27:18,590 --> 02:27:18,600
clicking again okay you can click then
 

5395
02:27:18,600 --> 02:27:20,670
clicking again okay you can click then
okay let's do together I can click yeah

5396
02:27:20,670 --> 02:27:20,680
okay let's do together I can click yeah
 

5397
02:27:20,680 --> 02:27:23,790
okay let's do together I can click yeah
yeah let's do

5398
02:27:23,790 --> 02:27:23,800
yeah let's do
 

5399
02:27:23,800 --> 02:27:27,349
yeah let's do
together oh I can't cck almost almost

5400
02:27:27,349 --> 02:27:27,359
together oh I can't cck almost almost
 

5401
02:27:27,359 --> 02:27:31,150
together oh I can't cck almost almost
almost interesting you I can't cck

5402
02:27:31,150 --> 02:27:31,160
almost interesting you I can't cck
 

5403
02:27:31,160 --> 02:27:33,990
almost interesting you I can't cck
anymore yeah it looks

5404
02:27:33,990 --> 02:27:34,000
anymore yeah it looks
 

5405
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,389
anymore yeah it looks
good yeah looks

good okay
 

5409
02:27:39,520 --> 02:27:45,630
good okay
no okay now I I I got an idea

5410
02:27:45,630 --> 02:27:45,640

 

5411
02:27:45,640 --> 02:27:48,710

02:27:48,710 --> 02:27:48,720
oops she can do
 

5413
02:27:48,720 --> 02:27:55,070
oops she can do
it h adjacent blocks adjacent

5414
02:27:55,070 --> 02:27:55,080

 

5415
02:27:55,080 --> 02:27:57,150

nice nice you got this one oh wait H you

5420
02:28:05,510 --> 02:28:05,520
nice nice you got this one oh wait H you
 

5421
02:28:05,520 --> 02:28:08,309
nice nice you got this one oh wait H you
had this size

5422
02:28:08,309 --> 02:28:08,319
had this size
 

5423
02:28:08,319 --> 02:28:11,389
had this size
oh how that works I really don't get the

5424
02:28:11,389 --> 02:28:11,399
oh how that works I really don't get the
 

5425
02:28:11,399 --> 02:28:13,630
oh how that works I really don't get the
logic of this

5426
02:28:13,630 --> 02:28:13,640
logic of this
 

5427
02:28:13,640 --> 02:28:17,670

5443
02:28:35,640 --> 02:28:37,429
it the most yeah yeah probably a bag but
it's probably better than all four of us

5444
02:28:37,429 --> 02:28:37,439
it's probably better than all four of us
 

5445
02:28:37,439 --> 02:28:39,710

doing it at the same time so that is

5446
02:28:39,710 --> 02:28:39,720
doing it at the same time so that is
 

5447
02:28:39,720 --> 02:28:41,429
doing it at the same time so that is
yeah but the way to do it is like you

5448
02:28:41,429 --> 02:28:41,439
yeah but the way to do it is like you
 

5449
02:28:41,439 --> 02:28:44,469
yeah but the way to do it is like you
just keep track of like what each like

just keep track of like what each like
 

5451
02:28:44,479 --> 02:28:46,309
just keep track of like what each like
when you the block what it

5452
02:28:46,309 --> 02:28:46,319
when you the block what it
 

5453
02:28:46,319 --> 02:28:48,670
when you the block what it
fills but you just got to be mindful of

5454
02:28:48,670 --> 02:28:48,680
fills but you just got to be mindful of
 

5455
02:28:48,680 --> 02:28:50,469
fills but you just got to be mindful of
the ones that are on the side cuz it'll

03:10:36,710 --> 03:10:36,720
maybe did you choose some blocks already
 

7089
03:10:36,720 --> 03:10:39,070
maybe did you choose some blocks already
no what should I use what maybe the

7090
03:10:39,070 --> 03:10:39,080
no what should I use what maybe the
 

7091
03:10:39,080 --> 03:10:43,309
no what should I use what maybe the
Terra Cotta or or yeah the bricks yeah

7092
03:10:43,309 --> 03:10:43,319
Terra Cotta or or yeah the bricks yeah
 

7093
03:10:43,319 --> 03:10:46,030
Terra Cotta or or yeah the bricks yeah
the bricks I was looking at them too I

7094
03:10:46,030 --> 03:10:46,040
the bricks I was looking at them too I
 

7095
03:10:46,040 --> 03:10:48,469
the bricks I was looking at them too I
got the bricks okay okay oh we only got

7096
03:10:48,469 --> 03:10:48,479
got the bricks okay okay oh we only got
 

7097
03:10:48,479 --> 03:10:53,910
got the bricks okay okay oh we only got
the bricks oh well okay I mean better

7098
03:10:53,910 --> 03:10:53,920
the bricks oh well okay I mean better
 

7099
03:10:53,920 --> 03:10:56,110
the bricks oh well okay I mean better
than nothing the thing is the other two

7100
03:10:56,110 --> 03:10:56,120
than nothing the thing is the other two
 

7101
03:10:56,120 --> 03:11:02,990
than nothing the thing is the other two
can also still get blocks yeah

7102
03:11:02,990 --> 03:11:03,000

 

7103
03:11:03,000 --> 03:11:05,670

no bricks I didn't wait I can probably

7104
03:11:05,670 --> 03:11:05,680
no bricks I didn't wait I can probably
 

7105
03:11:05,680 --> 03:11:08,750
no bricks I didn't wait I can probably
abandon the quest and then redo it right

7106
03:11:08,750 --> 03:11:08,760
abandon the quest and then redo it right
 

7107
03:11:08,760 --> 03:11:11,190
abandon the quest and then redo it right
no wait no let me do that I think

7108
03:11:11,190 --> 03:11:11,200
no wait no let me do that I think
 

7109
03:11:11,200 --> 03:11:12,830
no wait no let me do that I think
there's another like we can just get

7110
03:11:12,830 --> 03:11:12,840
there's another like we can just get
 

7111
03:11:12,840 --> 03:11:15,229
there's another like we can just get
more in the future maybe okay yeah the

7112
03:11:15,229 --> 03:11:15,239
more in the future maybe okay yeah the
 

7113
03:11:15,239 --> 03:11:16,870
more in the future maybe okay yeah the
other two can still we can build the

7114
03:11:16,870 --> 03:11:16,880
other two can still we can build the
 

7115
03:11:16,880 --> 03:11:18,510
other two can still we can build the
base the bricks we can make something

7116
03:11:18,510 --> 03:11:18,520
base the bricks we can make something
 

7117
03:11:18,520 --> 03:11:22,349
base the bricks we can make something
really big now and then they can add

7118
03:11:22,349 --> 03:11:22,359
really big now and then they can add
 

7119
03:11:22,359 --> 03:11:25,150
really big now and then they can add
like Windows and lights and

7120
03:11:25,150 --> 03:11:25,160
like Windows and lights and
 

7121
03:11:25,160 --> 03:11:28,630
like Windows and lights and
everything 120 blocks is actually not

7122
03:11:28,630 --> 03:11:28,640
everything 120 blocks is actually not
 

7123
03:11:28,640 --> 03:11:32,630
everything 120 blocks is actually not
much yeah that's why we need more this

7124
03:11:32,630 --> 03:11:32,640
much yeah that's why we need more this
 

7125
03:11:32,640 --> 03:11:34,590
much yeah that's why we need more this
is fine let's start to build here you

7126

is fine let's start to build here you
 

7127
03:11:34,600 --> 03:11:37,030
is fine let's start to build here you
want to do that can but can we make

7128
03:11:37,030 --> 03:11:37,040
want to do that can but can we make
 

7129
03:11:37,040 --> 03:11:39,309
