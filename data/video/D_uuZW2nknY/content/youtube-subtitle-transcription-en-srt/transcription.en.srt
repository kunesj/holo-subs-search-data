right and then drift potential hell yeah
 

815
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,350
right and then drift potential hell yeah
it looks like it could I don't actually

816
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:10,360
it looks like it could I don't actually
 

817

853
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:05,070
it can play a EUR bead and it will play
it nicely yes steel potential I don't

854
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:05,080
it nicely yes steel potential I don't
 

855
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,590
it nicely yes steel potential I don't
I'm going to be real I don't think

856
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:06,600
I'm going to be real I don't think
 

857
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,470
I'm going to be real I don't think
anyone would steal this car unless they

858
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:08,480
anyone would steal this car unless they
 

859
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,110
anyone would steal this car unless they
were a kop Mori fan I think they'd see

then if you steal it like people would

866
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:19,080
then if you steal it like people would
 

867
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,549
then if you steal it like people would
find it easily yeah yeah yeah so I don't

find it easily yeah yeah yeah so I don't
I think I think it's great cuz no one's

870
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:23,360
I think I think it's great cuz no one's

yeah so I'm still not sure is that a

874
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:27,039
yeah so I'm still not sure is that a
 

875
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,230
yeah so I'm still not sure is that a
plus or a minus like guess in this case

876
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:29,240
plus or a minus like guess in this case
 

877
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,909
plus or a minus like guess in this case
if no one's going to steal it it's a

878
00:22:30,909 --> 00:22:30,919
if no one's going to steal it it's a
 

879
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:34,310
if no one's going to steal it it's a
plus this is before before you said uh

880
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:34,320
plus this is before before you said uh
 

881
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,510
plus this is before before you said uh
steal ability is positive because people

882
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:36,520
steal ability is positive because people
 

883
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,870
steal ability is positive because people
like it so much that they would steal it

884
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:38,880
like it so much that they would steal it
 

885
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,230

00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:41,240
wait before you said it's positive now
 

887
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,909
wait before you said it's positive now
you're saying the fact that nobody would

888

889
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:45,390
you're saying the fact that nobody would
steal it is positive I feel like it's

890

way [\h__\h] um let's say let's say it's
 

895
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,909
way [\h__\h] um let's say let's say it's
positive because otherwise it messes up

896

positive because otherwise it messes up
 

897
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:58,990

my rating okay okay okay okay uh so
 

899
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,549
my rating okay okay okay okay uh so
it wouldn't get stolen so it's not

900
00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:01,559
it wouldn't get stolen so it's not
 

901
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:03,630
it wouldn't get stolen so it's not
getting a point okay and then getting

902
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:03,640
getting a point okay and then getting
 

903
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,310
getting a point okay and then getting
stuck I would say it has getting stuck

904
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:05,320
stuck I would say it has getting stuck
 

905
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,750
stuck I would say it has getting stuck
potential because it's kind of low it's

906
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:07,760
potential because it's kind of low it's
 

907
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,510
potential because it's kind of low it's
really low yeah I feel like if you took

908
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:09,520
really low yeah I feel like if you took
 

909

that's a negative yes it's not good that
it could get stuck yeah 10 out of 10 get

918
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:21,200
it could get stuck yeah 10 out of 10 get
 

919
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,789
it could get stuck yeah 10 out of 10 get
stuck speed bumps uh-oh get in trouble

1070
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:57,120
it's probably a fast car but I would
 

1071
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,070
it's probably a fast car but I would
imagine that it's inconvenient in that

1072
00:26:59,070 --> 00:26:59,080
imagine that it's inconvenient in that
 

1073
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,029
imagine that it's inconvenient in that
way and it's the same thing with the

1074
00:27:01,029 --> 00:27:01,039
way and it's the same thing with the
 

1075
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,269
way and it's the same thing with the
last Tasha we saw it's got sheown on it

maybe the driver is also Harvard
 

1081
00:27:09,399 --> 00:27:11,830
maybe the driver is also Harvard
graduate and then then that means that

1082
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:11,840
graduate and then then that means that
 

1083
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,870
graduate and then then that means that
they could maybe not outrun the cops but

1084
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:14,880
they could maybe not outrun the cops but
 

1085
