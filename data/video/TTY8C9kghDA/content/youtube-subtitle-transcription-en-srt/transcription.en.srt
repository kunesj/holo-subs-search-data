2160
00:56:57,109 --> 00:56:57,119
in the calls and I was hoping that maybe
 

2161
00:56:57,119 --> 00:56:59,450
in the calls and I was hoping that maybe
we could like put the chance on the

2162
00:56:59,450 --> 00:56:59,460
we could like put the chance on the
 

2163
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:01,970
we could like put the chance on the

2164
00:57:01,970 --> 00:57:01,980
screen so that I know that so many
 

2165
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:04,250

people would know the song So for them

2166
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:04,260
people would know the song So for them
 

2167
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:06,470
people would know the song So for them
that they could maybe follow along by

2168
00:57:06,470 --> 00:57:06,480
that they could maybe follow along by
 

2169
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,690
that they could maybe follow along by
looking at the screen but I asked for it

2170
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:08,700

2171
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:10,250
looking at the screen but I asked for it
and they didn't do it so I guess that's

2172
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:10,260
and they didn't do it so I guess that's
 

2173
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,470
and they didn't do it so I guess that's
okay but
