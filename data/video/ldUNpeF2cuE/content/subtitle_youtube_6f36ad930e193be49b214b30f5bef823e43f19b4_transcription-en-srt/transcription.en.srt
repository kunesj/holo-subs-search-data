that makes it difficult because in the

3002
01:02:16,390 --> 01:02:16,400
that makes it difficult because in the
 

3003
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,829
that makes it difficult because in the
future if we ever want to do like

3004
01:02:17,829 --> 01:02:17,839
future if we ever want to do like
 

3005

minecraft collabs even on my

3006
01:02:19,510 --> 01:02:19,520
minecraft collabs even on my
 

3007
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:21,349
minecraft collabs even on my
even on my end right uh that's a

3008
01:02:21,349 --> 01:02:21,359
even on my end right uh that's a
 

3009
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:23,190
even on my end right uh that's a
difficult situation we will find a

3010
01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:23,200
difficult situation we will find a
 

3011
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,150
difficult situation we will find a
solution

3012
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:24,160
solution
 

3013
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:28,630
solution
eventually we need to play other games

3014
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:28,640

 

3015
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:31,430

i heard though that um you could we

3016
01:02:31,430 --> 01:02:31,440
i heard though that um you could we
 

3017
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:31,990
i heard though that um you could we
could

3018
01:02:31,990 --> 01:02:32,000
could
 

3019
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,029
could
possibly move our ramps server to like a

3020
01:02:35,029 --> 01:02:35,039
possibly move our ramps server to like a
 

3021
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:38,390
possibly move our ramps server to like a
proper server and then it works better

3022
01:02:38,390 --> 01:02:38,400
proper server and then it works better
 

3023
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,190
proper server and then it works better
but i don't know i'm fine with that i've

3024
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:41,200
but i don't know i'm fine with that i've
 

3025
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:42,710
but i don't know i'm fine with that i've
established nothing in this game

3026
01:02:42,710 --> 01:02:42,720
established nothing in this game
 

3027
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,630
established nothing in this game
but the others might be a little

3028
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:44,640
but the others might be a little
 

3029
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,390
but the others might be a little
hesitant

3030
01:02:46,390 --> 01:02:46,400
hesitant
 

3031
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:48,230
hesitant

3032
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:48,240

3033
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:49,430
