else um and GAA came up with an idea
that in its final form was a little bit

1016

fleshed out by
 

1023
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:44,149
fleshed out by
jenma uh yeah her idea was um doing like

1049
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,590
flame because you can translate rose
into French and blood flame into French

1050
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:18,600
into French and blood flame into French
 

1051
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,710

I don't know what you would do about

1052
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:19,720
I don't know what you would do about
 

1053
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,789
I don't know what you would do about
Elizabeth but that's like one of the few

1054
00:28:21,789 --> 00:28:21,799
Elizabeth but that's like one of the few
 

1055
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:23,590
Elizabeth but that's like one of the few
names that would kind of like work and

1056
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:23,600
names that would kind of like work and
 

1057
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,950
names that would kind of like work and
then we realized most other names will

1058
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:25,960
then we realized most other names will
 

1059
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,870
then we realized most other names will
not really work like it's going to be

1060
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:27,880
not really work like it's going to be
 

1061
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,590
not really work like it's going to be
hard to translate into actual

1062
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:30,600
hard to translate into actual
 

1063
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:34,029
hard to translate into actual
words um at least parts of the

1064
00:28:34,029 --> 00:28:34,039
words um at least parts of the
 

1065
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:37,669
words um at least parts of the
name so I see what jenma has come up

1066
00:28:37,669 --> 00:28:37,679
name so I see what jenma has come up
 

1067
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,549
name so I see what jenma has come up
with to improve this idea a little bit

1068
00:28:40,549 --> 00:28:40,559
with to improve this idea a little bit
 

1069
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:44,230
with to improve this idea a little bit
uh it was the the lore introductions of

1070
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:44,240
uh it was the the lore introductions of
 

1071
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,710
uh it was the the lore introductions of
like what we

1072
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:45,720
like what we
 

1073
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,630
like what we
are like uh the Priestess of the ancient

1074
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:49,640
are like uh the Priestess of the ancient
 

1075
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,789
are like uh the Priestess of the ancient
ones was translated

1076
00:28:51,789 --> 00:28:51,799
ones was translated
 

1077
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:54,870
ones was translated
into uh French and that worked really

1078
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:54,880
into uh French and that worked really
 

1079
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,750
into uh French and that worked really
well because the words kind of

1080
00:28:58,750 --> 00:28:58,760
well because the words kind of
 

1081
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,310
well because the words kind of
sometimes sound a little bit similar to

1082
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:01,320
sometimes sound a little bit similar to
 

1083
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,029
sometimes sound a little bit similar to
what they are in English and you can

1084
00:29:03,029 --> 00:29:03,039
what they are in English and you can
 

1085
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,430
what they are in English and you can
kind of guess it and that worked really

1086
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:05,440
kind of guess it and that worked really
 

1087
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,430
kind of guess it and that worked really
well it's a really good idea like we can

1088
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:07,440
well it's a really good idea like we can
 

1089
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,990
well it's a really good idea like we can
keep that idea for the future if there's

1090
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:09,000
keep that idea for the future if there's
 

1091
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,190
keep that idea for the future if there's
a similar uh thing which I don't think

1092
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:11,200
a similar uh thing which I don't think
 

1093
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,870
a similar uh thing which I don't think
you can do this in American conventions

1094
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:12,880
you can do this in American conventions
 

1095
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,549
you can do this in American conventions
because English English and this works

1096
00:29:14,549 --> 00:29:14,559
because English English and this works
 

1097
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,029
because English English and this works
because it was a French convention but

1098
00:29:16,029 --> 00:29:16,039
because it was a French convention but
 

1099
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:17,990
because it was a French convention but
maybe in the future for other like

1100
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:18,000
maybe in the future for other like
 

1101
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,040
maybe in the future for other like
similar

1102
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:21,050

1106
00:29:25,909 --> 00:29:25,919
cases but then we were brainstorming
 

1107
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:30,230
cases but then we were brainstorming
this all happened on like Friday we were

1108
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:30,240
this all happened on like Friday we were
 

1109
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,269
this all happened on like Friday we were
brainstorming a bit

1110
00:29:32,269 --> 00:29:32,279
brainstorming a bit
 

1111
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:36,710
brainstorming a bit
more cat hair in my mouth we were

1112
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:36,720
more cat hair in my mouth we were
 

1113
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,389
more cat hair in my mouth we were
brainstorming a little bit more about

1114
00:29:38,389 --> 00:29:38,399
brainstorming a little bit more about
 

1115
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,830
brainstorming a little bit more about
like how can we we have a whole hour

1116
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:40,840
like how can we we have a whole hour
 

1117
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,990
like how can we we have a whole hour
like doing this one game a whole hour I

1118
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:43,000
like doing this one game a whole hour I
 

1119
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,830
like doing this one game a whole hour I
don't know about that so I thought what

1120
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:45,840
don't know about that so I thought what
 

1121
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,269
don't know about that so I thought what
other like French game can we

1122
00:29:49,269 --> 00:29:49,279
other like French game can we
 

1123
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:50,870
other like French game can we
create

1124
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:50,880
create
 

1125
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,310
create
and uh JMA said let's do something food

1126
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:54,320
and uh JMA said let's do something food
 

1127
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,750
and uh JMA said let's do something food
related I was like H okay French Foods

1128
00:29:58,750 --> 00:29:58,760

there surely are a lot of French foods

1130
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:01,120
there surely are a lot of French foods
 

1131
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,190
there surely are a lot of French foods
and then I think I had the idea that we

1132
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:03,200
and then I think I had the idea that we
 

1133
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,789
and then I think I had the idea that we
should put up like ingredients only

1134
00:30:05,789 --> 00:30:05,799
should put up like ingredients only
 

1135
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:09,590
should put up like ingredients only
pictures of a few ingredients of Famous

pictures of a few ingredients of Famous
 

1137
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,669
pictures of a few ingredients of Famous
Foods French foods and then we should

1138
00:30:12,669 --> 00:30:12,679
Foods French foods and then we should
 

1139
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:16,269
Foods French foods and then we should

1501
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,670
know but I'm I'm not going to go out of
my way and scan each code and check back

1502
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:57,680
my way and scan each code and check back
 

1503
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,470
my way and scan each code and check back
beforehand if they go to the right place

1504
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:01,480
beforehand if they go to the right place
 

1505
