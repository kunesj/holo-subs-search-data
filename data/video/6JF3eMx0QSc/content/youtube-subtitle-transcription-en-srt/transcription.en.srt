on this but if we're thinking about oh

474
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:43,240
on this but if we're thinking about oh

yeah yeah kind of SC if we mess up like

486
00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:01,839
yeah yeah kind of SC if we mess up like
 

487
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,110
yeah yeah kind of SC if we mess up like
this we can still get a new one but

488
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:03,120
this we can still get a new one but
 

489
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,549
this we can still get a new one but
technically I think once uh if you paint

490
00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:05,559
technically I think once uh if you paint
 

491
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:06,990
technically I think once uh if you paint
it and if you mess up you can kind of

492
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:07,000
it and if you mess up you can kind of
 

493
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,429
it and if you mess up you can kind of
wipe it off until until you harden it

494
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:09,439
wipe it off until until you harden it
 

495
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,630
wipe it off until until you harden it
with the the the that thing over there

496
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:12,640
with the the the that thing over there
 

497
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,189
with the the the that thing over there
yes exactly yeah one UV light once you

498
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:15,199
yes exactly yeah one UV light once you
 

499
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,390
yes exactly yeah one UV light once you
UV light it it's it's over it's over you

500
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:17,400
UV light it it's it's over it's over you
 

501
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,990
UV light it it's it's over it's over you
have to only you can only paint over it

502
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:19,000
have to only you can only paint over it
 

503
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,029
have to only you can only paint over it
that's your best option okay then no

504
00:17:22,029 --> 00:17:22,039
that's your best option okay then no
 

505
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:24,590
that's your best option okay then no
still maybe we'll do it directly okay

506
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:24,600
still maybe we'll do it directly okay
 

507
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,350
still maybe we'll do it directly okay
yeah okay so we'll glue these on first

508
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:26,360
yeah okay so we'll glue these on first
 

509
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,390
yeah okay so we'll glue these on first
then

510
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:27,400
then
 

511
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,669
then
right yeah afterward huh oh I thought oh

512
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:31,679
right yeah afterward huh oh I thought oh
 

513
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,830
right yeah afterward huh oh I thought oh
directly on here yeah okay okay that

514
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:33,840
directly on here yeah okay okay that
 

515
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,190
directly on here yeah okay okay that
makes sense but uh we should I guess got

516
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:36,200
makes sense but uh we should I guess got
 

517
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,630
makes sense but uh we should I guess got
to select keep them on the on this side

518
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:38,640
to select keep them on the on this side
 

519
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,870
to select keep them on the on this side
I no I tore this one off oh well I mean

520
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:41,880
I no I tore this one off oh well I mean
 

521
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,190
I no I tore this one off oh well I mean
if you think about it they're all

522
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:43,200
if you think about it they're all
 

523
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,870
if you think about it they're all
different sizes right so I feel like you

524
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:44,880
different sizes right so I feel like you
 

525
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,590
different sizes right so I feel like you
really got to choose which ones are

526
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:46,600
really got to choose which ones are
 

527
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,590
really got to choose which ones are
proper cuz whenever I go get mine done

528
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:48,600
proper cuz whenever I go get mine done
 

529
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,710
proper cuz whenever I go get mine done
they like they choose they fit a bunch

530
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:50,720
they like they choose they fit a bunch
 

531
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,669
they like they choose they fit a bunch
of them and they're like oh this one

532
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:51,679
of them and they're like oh this one
 

533
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,669
of them and they're like oh this one
works oh this one doesn't they glue

534
00:17:53,669 --> 00:17:53,679
works oh this one doesn't they glue
 

535
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,590
works oh this one doesn't they glue
automatically the one that fits so we

536
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:55,600
automatically the one that fits so we
 

537
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,549
automatically the one that fits so we
might want to select the sizes first

538
00:17:57,549 --> 00:17:57,559
might want to select the sizes first
 

539
00:17:57,559 --> 00:17:58,750
might want to select the sizes first
yeah yeah that's that's what I was

540
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:58,760
yeah yeah that's that's what I was
 

541
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:02,510
yeah yeah that's that's what I was
saying but uh is it easier to keep them

542
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:02,520
saying but uh is it easier to keep them
 

543
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,190
saying but uh is it easier to keep them
on here I mean it might be paint like

544
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:05,200
on here I mean it might be paint like
 

545
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,950
on here I mean it might be paint like
this it might be cuz like if you already

546
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:06,960
this it might be cuz like if you already
 

547
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,950
this it might be cuz like if you already
tear it off how do you hold it to you

548
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:08,960
tear it off how do you hold it to you
 

549
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,470
tear it off how do you hold it to you
have to use like a I don't like a

550

tweezer or something to hold it it is a
 

553
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,630
tweezer or something to hold it it is a
little annoying so maybe we should keep

554
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:13,640
little annoying so maybe we should keep
 

555
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,909
little annoying so maybe we should keep
it on there yeah okay then I'll I'll

556

that's what works fine for me how do we

560
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:22,480
that's what works fine for me how do we
 

561
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,909
that's what works fine for me how do we
let the other person know can we mark it

562
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:25,919
let the other person know can we mark it
 

563

that cuz like basically you just used a

3196
01:15:12,149 --> 01:15:12,159
that cuz like basically you just used a
 

3197
01:15:12,159 --> 01:15:15,229
that cuz like basically you just used a
golden a couple golden coats then did a

3198

you know what I'll just test it like

4344
01:40:47,709 --> 01:40:47,719
you know what I'll just test it like
 

4345
01:40:47,719 --> 01:40:49,910
you know what I'll just test it like
this I'll look at them next to each

4346
01:40:49,910 --> 01:40:49,920
this I'll look at them next to each
 

4347
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:51,430
this I'll look at them next to each
other

4348
01:40:51,430 --> 01:40:51,440
other
 

4349
01:40:51,440 --> 01:40:52,870
other
that seems

4350

that seems
 

4351
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:59,589
that seems
correct maybe

4352
01:40:59,589 --> 01:40:59,599

 

4353
01:40:59,599 --> 01:41:03,790

oh what what is this don't know how to
 

4355
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:06,189
oh what what is this don't know how to
break this without being a rain on your

what I've heard about from nail artists
 

4375
01:41:33,080 --> 01:41:35,990
what I've heard about from nail artists
though is that the UV light is one time

01:41:35,990 --> 01:41:36,000
though is that the UV light is one time
 

4377
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,070

01:41:38,070 --> 01:41:38,080
using the UV light over in the lamps
 

4379
01:41:38,080 --> 01:41:40,270

over there for the light for the nails
 

4381
01:41:40,280 --> 01:41:42,990
over there for the light for the nails

purple looks deeper I'll do that one
which is the is it the Builder nail I

5234
02:00:50,550 --> 02:00:50,560
which is the is it the Builder nail I
 

5235
02:00:50,560 --> 02:00:52,910
which is the is it the Builder nail I
think so or is it the which is the top

5236
02:00:52,910 --> 02:00:52,920
think so or is it the which is the top
 

5237
02:00:52,920 --> 02:00:55,350
think so or is it the which is the top
coat uh it'll say top coat on it you do

5238
02:00:55,350 --> 02:00:55,360
coat uh it'll say top coat on it you do
 

5239
02:00:55,360 --> 02:00:57,669
coat uh it'll say top coat on it you do
one of those and then you do a UV coat

5240
02:00:57,669 --> 02:00:57,679
one of those and then you do a UV coat
 

5241
02:00:57,679 --> 02:00:59,109
one of those and then you do a UV coat
huh which wait wait wait wait this is

5242
02:00:59,109 --> 02:00:59,119
huh which wait wait wait wait this is
 

5243
02:00:59,119 --> 02:01:01,510
huh which wait wait wait wait this is
the top that's a top coat and then the

5244
02:01:01,510 --> 02:01:01,520
the top that's a top coat and then the
 

5245
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:03,470
the top that's a top coat and then the
UV coat is the black one yeah that's

5246
02:01:03,470 --> 02:01:03,480
UV coat is the black one yeah that's
 

5247
02:01:03,480 --> 02:01:06,709
UV coat is the black one yeah that's
probably build two long skis oh so you

5248
02:01:06,709 --> 02:01:06,719
probably build two long skis oh so you
 

5249
02:01:06,719 --> 02:01:08,069
probably build two long skis oh so you
do two more coats you do top and then

5250
02:01:08,069 --> 02:01:08,079
do two more coats you do top and then
 

5251
02:01:08,079 --> 02:01:11,629
do two more coats you do top and then
you do yeah oh okay

5252
02:01:11,629 --> 02:01:11,639
you do yeah oh okay
 

5253
02:01:11,639 --> 02:01:13,669
you do yeah oh okay
okay that case I still have two more

5254
02:01:13,669 --> 02:01:13,679
okay that case I still have two more
 

5255
02:01:13,679 --> 02:01:17,270
okay that case I still have two more
layers okay I'll use the new

5256
02:01:17,270 --> 02:01:17,280
layers okay I'll use the new
 

5257
02:01:17,280 --> 02:01:20,310
layers okay I'll use the new
one and maybe it is maybe it is Builder

5258
02:01:20,310 --> 02:01:20,320
one and maybe it is maybe it is Builder
 

5259
02:01:20,320 --> 02:01:22,030
one and maybe it is maybe it is Builder
first but I mean I think either way it's

5260
02:01:22,030 --> 02:01:22,040
first but I mean I think either way it's
 

5261
02:01:22,040 --> 02:01:23,510
first but I mean I think either way it's
fine as long as you keep putting coats

5262
02:01:23,510 --> 02:01:23,520
fine as long as you keep putting coats
 

5263
02:01:23,520 --> 02:01:24,910
fine as long as you keep putting coats
on it and like curing it I think it's

5264
02:01:24,910 --> 02:01:24,920
on it and like curing it I think it's
 

5265
02:01:24,920 --> 02:01:27,709
on it and like curing it I think it's
fine but you might need to do the UV one

5266
02:01:27,709 --> 02:01:27,719
fine but you might need to do the UV one
 

5267
02:01:27,719 --> 02:01:29,790
fine but you might need to do the UV one
and then top coat after it's okay you

5268
02:01:29,790 --> 02:01:29,800
and then top coat after it's okay you
 

5269
02:01:29,800 --> 02:01:31,310
and then top coat after it's okay you
can do top coat I did top coat it's okay

5272
02:01:33,470 --> 02:01:33,480
you can do top coat UV and then top coat
 

5273
02:01:33,480 --> 02:01:34,629
you can do top coat UV and then top coat
again should be

5274
02:01:34,629 --> 02:01:34,639
again should be
 

5275
02:01:34,639 --> 02:01:36,910
again should be
fine that's what I did and they seem

5276
02:01:36,910 --> 02:01:36,920
fine that's what I did and they seem
 

5277
02:01:36,920 --> 02:01:39,910
fine that's what I did and they seem
solid so should be top coat UV top coat

5278
02:01:39,910 --> 02:01:39,920
solid so should be top coat UV top coat

5281
02:01:42,920 --> 02:01:47,750
yeah I think that'll be fine okay just
sticks of nail Sal yeah it's a science

more time maybe a second layer would go

5320
02:02:39,830 --> 02:02:39,840
more time maybe a second layer would go
 

5321
02:02:39,840 --> 02:02:41,510
more time maybe a second layer would go
smoother I don't know yeah but I'll do
