something
and in this case there's something that

7008
03:15:28,730 --> 03:15:28,740
and in this case there's something that
 

7009
03:15:28,740 --> 03:15:31,490

yeah I think she must have been added
 

7045
03:16:13,500 --> 03:16:15,230
yeah I think she must have been added
while I was gone for the month but she's

7046
03:16:15,230 --> 03:16:15,240
while I was gone for the month but she's
 

7047
03:16:15,240 --> 03:16:17,389
while I was gone for the month but she's
still doing it now I don't think she was

7048
03:16:17,389 --> 03:16:17,399
still doing it now I don't think she was
 

7049
03:16:17,399 --> 03:16:19,070
still doing it now I don't think she was
doing it in the beginning like this

7050
03:16:19,070 --> 03:16:19,080
doing it in the beginning like this
 

7051
03:16:19,080 --> 03:16:21,349
doing it in the beginning like this
vigorously

7052
03:16:21,349 --> 03:16:21,359
vigorously
 

7053
03:16:21,359 --> 03:16:23,809
vigorously
yeah I have to check if there's maybe a

7054
03:16:23,809 --> 03:16:23,819
yeah I have to check if there's maybe a
 

7055
03:16:23,819 --> 03:16:26,870
yeah I have to check if there's maybe a
replacement or I don't know

7056
03:16:26,870 --> 03:16:26,880
replacement or I don't know
 

7057
03:16:26,880 --> 03:16:28,730
replacement or I don't know
because the toilet was expensive I

7058
03:16:28,730 --> 03:16:28,740
because the toilet was expensive I
 

7059
03:16:28,740 --> 03:16:31,269
because the toilet was expensive I
didn't pay for it but it was expensive

7060
03:16:31,269 --> 03:16:31,279
didn't pay for it but it was expensive
 

7061
03:16:31,279 --> 03:16:33,410
didn't pay for it but it was expensive
so maybe maybe there's like a

7062
03:16:33,410 --> 03:16:33,420
so maybe maybe there's like a
 

7063
03:16:33,420 --> 03:16:35,389
so maybe maybe there's like a
replacement for just the

7064
03:16:35,389 --> 03:16:35,399

kind of sad I didn't go skiing this year
 

7127
03:18:09,899 --> 03:18:11,389
kind of sad I didn't go skiing this year
because last year I bought all that

7128
03:18:11,389 --> 03:18:11,399
because last year I bought all that
 

7129
03:18:11,399 --> 03:18:13,010
because last year I bought all that
skiing equipment

7130
03:18:13,010 --> 03:18:13,020
skiing equipment
 

7131
03:18:13,020 --> 03:18:15,530
skiing equipment
and then even right after I bought it I

7132
03:18:15,530 --> 03:18:15,540
and then even right after I bought it I
 

7133
03:18:15,540 --> 03:18:17,330
and then even right after I bought it I
brought it to skiing vacation but then I

7134
03:18:17,330 --> 03:18:17,340
brought it to skiing vacation but then I
 

7135
03:18:17,340 --> 03:18:19,190
brought it to skiing vacation but then I
didn't use it because we figured out

7136
03:18:19,190 --> 03:18:19,200
didn't use it because we figured out
 

7137
03:18:19,200 --> 03:18:21,650
didn't use it because we figured out
that as a beginner you should be using

7138
03:18:21,650 --> 03:18:21,660
that as a beginner you should be using
 

7139
03:18:21,660 --> 03:18:24,050
that as a beginner you should be using
really short skis and the people at the

7140
03:18:24,050 --> 03:18:24,060
really short skis and the people at the
 

7141
03:18:24,060 --> 03:18:25,790
really short skis and the people at the
store didn't tell me that

7142
03:18:25,790 --> 03:18:25,800
store didn't tell me that
 

7143
03:18:25,800 --> 03:18:28,849
store didn't tell me that
when they were giving me advice on which

7144
03:18:28,849 --> 03:18:28,859
when they were giving me advice on which
 

7145
03:18:28,859 --> 03:18:31,250
when they were giving me advice on which
ones to choose

7146
03:18:31,250 --> 03:18:31,260
ones to choose
 

7147
03:18:31,260 --> 03:18:32,929
ones to choose
and then I didn't use them at all back

7148
03:18:32,929 --> 03:18:32,939
and then I didn't use them at all back
 

7149
03:18:32,939 --> 03:18:34,790
and then I didn't use them at all back
then but I thought maybe next time when

7150
03:18:34,790 --> 03:18:34,800
then but I thought maybe next time when
 

7151
03:18:34,800 --> 03:18:37,250
then but I thought maybe next time when
I get better

7152
03:18:37,250 --> 03:18:37,260
I get better
 

7153
03:18:37,260 --> 03:18:38,929
I get better
well I still didn't get better but I

7154
03:18:38,929 --> 03:18:38,939
well I still didn't get better but I
 

7155
03:18:38,939 --> 03:18:41,030
well I still didn't get better but I
could have at least used like the other

7156
03:18:41,030 --> 03:18:41,040
could have at least used like the other
 

7157
03:18:41,040 --> 03:18:44,570
could have at least used like the other
parts of the equipment

7158
03:18:44,570 --> 03:18:44,580
parts of the equipment
 

7159
03:18:44,580 --> 03:18:46,130
parts of the equipment
um

7160
03:18:46,130 --> 03:18:46,140
