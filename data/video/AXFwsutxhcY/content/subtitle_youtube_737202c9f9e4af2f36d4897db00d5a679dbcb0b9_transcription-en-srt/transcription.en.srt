do plan on using the low poly models um

5174
02:10:37,270 --> 02:10:37,280
do plan on using the low poly models um
 

5175
02:10:37,280 --> 02:10:39,910
do plan on using the low poly models um
even afterwards because um after the

5176
02:10:39,910 --> 02:10:39,920
even afterwards because um after the
 

5177
02:10:39,920 --> 02:10:41,109
even afterwards because um after the
after the

5178
02:10:41,109 --> 02:10:41,119
after the
 

5179
02:10:41,119 --> 02:10:45,109
after the
concert because i wanna

5180
02:10:45,109 --> 02:10:45,119
concert because i wanna
 

5181
02:10:45,119 --> 02:10:47,910
concert because i wanna
i don't wanna use the models uh before

5182
02:10:47,910 --> 02:10:47,920
i don't wanna use the models uh before
 

5183
02:10:47,920 --> 02:10:50,470
i don't wanna use the models uh before
doing a proper 3dw as i said before and

5184
02:10:50,470 --> 02:10:50,480
doing a proper 3dw as i said before and
 

5185
02:10:50,480 --> 02:10:53,189
doing a proper 3dw as i said before and
also i think the low poly models

5186
02:10:53,189 --> 02:10:53,199
also i think the low poly models
 

5187
02:10:53,199 --> 02:10:56,470
also i think the low poly models
they fit well into the

5188
02:10:56,470 --> 02:10:56,480
they fit well into the
 

5189
02:10:56,480 --> 02:10:58,790
they fit well into the
into the world that we had created for

5190
02:10:58,790 --> 02:10:58,800
into the world that we had created for
 

5191
02:10:58,800 --> 02:11:01,270
into the world that we had created for
the wealthy models i think they fit in

5192
02:11:01,270 --> 02:11:01,280
the wealthy models i think they fit in
 

5193
02:11:01,280 --> 02:11:04,870
the wealthy models i think they fit in
nicely i almost think that our

5194
02:11:04,870 --> 02:11:04,880
nicely i almost think that our
 

5195
02:11:04,880 --> 02:11:08,149
nicely i almost think that our
proper models may be a little bit too

5196
02:11:08,149 --> 02:11:08,159
proper models may be a little bit too
 

5197
02:11:08,159 --> 02:11:11,109
proper models may be a little bit too
too detailed and too realistic

5198
02:11:11,109 --> 02:11:11,119
too detailed and too realistic
 

5199
02:11:11,119 --> 02:11:12,870
too detailed and too realistic
i mean it would still be great and all

5200
02:11:12,870 --> 02:11:12,880
i mean it would still be great and all
 

5201
02:11:12,880 --> 02:11:14,550
i mean it would still be great and all
that and we'll

5202
02:11:14,550 --> 02:11:14,560
that and we'll
 

5203
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:17,189
that and we'll
use them eventually but

5204
02:11:17,189 --> 02:11:17,199
use them eventually but
 

5205
02:11:17,199 --> 02:11:18,870
use them eventually but
i think i think

5206
02:11:18,870 --> 02:11:18,880
i think i think
 

5207
02:11:18,880 --> 02:11:20,790
i think i think
i think um

5208
02:11:20,790 --> 02:11:20,800
i think um
 

5209
02:11:20,800 --> 02:11:22,390
i think um
yeah we need to get more use out of the

5210
02:11:22,390 --> 02:11:22,400
yeah we need to get more use out of the
 

5211
02:11:22,400 --> 02:11:24,149
yeah we need to get more use out of the
low poly models and they work great i

5212
02:11:24,149 --> 02:11:24,159
low poly models and they work great i
 

5213
02:11:24,159 --> 02:11:25,990
low poly models and they work great i
think they're good in between

5214
02:11:25,990 --> 02:11:26,000
think they're good in between
 

5215
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,629
think they're good in between

02:12:43,350 --> 02:12:43,360
it plays it and then and then
 

5289
02:12:43,360 --> 02:12:45,189
it plays it and then and then
and then uh you can look at the screen

5290
02:12:45,189 --> 02:12:45,199
and then uh you can look at the screen
 

5291
02:12:45,199 --> 02:12:47,430
and then uh you can look at the screen
together and you can also sync up even

5292
02:12:47,430 --> 02:12:47,440
together and you can also sync up even
 

5293
02:12:47,440 --> 02:12:49,669
together and you can also sync up even
more but just by playing it there it's

5294
02:12:49,669 --> 02:12:49,679
more but just by playing it there it's
 

5295
02:12:49,679 --> 02:12:51,109
more but just by playing it there it's
pretty much all

5296
02:12:51,109 --> 02:12:51,119
pretty much all
 

5297
02:12:51,119 --> 02:12:52,149
pretty much all
already

5298
02:12:52,149 --> 02:12:52,159
already
 

5299
02:12:52,159 --> 02:12:53,510
already
mostly synced up but you can still

5300
02:12:53,510 --> 02:12:53,520
mostly synced up but you can still
 

5301
02:12:53,520 --> 02:12:55,350
mostly synced up but you can still
adjust it in case it's not synced up

5302
02:12:55,350 --> 02:12:55,360
adjust it in case it's not synced up
 

5303
02:12:55,360 --> 02:12:58,950
adjust it in case it's not synced up
perfectly and then and then she um made

5304
02:12:58,950 --> 02:12:58,960
perfectly and then and then she um made
 

5305
02:12:58,960 --> 02:13:01,350
perfectly and then and then she um made
the microphone props so that if you pick

5306
02:13:01,350 --> 02:13:01,360
the microphone props so that if you pick
 

5307
02:13:01,360 --> 02:13:03,669
the microphone props so that if you pick
them up you don't hear your surroundings

5308
02:13:03,669 --> 02:13:03,679
them up you don't hear your surroundings
 

5309
02:13:03,679 --> 02:13:06,950
them up you don't hear your surroundings
so it's not confusing if um

5310
02:13:06,950 --> 02:13:06,960
so it's not confusing if um
 

5311
02:13:06,960 --> 02:13:09,270
so it's not confusing if um
if the if the other person is not in

5312
02:13:09,270 --> 02:13:09,280
if the if the other person is not in
 

5313
02:13:09,280 --> 02:13:10,229
if the if the other person is not in
sync

5314
02:13:10,229 --> 02:13:10,239
sync
 

5315
02:13:10,239 --> 02:13:13,350
sync
um but it will come out synced to

5316
02:13:13,350 --> 02:13:13,360
um but it will come out synced to
 

5317
02:13:13,360 --> 02:13:16,069
um but it will come out synced to
the third person who is listening to it

5318
02:13:16,069 --> 02:13:16,079
the third person who is listening to it
 

5319
02:13:16,079 --> 02:13:17,830
the third person who is listening to it
so i guess we would need someone to

5320
02:13:17,830 --> 02:13:17,840
so i guess we would need someone to
 

5321
02:13:17,840 --> 02:13:19,270
so i guess we would need someone to
capture the

5322
02:13:19,270 --> 02:13:19,280
capture the
 

5323
02:13:19,280 --> 02:13:20,950
capture the
third person

5324
02:13:20,950 --> 02:13:20,960
third person
 

5325
02:13:20,960 --> 02:13:22,870
third person

5345
02:13:43,280 --> 02:13:45,750

we can basically use that

5346
02:13:45,750 --> 02:13:45,760
we can basically use that
 

5347
02:13:45,760 --> 02:13:48,790
