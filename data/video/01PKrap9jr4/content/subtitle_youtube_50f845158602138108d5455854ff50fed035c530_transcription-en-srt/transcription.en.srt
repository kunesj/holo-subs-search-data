7942
03:01:06,710 --> 03:01:06,720
like you know get a different visa but
 

7943
03:01:06,720 --> 03:01:07,830
like you know get a different visa but
uh

7944
03:01:07,830 --> 03:01:07,840
uh
 

7945
03:01:07,840 --> 03:01:09,269
uh
that didn't happen

7946
03:01:09,269 --> 03:01:09,279
that didn't happen
 

7947
03:01:09,279 --> 03:01:11,269
that didn't happen
so

7948
03:01:11,269 --> 03:01:11,279
so
 

7949
03:01:11,279 --> 03:01:13,030
so
i did go home and

7950
03:01:13,030 --> 03:01:13,040
i did go home and
 

7951
03:01:13,040 --> 03:01:14,790
i did go home and
in the end i think it was the best

7952
03:01:14,790 --> 03:01:14,800
in the end i think it was the best
 

7953
03:01:14,800 --> 03:01:16,150
in the end i think it was the best
choice because even if we would have

7954
03:01:16,150 --> 03:01:16,160
choice because even if we would have
 

7955
03:01:16,160 --> 03:01:18,230
choice because even if we would have
extended it let's say for three months

7956
03:01:18,230 --> 03:01:18,240
extended it let's say for three months
 

7957
03:01:18,240 --> 03:01:22,309
extended it let's say for three months
or six months well look where we are now

7958
