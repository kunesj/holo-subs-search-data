2813
01:18:57,909 --> 01:19:01,319

Hey, where did you believe that?

There's a place where you can hold up that pretty thing. It's a dropship,
 

2817
01:19:03,369 --> 01:19:10,429
There's a place where you can hold up that pretty thing. It's a dropship,
so it's often on the side. Left and right. Don't look.

2818
01:19:10,429 --> 01:19:10,439

 

2819
01:19:10,439 --> 01:19:14,219

If you want to pretend, it's on the right side.

want someone to come with me. So I guess
 

3921
01:51:34,830 --> 01:51:38,630
want someone to come with me. So I guess
I'll go with Comet-senpai. Either that
