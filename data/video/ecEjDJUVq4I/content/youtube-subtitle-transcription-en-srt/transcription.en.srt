2363
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:36,170
wait so with the whole portal are we
creating itself over and over again like

2364
00:57:36,170 --> 00:57:36,180
creating itself over and over again like
 

2365
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:38,329
creating itself over and over again like
that was the bug

2366
00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:38,339
that was the bug
 

2367
00:57:38,339 --> 00:57:40,849
that was the bug

2368
00:57:40,849 --> 00:57:40,859
I've had that issue too but I don't know
 

2369
00:57:40,859 --> 00:57:42,829
I've had that issue too but I don't know
if that was normal or not well it's

2370
00:57:42,829 --> 00:57:42,839
if that was normal or not well it's
 

2371
00:57:42,839 --> 00:57:45,410
if that was normal or not well it's
actually that can be normal

2372
00:57:45,410 --> 00:57:45,420
actually that can be normal
 

2373
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:46,190
actually that can be normal
um

2374
00:57:46,190 --> 00:57:46,200
um
 

2375
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:49,069
um
yeah it can be normal there is a problem

2376
00:57:49,069 --> 00:57:49,079
yeah it can be normal there is a problem
 

2377
00:57:49,079 --> 00:57:51,109
yeah it can be normal there is a problem
there was a bug with the the way the

2378
00:57:51,109 --> 00:57:51,119
there was a bug with the the way the
 

2379
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:54,890
there was a bug with the the way the
portals link but I just I like I

2380
00:57:54,890 --> 00:57:54,900
portals link but I just I like I
 

2381
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:57,890
portals link but I just I like I
researched a lot on how portals work

2382
00:57:57,890 --> 00:57:57,900
researched a lot on how portals work
 

2383
00:57:57,900 --> 00:57:59,990
researched a lot on how portals work
um they're not actually linked to one

2384
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:00,000
um they're not actually linked to one
 

2385
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,210
um they're not actually linked to one
another like if you build a portal it

2386
00:58:02,210 --> 00:58:02,220
another like if you build a portal it
 

2387
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:04,730
another like if you build a portal it
doesn't necessarily link to a portal on

2388
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:04,740
doesn't necessarily link to a portal on
 

2389
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:07,010
doesn't necessarily link to a portal on
the other side it just sends you to the

2390
00:58:07,010 --> 00:58:07,020
the other side it just sends you to the
 

2391
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:09,829
the other side it just sends you to the
closest portal but the corresponding

2392
00:58:09,829 --> 00:58:09,839
closest portal but the corresponding
 

2393
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:11,930
closest portal but the corresponding
coordinates in the Overworld so that's

2394
00:58:11,930 --> 00:58:11,940
coordinates in the Overworld so that's
 

2395
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:14,089
coordinates in the Overworld so that's
why you can have a situation where

2396
00:58:14,089 --> 00:58:14,099
why you can have a situation where
 

2397
00:58:14,099 --> 00:58:16,549
why you can have a situation where
you could have like three portals that

2398
00:58:16,549 --> 00:58:16,559
you could have like three portals that
 

2399
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:19,150
you could have like three portals that
are linked which is very annoying

2400
00:58:19,150 --> 00:58:19,160
are linked which is very annoying
 

2401
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:21,829
are linked which is very annoying
yes yes

01:55:05,090 --> 01:55:05,100
what the hell
 

4727
01:55:05,100 --> 01:55:07,310
what the hell
I guess this is why they recommend you

4728
01:55:07,310 --> 01:55:07,320
I guess this is why they recommend you
 

4729
01:55:07,320 --> 01:55:09,530
I guess this is why they recommend you
find fortresses in a certain biome

4730
01:55:09,530 --> 01:55:09,540
find fortresses in a certain biome
 

4731
01:55:09,540 --> 01:55:11,870
find fortresses in a certain biome
because they can increase the spawn

4732
01:55:11,870 --> 01:55:11,880
because they can increase the spawn
 

4733
01:55:11,880 --> 01:55:14,149
because they can increase the spawn
rates because here I think like the pigs
