2154
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:27,520

2155
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,349
a proxy I hope I don't get bonked for
saying this I don't know if it's uh I

2156
00:57:30,349 --> 00:57:30,359
saying this I don't know if it's uh I
 

2157
00:57:30,359 --> 00:57:33,069
saying this I don't know if it's uh I
should not be

2158
00:57:33,069 --> 00:57:33,079
should not be
 

2159
00:57:33,079 --> 00:57:34,990
should not be
advertising but yeah yeah it's like a

2160
00:57:34,990 --> 00:57:35,000
advertising but yeah yeah it's like a
 

2161
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,910
advertising but yeah yeah it's like a
shipping forwarder it you will you'll be

2162
00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:36,920
shipping forwarder it you will you'll be
 

2163
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:40,589
shipping forwarder it you will you'll be
able to use a Japanese address and then

2164
00:57:40,589 --> 00:57:40,599
able to use a Japanese address and then
 

2165
00:57:40,599 --> 00:57:43,190
able to use a Japanese address and then
I think it overall makes the shipping

2166
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:43,200
I think it overall makes the shipping
 

2167
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:46,230
I think it overall makes the shipping
cheaper cuz they take care of it kind of

2168
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:46,240
cheaper cuz they take care of it kind of
 

2169
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:52,150
cheaper cuz they take care of it kind of
I think and then they send it to

into just because he's pretty cute and
 

2327
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:16,990
into just because he's pretty cute and
easy to keep as a pet probably um cuz he

2328
01:02:16,990 --> 01:02:17,000
easy to keep as a pet probably um cuz he
 

2329
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,829
easy to keep as a pet probably um cuz he
thinks he thinks he's doing something

2330

with that claw but it's really not that
 

2333
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:23,390
with that claw but it's really not that
efficient but let's just let him think

2334
01:02:23,390 --> 01:02:23,400
efficient but let's just let him think
 

2335
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:27,069
efficient but let's just let him think
that he's doing something there yeah

2336
01:02:27,069 --> 01:02:27,079
that he's doing something there yeah
 

2337
01:02:27,079 --> 01:02:30,470
that he's doing something there yeah
next we have the pond frog which is also

2338
01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:30,480
next we have the pond frog which is also
 

2339
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,630
next we have the pond frog which is also
like kind of same

2340
01:02:32,630 --> 01:02:32,640
like kind of same
 

2341
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:35,870
like kind of same
issue um or I I don't know if it's an

reflex not really interesting not really

2836
01:15:16,270 --> 01:15:16,280
reflex not really interesting not really
 

2837
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:17,669
reflex not really interesting not really
efficient anyway I think but they do

2838
01:15:17,669 --> 01:15:17,679
efficient anyway I think but they do
 

2839
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:19,750
efficient anyway I think but they do
that to show off their belly and their

2840
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:19,760
that to show off their belly and their
 

2841
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:21,470
that to show off their belly and their
fancy colors on their belly are supposed

2842
01:15:21,470 --> 01:15:21,480
fancy colors on their belly are supposed
 

2843
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:23,790
fancy colors on their belly are supposed
to look threatening I mean yeah I mean

2844
01:15:23,790 --> 01:15:23,800
to look threatening I mean yeah I mean
 

2845
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:25,910
to look threatening I mean yeah I mean
we all know if a frog looks like this

2846
01:15:25,910 --> 01:15:25,920
we all know if a frog looks like this
 

2847
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:27,870
we all know if a frog looks like this
he's probably poisonous and then will'll

2848
01:15:27,870 --> 01:15:27,880
he's probably poisonous and then will'll
 

2849
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:30,709
he's probably poisonous and then will'll
probably stay away so yeah show it off I

2850
01:15:30,709 --> 01:15:30,719
probably stay away so yeah show it off I
 

2851
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:32,510
probably stay away so yeah show it off I
guess that is really efficient even to

2852
01:15:32,510 --> 01:15:32,520
guess that is really efficient even to
 

2853
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:36,510
guess that is really efficient even to
to humans um but even though he's

2854
01:15:36,510 --> 01:15:36,520
to humans um but even though he's
 

2855
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:38,510
to humans um but even though he's
poisonous he's very easy to keep as a

2856
01:15:38,510 --> 01:15:38,520
poisonous he's very easy to keep as a
 

2857
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:40,830
poisonous he's very easy to keep as a

a pet but when you keep him as a pet the
 

2861
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:45,950
a pet but when you keep him as a pet the

of grow a little bit darker and more

2864
01:15:48,830 --> 01:15:48,840
of grow a little bit darker and more
 

2865
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:52,430
of grow a little bit darker and more
subdued so to say

2866
01:15:52,430 --> 01:15:52,440
subdued so to say
 

2867
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:55,870
subdued so to say
so he might not look like is if you keep
