um yeah i think

1552
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:40,720

 

1553
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,710

yeah so but but there's there's a few

1554
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:42,720
yeah so but but there's there's a few
 

1555
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,870
yeah so but but there's there's a few
letters in japanese that have only one

1556
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:44,880
letters in japanese that have only one
 

1557
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,710
letters in japanese that have only one
letter so for example

1558
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:48,720

 

1559
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,470

and was there anything else i think

1560
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:50,480
and was there anything else i think
 

1561
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,069
and was there anything else i think
that's probably about i might be missing

1562
00:40:52,069 --> 00:40:52,079
that's probably about i might be missing
 

1563
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:53,030
that's probably about i might be missing
out on something but

1564
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:53,040
out on something but
 

1565
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,270
out on something but
pretty much that's it so these yes are

1566
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:55,280
pretty much that's it so these yes are
 

1567
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,109
pretty much that's it so these yes are
one letter but everything else always

1568
00:40:57,109 --> 00:40:57,119
one letter but everything else always
 

1569
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:58,470
one letter but everything else always
comes with two letters and

1570
00:40:58,470 --> 00:40:58,480
comes with two letters and
 

1571
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,870
comes with two letters and
um but the thing is that you is often

1572
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:00,880
um but the thing is that you is often
 

1573
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,870
um but the thing is that you is often
silent in japanese language

1574
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:02,880
silent in japanese language
 

1575
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,109
silent in japanese language
so for example there's a silent you

1576
00:41:07,109 --> 00:41:07,119
so for example there's a silent you
 

1577
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:10,470
so for example there's a silent you
at the end so it gets it gets close

1578
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:10,480
at the end so it gets it gets close
 

1579
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,030
at the end so it gets it gets close
enough but

1580
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:11,040
