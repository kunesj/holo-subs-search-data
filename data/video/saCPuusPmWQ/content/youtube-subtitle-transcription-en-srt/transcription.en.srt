started playing a little bit with Ahmed
 

709
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:43,490
started playing a little bit with Ahmed
just to like create a save file I was

710
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:43,500
just to like create a save file I was
 

711
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,350
just to like create a save file I was
hoping to create a safer because I

712
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:45,360
hoping to create a safer because I
 

713
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,750
hoping to create a safer because I
didn't see any save file in the game

714
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:47,760
didn't see any save file in the game
 

715
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,730
didn't see any save file in the game
folder but I guess I was looking in the

716
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:49,740
folder but I guess I was looking in the
 

717
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,890
folder but I guess I was looking in the
wrong place and then

718
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:51,900
wrong place and then
 

719
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,570
wrong place and then
um I just started playing and I just

720
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:53,580
um I just started playing and I just
 

721
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,130
um I just started playing and I just
wanted to play it for five seconds or so

722
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:55,140
wanted to play it for five seconds or so
 

723
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,049
wanted to play it for five seconds or so
and hoping that that would create a save

724
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:57,059
and hoping that that would create a save
 

725
00:21:57,059 --> 00:22:00,770
and hoping that that would create a save
file but then it didn't but anyway I

726
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:00,780
file but then it didn't but anyway I
 

727
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,450
file but then it didn't but anyway I
played the whole 20 minutes because I

728
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:02,460
played the whole 20 minutes because I
 

729
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,370

just couldn't stop myself and
 

731
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,710
