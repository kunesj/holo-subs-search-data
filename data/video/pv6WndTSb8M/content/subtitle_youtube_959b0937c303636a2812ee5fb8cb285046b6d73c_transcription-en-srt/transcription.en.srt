testing why is there a need to test when

1596
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:10,480
testing why is there a need to test when
 

1597
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,710
testing why is there a need to test when
at that point

1598
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:12,720
at that point
 

1599
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,870
at that point
there's no more need for testing

1600
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:16,880

 

1601
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,470

wait what are you testing for if there's

1602
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:18,480
wait what are you testing for if there's
 

1603
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,630
wait what are you testing for if there's
no more humans

1604
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:20,640
no more humans
 

1605
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,390
no more humans
what are you gonna use that testing for

1606
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:22,400
what are you gonna use that testing for
 

1607
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:37,030
what are you gonna use that testing for
at that point

1608
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:37,040

 

1609
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,750

i wanted to speed from that okay but

1610
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:39,760
i wanted to speed from that okay but
 

1611
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,630
i wanted to speed from that okay but
okay

1612
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:40,640
okay
 

1613
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,870
okay
so we're here now

1614
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:42,880
so we're here now
 

1615
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,630
so we're here now
um

1616
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:44,640
um
 

1617
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,069

but
 

1619
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,230
but
okay so that floor i can't make a portal

1620
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:48,240
okay so that floor i can't make a portal
 

1621
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,430
okay so that floor i can't make a portal
on

1622
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:49,440

wait
was that happening because i activated

3082
01:12:59,910 --> 01:12:59,920
was that happening because i activated
 

3083
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:01,110
was that happening because i activated
that

3084
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:01,120
that
 

3085
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:03,350
that
i guess it dropped one

3086
01:13:03,350 --> 01:13:03,360
i guess it dropped one
 

3087
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:09,030
i guess it dropped one
and now it's just bouncing there

3088
01:13:09,030 --> 01:13:09,040

 

3089
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:11,270

but we need it here

3090
01:13:11,270 --> 01:13:11,280
but we need it here
 

3091
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:13,110
but we need it here
oh

3092

oh
 

3093
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:17,990
oh
it's just gonna kind of hold me back

3094
01:13:17,990 --> 01:13:18,000

 

3095
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:28,870

do i need to catch it while i'm flying

3096
01:13:28,870 --> 01:13:28,880

 

3097
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:30,870

no [\h__\h] way

01:13:30,870 --> 01:13:30,880
no [\h__\h] way
 

3099
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:33,189
no [\h__\h] way
how high am i gonna be

3100
01:13:33,189 --> 01:13:33,199
how high am i gonna be
 

3101
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:35,590
how high am i gonna be
uh flying anyway

3102
01:13:35,590 --> 01:13:35,600
uh flying anyway
 

3103
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:39,990
uh flying anyway
let's test it

3104
01:13:39,990 --> 01:13:40,000

 

3105
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,669

oh wait i don't need to i was thinking

3106
01:13:41,669 --> 01:13:41,679
oh wait i don't need to i was thinking
 

3107
01:13:41,679 --> 01:13:43,350
oh wait i don't need to i was thinking
you know while i'm flying maybe i'll

3108
01:13:43,350 --> 01:13:43,360
you know while i'm flying maybe i'll
 

3109
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:45,270
you know while i'm flying maybe i'll
fall through here and then fall through

3110
01:13:45,270 --> 01:13:45,280
fall through here and then fall through
 

3111
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:47,030
fall through here and then fall through
there and then land it on the other side

3112
01:13:47,030 --> 01:13:47,040
there and then land it on the other side
 

3113
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:48,709
there and then land it on the other side
again but

3114
01:13:48,709 --> 01:13:48,719
again but
 

3115
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:50,550
again but
yeah don't need to do it in one go i

3116
01:13:50,550 --> 01:13:50,560
yeah don't need to do it in one go i
 

3117
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:53,830
yeah don't need to do it in one go i
guess we can go back

3118
01:13:53,830 --> 01:13:53,840

 

3119
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:55,110

nice

3120
01:13:55,110 --> 01:13:55,120
nice
 

3121
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:56,950
nice
oh that's too easy i was thinking too

3122
01:13:56,950 --> 01:13:56,960
oh that's too easy i was thinking too
 

3123
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:58,390
oh that's too easy i was thinking too
complicated

3124
01:13:58,390 --> 01:13:58,400
complicated
 

3125
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,390
complicated
you are not breathing really

3126
01:14:00,390 --> 01:14:00,400
you are not breathing really
 

3127
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:03,350
you are not breathing really
it's too expensive to pump the spot down

3128
01:14:03,350 --> 01:14:03,360
it's too expensive to pump the spot down
 

3129
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,750
it's too expensive to pump the spot down
you just take carbon dioxide out of a

3130
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:05,760
you just take carbon dioxide out of a
 

3131
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:08,470
you just take carbon dioxide out of a
room freshen it up a little and pump it

3132
01:14:08,470 --> 01:14:08,480
room freshen it up a little and pump it
 

3133
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:09,669
room freshen it up a little and pump it
back in

3134
01:14:09,669 --> 01:14:09,679
back in
 

3135
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:11,669
back in
so you'll be breathing the same room

3136
01:14:11,669 --> 01:14:11,679
so you'll be breathing the same room
 

3137
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:14,470
so you'll be breathing the same room
full of air for the rest of your life i

so let me pour some water this water is

3148
01:14:27,350 --> 01:14:27,360
so let me pour some water this water is
 

3149
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:31,669
so let me pour some water this water is
not reused hopefully

3150

to do something with the laser i don't

3458
01:20:49,110 --> 01:20:49,120
to do something with the laser i don't
 

3459
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:50,950

oh maybe i need a new perspective by
 

3463
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,550
oh maybe i need a new perspective by
being on the cube no

3464
01:20:56,550 --> 01:20:56,560
being on the cube no
 

3465
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:57,910
being on the cube no
no

3466
01:20:57,910 --> 01:20:57,920
no
 

3467
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:02,950
no
these ones won't work stop the laser

3468
01:21:02,950 --> 01:21:02,960

 

3469
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:08,629

but if once the cube die one night

3470
01:21:08,629 --> 01:21:08,639

 

3471
01:21:08,639 --> 01:21:12,229

oh she took it away the moment i um

01:21:12,229 --> 01:21:12,239
oh she took it away the moment i um
 

3473
01:21:12,239 --> 01:21:14,149
oh she took it away the moment i um
i put the cube into the laser so i

3474
01:21:14,149 --> 01:21:14,159
i put the cube into the laser so i
 

3475
01:21:14,159 --> 01:21:17,830
i put the cube into the laser so i
thought that it can't handle the laser

3476
01:21:17,830 --> 01:21:17,840
thought that it can't handle the laser
 

3477
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:19,590
thought that it can't handle the laser
oh

3478
01:21:19,590 --> 01:21:19,600
oh
 

3479
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:22,709

3483
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:27,350
thought process of me i would say oh but
wait now i need to take it away because

01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:27,360
wait now i need to take it away because
 

3485
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:30,310
wait now i need to take it away because
otherwise the platform yeah okay

3692
01:26:36,870 --> 01:26:36,880
it over here and then the laser can go
 

3693
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:38,390
it over here and then the laser can go
through the um

3694
01:26:38,390 --> 01:26:38,400
through the um
 

3695
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:45,510

01:34:13,669 --> 01:34:13,679
let's do that let's do that
 

3993
01:34:13,679 --> 01:34:16,149
let's do that let's do that
ah wait i wasn't ready i wasn't ready

3994
01:34:16,149 --> 01:34:16,159
ah wait i wasn't ready i wasn't ready
 

3995
01:34:16,159 --> 01:34:17,590
ah wait i wasn't ready i wasn't ready
but okay

3996
01:34:17,590 --> 01:34:17,600
but okay

but okay
uh

3998
01:34:22,149 --> 01:34:22,159

01:34:22,159 --> 01:34:24,390

oh there's a cube dancing over there

4000
01:34:24,390 --> 01:34:24,400
oh there's a cube dancing over there
 

4001
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:26,470
oh there's a cube dancing over there
being played with we need to rescue the

4002
01:34:26,470 --> 01:34:26,480
being played with we need to rescue the
 

4003
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:28,950
being played with we need to rescue the
cube

4004
01:34:28,950 --> 01:34:28,960

 

4005
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:32,390

but how

4007
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:34,550

momentum

4008
01:34:34,550 --> 01:34:34,560

01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:36,229
momentum
momentum

4010
01:34:36,229 --> 01:34:36,239
momentum
 

4011
01:34:36,239 --> 01:34:39,030
momentum
so for example probably we'll have one

4012
01:34:39,030 --> 01:34:39,040
so for example probably we'll have one
 

4013
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:40,310
so for example probably we'll have one
here

4014
01:34:40,310 --> 01:34:40,320
here
 

4015
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:42,550
here
but the other one

4016
01:34:42,550 --> 01:34:42,560
but the other one
 

4017
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:43,830
but the other one
let me i

4018
01:34:43,830 --> 01:34:43,840

down there with a reflection cube is

4222
01:40:22,229 --> 01:40:22,239
down there with a reflection cube is
 

4223
01:40:22,239 --> 01:40:26,470
down there with a reflection cube is
that too am i thinking too far

4224
01:40:26,470 --> 01:40:26,480

 

4225
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:29,109

and then use that cube that i have down

4226
01:40:29,109 --> 01:40:29,119
and then use that cube that i have down
 

4227
01:40:29,119 --> 01:40:33,030
and then use that cube that i have down
there right now over there

4228

4229
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:34,709

because i just need a normal cube over

4230
01:40:34,709 --> 01:40:34,719
because i just need a normal cube over
 

4231
01:40:34,719 --> 01:40:39,270
because i just need a normal cube over
there is that am i thinking too deep

thinking of bridges

4882
01:58:49,750 --> 01:58:49,760
thinking of bridges
 

4883
01:58:49,760 --> 01:58:53,990
thinking of bridges
yeah we could lower it maybe like

4884
01:58:53,990 --> 01:58:54,000
yeah we could lower it maybe like
 

4885
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,550
yeah we could lower it maybe like
this

4886
01:58:56,550 --> 01:58:56,560

 

4887
01:58:56,560 --> 01:58:57,990

01:59:00,470 --> 01:59:00,480
or actually
 

4891
01:59:00,480 --> 01:59:03,270
or actually
considering that the height of this

4892
01:59:03,270 --> 01:59:03,280
considering that the height of this
 

4893
01:59:03,280 --> 01:59:04,470
considering that the height of this
platform

4894
01:59:04,470 --> 01:59:04,480
platform
 

4895
01:59:04,480 --> 01:59:07,430
platform
is where that line is

4896
01:59:07,430 --> 01:59:07,440
is where that line is
 

4897
01:59:07,440 --> 01:59:10,229
is where that line is
and the portal might go through like

4898
01:59:10,229 --> 01:59:10,239
and the portal might go through like
 

4899
01:59:10,239 --> 01:59:12,629
and the portal might go through like
around the middle or like more like the

4900
01:59:12,629 --> 01:59:12,639
around the middle or like more like the
 

4901
01:59:12,639 --> 01:59:15,270
around the middle or like more like the
bottom of the portal at the bridge might

4902
01:59:15,270 --> 01:59:15,280
bottom of the portal at the bridge might
 

4903
01:59:15,280 --> 01:59:19,750
bottom of the portal at the bridge might
go for the bottom of the portal

4904
01:59:19,750 --> 01:59:19,760

 

4905
01:59:19,760 --> 01:59:20,709

dangerous feeling you know living on
 

4925
01:59:44,960 --> 01:59:47,910
dangerous feeling you know living on
living on edge when you're on that

4926
01:59:47,910 --> 01:59:47,920
living on edge when you're on that
 

4927
01:59:47,920 --> 01:59:50,070
living on edge when you're on that
bridge that could disappear but not in

4928
01:59:50,070 --> 01:59:50,080
bridge that could disappear but not in
 

4929
01:59:50,080 --> 01:59:51,990
bridge that could disappear but not in
this case okay

4930

which
 

4935
01:59:57,040 --> 01:59:59,350
which
probably just we need a bridge again is

4936
01:59:59,350 --> 01:59:59,360
probably just we need a bridge again is
 

4937
01:59:59,360 --> 02:00:08,870
probably just we need a bridge again is
on this side of the platform

4938
02:00:08,870 --> 02:00:08,880

 

4939
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:10,870

um do we have to
 

6747
02:44:42,720 --> 02:44:45,510
um do we have to
play with momentum by any chance to get

that one is actually pretty easily

that one is actually pretty easily
 

6757
02:44:56,960 --> 02:44:58,710

ah nice to see you ah we can use these

6780
02:45:31,269 --> 02:45:31,279
ah nice to see you ah we can use these
 

6781
02:45:31,279 --> 02:45:32,389
ah nice to see you ah we can use these

is this how you're supposed to do it
like picking it up while you're falling

like picking it up while you're falling
 

6855
02:48:27,840 --> 02:48:29,990
like picking it up while you're falling
there and making a portal in that very

6856
02:48:29,990 --> 02:48:30,000
there and making a portal in that very
 

6857
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:31,830
there and making a portal in that very
same movement

6858
02:48:31,830 --> 02:48:31,840
same movement
 

6859
02:48:31,840 --> 02:48:35,750

once again we'll do the same thing

02:49:09,429 --> 02:49:09,439
once again we'll do the same thing
 

6887

once again we'll do the same thing
and then

6888
02:49:10,469 --> 02:49:10,479
and then
 

6889
02:49:10,479 --> 02:49:13,590
and then
i will make a portal um

6890
02:49:13,590 --> 02:49:13,600
i will make a portal um
 

6891
02:49:13,600 --> 02:49:14,389
i will make a portal um
or

7065
02:53:07,520 --> 02:53:11,510

huh

7066
02:53:11,510 --> 02:53:11,520

 

7067
02:53:11,520 --> 02:53:12,309

i

7068
02:53:12,309 --> 02:53:12,319
i
 

7069
02:53:12,319 --> 02:53:14,630
i
could for example do this

7070
02:53:14,630 --> 02:53:14,640
could for example do this
 

7071
02:53:14,640 --> 02:53:16,870
could for example do this
okay and then we have one activated but

7072
02:53:16,870 --> 02:53:16,880
okay and then we have one activated but
 

7073
02:53:16,880 --> 02:53:19,110
okay and then we have one activated but
i'm guessing we need the portals for

7074
02:53:19,110 --> 02:53:19,120
i'm guessing we need the portals for
 

7075
02:53:19,120 --> 02:53:21,190
i'm guessing we need the portals for
other things too

7076
02:53:21,190 --> 02:53:21,200
other things too
 

7077
02:53:21,200 --> 02:53:25,190
other things too
oh although

7078
02:53:25,190 --> 02:53:25,200

 

7079
02:53:25,200 --> 02:53:27,910

we could probably make one more i know

7080
02:53:27,910 --> 02:53:27,920
we could probably make one more i know
 

7081
02:53:27,920 --> 02:53:28,790
we could probably make one more i know
but

7082
02:53:28,790 --> 02:53:28,800
but
 

7083
02:53:28,800 --> 02:53:30,630
but
um

7084
02:53:30,630 --> 02:53:30,640
um
 

7085
02:53:30,640 --> 02:53:40,230
um
it's not a distributor

7086
02:53:40,230 --> 02:53:40,240

 

7087
02:53:40,240 --> 02:53:42,309

well that will be a little bit difficult

7088
02:53:42,309 --> 02:53:42,319
well that will be a little bit difficult
 

7089
02:53:42,319 --> 02:53:46,070
well that will be a little bit difficult
but i am confident

7090
02:53:46,070 --> 02:53:46,080

 

7091
02:53:46,080 --> 02:53:48,790

03:26:59,269 --> 03:26:59,279
a computer
 

8611
03:26:59,279 --> 03:27:00,870

why do i need to look at the implosion

8626
03:27:19,990 --> 03:27:20,000
why do i need to look at the implosion
 

8627
03:27:20,000 --> 03:27:24,309

03:27:29,830 --> 03:27:29,840
might need the laser after all
 

8633
03:27:29,840 --> 03:27:31,110

moment of playing portal 1
 

9491
03:48:54,160 --> 03:48:56,469
moment of playing portal 1
that the portals don't work on every

uh okay i see we're probably gonna play
 

9579
03:51:03,520 --> 03:51:06,870
uh okay i see we're probably gonna play
with momentum here

9580
03:51:06,870 --> 03:51:06,880

 

9581
03:51:06,880 --> 03:51:11,750

on this platform yeah probably maybe the
 

9591
03:51:22,160 --> 03:51:23,830
on this platform yeah probably maybe the
door can open

9592
03:51:23,830 --> 03:51:23,840
door can open
 

9593
03:51:23,840 --> 03:51:24,870
