you didn't need it why did they have it

14371
06:27:09,270 --> 06:27:09,280
you didn't need it why did they have it
 

14372
06:27:09,280 --> 06:27:10,788
you didn't need it why did they have it
i guess maybe they just collected it

14373
06:27:10,788 --> 06:27:10,798
i guess maybe they just collected it
 

14374
06:27:10,798 --> 06:27:13,270
i guess maybe they just collected it
because you get it in the forest

14375
06:27:13,270 --> 06:27:13,280
because you get it in the forest
 

14376
06:27:13,280 --> 06:27:14,788
because you get it in the forest
and maybe they probably already knew

14377
06:27:14,788 --> 06:27:14,798
and maybe they probably already knew
 

14378
06:27:14,798 --> 06:27:15,910
and maybe they probably already knew
that you need it later when you're

14379
06:27:15,910 --> 06:27:15,920
that you need it later when you're
