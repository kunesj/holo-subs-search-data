hour streams

2992
01:30:26,149 --> 01:30:26,159
hour streams
 

2993
01:30:26,159 --> 01:30:27,990
hour streams
not because she doesn't have the stamina

2994
01:30:27,990 --> 01:30:28,000
not because she doesn't have the stamina
 

2995
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,590
not because she doesn't have the stamina
but more like because she doesn't

2996
01:30:29,590 --> 01:30:29,600
but more like because she doesn't
 

2997
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:31,350
but more like because she doesn't
she probably doesn't have the time to do

2998
01:30:31,350 --> 01:30:31,360
she probably doesn't have the time to do
 

2999
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:33,189
she probably doesn't have the time to do
it

3000
01:30:33,189 --> 01:30:33,199
it
 

3001
01:30:33,199 --> 01:30:33,830
it
win by default

3002
01:30:33,830 --> 01:30:33,840
win by default
 

3003
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:36,470

01:30:36,470 --> 01:30:36,480
[Laughter]
 

3005
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:41,110
[Laughter]
yeah but i think i think it would be fun

3006
01:30:41,110 --> 01:30:41,120
yeah but i think i think it would be fun
 

3007
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:42,709
yeah but i think i think it would be fun
it's like we talked about it yesterday

3008
01:30:42,709 --> 01:30:42,719
it's like we talked about it yesterday
 

3009
01:30:42,719 --> 01:30:44,470
it's like we talked about it yesterday
in the animal crossing stream that there

3010
01:30:44,470 --> 01:30:44,480
in the animal crossing stream that there
 

3011
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:46,149
in the animal crossing stream that there
is not

3012
01:30:46,149 --> 01:30:46,159
is not
 

3013
01:30:46,159 --> 01:30:48,629
is not
much you can do collaboration wise for

3014
01:30:48,629 --> 01:30:48,639
much you can do collaboration wise for
 

3015
01:30:48,639 --> 01:30:50,070
much you can do collaboration wise for
streams

3016
01:30:50,070 --> 01:30:50,080
streams
 

3017
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:57,110
streams
but these challenges could be an idea

3018
01:30:57,110 --> 01:30:57,120

 

3019
01:30:57,120 --> 01:31:00,149

so that might be fun she also doesn't

3020
01:31:00,149 --> 01:31:00,159
so that might be fun she also doesn't
 

3021
01:31:00,159 --> 01:31:04,790
so that might be fun she also doesn't
have stamina

3022
01:31:04,790 --> 01:31:04,800

 

3023
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:06,550

okay well so she doesn't have time and

3024
01:31:06,550 --> 01:31:06,560
okay well so she doesn't have time and
 

3025
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:08,629
okay well so she doesn't have time and
she doesn't have stamina

3026
01:31:08,629 --> 01:31:08,639
she doesn't have stamina
 

3027
01:31:08,639 --> 01:31:12,709
she doesn't have stamina
sounds like a default win for me

3028
01:31:12,709 --> 01:31:12,719

 

3029
01:31:12,719 --> 01:31:16,149
