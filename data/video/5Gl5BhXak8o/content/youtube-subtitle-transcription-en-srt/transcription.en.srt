oh is the main gotcha we're doing so go

818
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:04,320
oh is the main gotcha we're doing so go
 

819
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,669
oh is the main gotcha we're doing so go
to the shop summons

820
00:20:05,669 --> 00:20:05,679
to the shop summons
 

821
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,110

star summons so basically you get one of
 

825
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,870
star summons so basically you get one of
five characters

826
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:12,880
five characters
 

827
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,430
five characters
chosen by you and now we'll try to use

828
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:15,440
chosen by you and now we'll try to use
 

829
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,350
chosen by you and now we'll try to use
that

830
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:17,360
that
 

831
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,270
that
exactly we'll use the character that we

832
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:19,280
exactly we'll use the character that we
 

833
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,350
