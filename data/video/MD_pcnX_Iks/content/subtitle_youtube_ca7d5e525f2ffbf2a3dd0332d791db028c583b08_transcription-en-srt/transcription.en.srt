and then we brought them home and uh we
 

4381
02:00:21,599 --> 02:00:24,830
and then we brought them home and uh we
tried we wanted to originally we wanted

4382
02:00:24,830 --> 02:00:24,840
tried we wanted to originally we wanted
 

4383
02:00:24,840 --> 02:00:27,229
tried we wanted to originally we wanted
to attach all of
