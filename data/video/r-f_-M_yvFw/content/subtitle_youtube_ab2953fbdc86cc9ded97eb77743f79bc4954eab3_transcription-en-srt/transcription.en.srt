what the before um today's stream I

1060
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:46,000
what the before um today's stream I
 

1061
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,470
what the before um today's stream I
was like prepping everything for today's

1062
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:48,480
was like prepping everything for today's
 

1063
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,430
was like prepping everything for today's
3D live and also we had a little test

1064
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:52,440
3D live and also we had a little test
 

1065
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:56,029
3D live and also we had a little test
for 7 days to die and also they came up

1066
00:32:56,029 --> 00:32:56,039
for 7 days to die and also they came up
 

1067
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:57,870
for 7 days to die and also they came up
with a schedule that is a little a

1068
00:32:57,870 --> 00:32:57,880
with a schedule that is a little a
 

1069
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,549
with a schedule that is a little a
little bit better for me a little bit

1070
00:32:59,549 --> 00:32:59,559
little bit better for me a little bit
 

1071
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:01,470
little bit better for me a little bit
more bearable so that it's not like

1072
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:01,480
more bearable so that it's not like
 

1073
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,470
more bearable so that it's not like
starting at 4:00 a.m. each day my time I

1074
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:04,480
starting at 4:00 a.m. each day my time I
 

1075
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,230
starting at 4:00 a.m. each day my time I
think it's more like starting at 2: a.m.

1076
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:06,240
think it's more like starting at 2: a.m.
 

1077
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,990
think it's more like starting at 2: a.m.
and then also there's a different slot

1078
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:08,000
and then also there's a different slot
 

1079
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,149
and then also there's a different slot
for like 10 10: p.m. my time or so

1080
00:33:11,149 --> 00:33:11,159
for like 10 10: p.m. my time or so
 

1081
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:13,430
for like 10 10: p.m. my time or so
something like that or or was it I don't

1082
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:13,440
something like that or or was it I don't
 

1083
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,310
something like that or or was it I don't
know but um they've made it a little bit

1084
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:16,320
know but um they've made it a little bit
 

1085
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,509
know but um they've made it a little bit
better for the Europeans

1086
00:33:18,509 --> 00:33:18,519
better for the Europeans
 

1087
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:22,070
better for the Europeans
so um and I don't have to participate in

1088
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:22,080
so um and I don't have to participate in
 

1089
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,629
so um and I don't have to participate in
every time slot but I'll probably be

1090
00:33:24,629 --> 00:33:24,639
every time slot but I'll probably be
 

1091
00:33:24,639 --> 00:33:26,549
every time slot but I'll probably be
generally aiming for

1092
00:33:26,549 --> 00:33:26,559
generally aiming for
 

1093
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:29,110
generally aiming for
the uh not in the middle of the

1094
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:29,120
the uh not in the middle of the
 

1095
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,230
the uh not in the middle of the
nighttime slots except for the F the the

1096
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:31,240
nighttime slots except for the F the the
 

1097
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:37,669
nighttime slots except for the F the the
first stream I think I W to be there and

1098
00:33:37,669 --> 00:33:37,679
first stream I think I W to be there and
 

1099
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,029
first stream I think I W to be there and
my sleep schedule is still kind of

1100
00:33:39,029 --> 00:33:39,039
my sleep schedule is still kind of
 

1101
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,870
my sleep schedule is still kind of
 right now anyway so why not make

1102
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:40,880
right now anyway so why not make
 

1103
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,389
right now anyway so why not make
use of it but then I'll gradually

1104
00:33:45,389 --> 00:33:45,399

 

1105
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:48,909

probably turn towards the more European

1106
00:33:48,909 --> 00:33:48,919
probably turn towards the more European
 

1107
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:52,269
probably turn towards the more European
friendly times slash it's g no actually

1108
00:33:52,269 --> 00:33:52,279

I don't know N I don't want to risk it
but if you can mix the fruits with the

2216
01:05:32,630 --> 01:05:32,640
but if you can mix the fruits with the
 

2217
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:34,230
but if you can mix the fruits with the
salt then you can probably also mix the

2218
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:34,240
salt then you can probably also mix the
 

2219
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:39,069
salt then you can probably also mix the
pepper with the salt

2220
01:05:39,069 --> 01:05:39,079

 

2221
01:05:39,079 --> 01:05:42,150

right um I wouldn't be too sure about

2222
01:05:42,150 --> 01:05:42,160
right um I wouldn't be too sure about
 

2223
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:45,109
right um I wouldn't be too sure about
that but the pepper with the milk

01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:49,430
that but the pepper with the milk
maybe P Peppa with the milk spicy milk

maybe P Peppa with the milk spicy milk
 

2227
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:52,349
maybe P Peppa with the milk spicy milk
makes sense

2228
01:05:52,349 --> 01:05:52,359

 

2229
01:05:52,359 --> 01:05:57,470

right spicy milk makes sense

2230
01:05:57,470 --> 01:05:57,480

 

2231
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:01,710
