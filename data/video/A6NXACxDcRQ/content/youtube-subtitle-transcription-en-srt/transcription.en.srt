1058
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:39,620

 

1059
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,870

00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,149
over 100 confused I think I saw that
clip they clipped they they cut out a

00:28:47,149 --> 00:28:47,159
clip they clipped they they cut out a
 

1065
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:48,409

little bit I think it wasn't like the
 

1067
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:51,310
little bit I think it wasn't like the
complete thing right

1068
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:51,320
complete thing right
 

1069
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:59,510
complete thing right
but yeah I thought yeah

1070
00:28:59,510 --> 00:28:59,520

 

1071
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,730

um good advertisement for me

1072
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:01,740

1076
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:07,140
but if they um
 

1077
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,049
but if they um
yeah from what I saw I think that that

1078
00:29:09,049 --> 00:29:09,059
yeah from what I saw I think that that
 

1079
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:12,169
yeah from what I saw I think that that
they cut something but not much so it's

1080
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:12,179
they cut something but not much so it's
 

1081
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:14,029
they cut something but not much so it's
like it doesn't really leave you with
