3233
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:23,750
$92 we got fin for your death what the
heck oh but where

3234
01:25:23,750 --> 01:25:23,760
heck oh but where
 

3235
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:27,709
heck oh but where
is okay let's see so Pomo died

3236
01:25:27,709 --> 01:25:27,719
is okay let's see so Pomo died
 

3237
01:25:27,719 --> 01:25:30,950
is okay let's see so Pomo died
unnecessarily

3238
01:25:30,950 --> 01:25:30,960

 

3239
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:33,030

twice yeah

3240
01:25:33,030 --> 01:25:33,040
twice yeah
 

3241
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:35,709
twice yeah
great but it's okay cuz every time that

3242
01:25:35,709 --> 01:25:35,719
great but it's okay cuz every time that
 

3243
01:25:35,719 --> 01:25:37,270
great but it's okay cuz every time that
you disconnected it didn't count as a

3244
01:25:37,270 --> 01:25:37,280
you disconnected it didn't count as a
 

3245
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:39,430
you disconnected it didn't count as a
dead so we didn't get charge so it's

3246
01:25:39,430 --> 01:25:39,440
dead so we didn't get charge so it's
 

3247
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:43,189
dead so we didn't get charge so it's
just making up for it making up logic

3248
01:25:43,189 --> 01:25:43,199
just making up for it making up logic
 

3249
01:25:43,199 --> 01:25:45,870
just making up for it making up logic
okay yeah yeah logic checks out girl M

3250
01:25:45,870 --> 01:25:45,880
okay yeah yeah logic checks out girl M
 

3251
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:49,149
