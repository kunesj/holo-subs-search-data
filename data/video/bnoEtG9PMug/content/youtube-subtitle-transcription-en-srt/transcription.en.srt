of
 

1185
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,570
of
slowly growing and not instantly just

1186
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:50,580
slowly growing and not instantly just
 

1187
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,010
slowly growing and not instantly just
trying to take off and spend all my

1188

1189
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:55,850
trying to take off and spend all my
money it was incredibly difficult to

1190
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:55,860
money it was incredibly difficult to
 

1191
00:29:55,860 --> 00:30:00,909
money it was incredibly difficult to
learn everything

1192

1193
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:03,649

of people make is they throw in money to

1196
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:06,360
of people make is they throw in money to
 

1197
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,870
of people make is they throw in money to
get the best model they possibly can and

1198
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:08,880
get the best model they possibly can and
 

1199
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,669
get the best model they possibly can and
it goes down the drain because maybe

1200
00:30:10,669 --> 00:30:10,679
it goes down the drain because maybe
 

1201
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:12,590
it goes down the drain because maybe

01:15:05,030 --> 01:15:05,040
and when I thought about it that was the
 

3397

and um actually no a bit less I'd say

3410
01:15:19,189 --> 01:15:19,199
and um actually no a bit less I'd say
 

3411
01:15:19,199 --> 01:15:21,530
and um actually no a bit less I'd say
it's half of it because then when I

3458
01:16:29,030 --> 01:16:29,040
but again because I'm in Canada it's
 

3459
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:30,229
but again because I'm in Canada it's
actually a lot more expensive than that

01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:40,729
the reason why I was willing to spend
that much is because I saved up that

was very very timid about it
 

8431
03:01:37,260 --> 03:01:40,910
was very very timid about it
I was a streamer for over like about a

8432
03:01:40,910 --> 03:01:40,920
I was a streamer for over like about a
 

8433
03:01:40,920 --> 03:01:45,590
I was a streamer for over like about a
year until I was willing to tell my mom

8434
03:01:45,590 --> 03:01:45,600
year until I was willing to tell my mom
 

8435
03:01:45,600 --> 03:01:47,750
year until I was willing to tell my mom
that I was a streamer

03:01:47,750 --> 03:01:47,760
that I was a streamer
 

8437
03:01:47,760 --> 03:01:49,910
that I was a streamer
because I wanted to work hard for it to

8438
03:01:49,910 --> 03:01:49,920
because I wanted to work hard for it to
 

8439
03:01:49,920 --> 03:01:52,090
because I wanted to work hard for it to
show her that I put the time and effort

8440
03:01:52,090 --> 03:01:52,100
show her that I put the time and effort
 

8441
03:01:52,100 --> 03:01:55,190
show her that I put the time and effort
into something that's totally different

8442
03:01:55,190 --> 03:01:55,200
into something that's totally different
 

8443
03:01:55,200 --> 03:01:58,309
into something that's totally different
from what I normally do I didn't want to

8444
03:01:58,309 --> 03:01:58,319
from what I normally do I didn't want to
 

8445
03:01:58,319 --> 03:01:59,870
from what I normally do I didn't want to
spring it on her out of nowhere like hey

8446
03:01:59,870 --> 03:01:59,880
spring it on her out of nowhere like hey
 

8447
03:01:59,880 --> 03:02:02,269
spring it on her out of nowhere like hey
Mom I'm gonna become a streamer look at

8448
03:02:02,269 --> 03:02:02,279
Mom I'm gonna become a streamer look at
 

8449
03:02:02,279 --> 03:02:04,010
Mom I'm gonna become a streamer look at
this because then she would definitely

8450
03:02:04,010 --> 03:02:04,020
this because then she would definitely
 

8451
03:02:04,020 --> 03:02:05,990
this because then she would definitely
say okay you're wasting your time don't

8452
03:02:05,990 --> 03:02:06,000
say okay you're wasting your time don't
 

8453
03:02:06,000 --> 03:02:08,030
say okay you're wasting your time don't
do that you're starting something that

8454
03:02:08,030 --> 03:02:08,040
do that you're starting something that
 

8455
03:02:08,040 --> 03:02:09,830
do that you're starting something that
you totally don't know anything about

8456
03:02:09,830 --> 03:02:09,840
you totally don't know anything about
 

8457
03:02:09,840 --> 03:02:11,510
you totally don't know anything about
why would you do that

8458
03:02:11,510 --> 03:02:11,520
why would you do that
 

8459
03:02:11,520 --> 03:02:14,150
why would you do that
so

8460
03:02:14,150 --> 03:02:14,160
so
 

8461
03:02:14,160 --> 03:02:16,610
so
the fact that I spent the time to build

8462
03:02:16,610 --> 03:02:16,620
the fact that I spent the time to build
 

8463
03:02:16,620 --> 03:02:18,290
the fact that I spent the time to build
it up before telling her was probably

8464
03:02:18,290 --> 03:02:18,300
it up before telling her was probably
 

8465
03:02:18,300 --> 03:02:22,190
it up before telling her was probably
one of the best decisions I ever made

8466
03:02:22,190 --> 03:02:22,200

 

8467
03:02:22,200 --> 03:02:25,130

music

8468
03:02:25,130 --> 03:02:25,140
music
 

8469

after the raid which is why I tried very

12785
04:32:00,229 --> 04:32:00,239
after the raid which is why I tried very
 

12786
04:32:00,239 --> 04:32:01,969

raided

12791
04:32:06,229 --> 04:32:06,239
raided
 

12792
04:32:06,239 --> 04:32:09,769
raided
I tried very very very very very hard

12793
04:32:09,769 --> 04:32:09,779

12796
04:32:12,180 --> 04:32:13,610
you kept about 100 people yeah I did
because I know after the raid people

12797
04:32:13,610 --> 04:32:13,620
because I know after the raid people
 

12798
04:32:13,620 --> 04:32:18,349
because I know after the raid people
instantly leave but 150 people stayed

12799
04:32:18,349 --> 04:32:18,359
instantly leave but 150 people stayed

04:32:18,359 --> 04:32:21,649
instantly leave but 150 people stayed
I never thought that I could keep 150

12801
04:32:21,649 --> 04:32:21,659
I never thought that I could keep 150
 

12802

people entertained for four hours I
think that stream was four hours

12805
04:32:27,769 --> 04:32:27,779
think that stream was four hours
 

12806
04:32:27,779 --> 04:32:29,410
think that stream was four hours
so

on my OBS as well but I do it in like a
different profile uh so it's vertical

15177
05:22:02,448 --> 05:22:02,458
different profile uh so it's vertical
 

15178
05:22:02,458 --> 05:22:05,448
different profile uh so it's vertical
that way it keeps all the uh pixels and
