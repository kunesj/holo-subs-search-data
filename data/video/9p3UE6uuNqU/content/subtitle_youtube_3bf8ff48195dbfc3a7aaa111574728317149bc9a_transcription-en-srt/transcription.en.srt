one-on-one or a five on five meeting
 

3035
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:47,750

huh
 

3039
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:53,390
huh
I think

3040
01:15:53,390 --> 01:15:53,400

 

3041
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:55,970

I feel like Iris maybe got introduced

01:15:55,970 --> 01:15:55,980
I feel like Iris maybe got introduced
 

3043
01:15:55,980 --> 01:15:58,430
I feel like Iris maybe got introduced
earlier

01:15:58,430 --> 01:15:58,440
earlier
 

3045
01:15:58,440 --> 01:16:01,310
earlier
but then

3046
01:16:01,310 --> 01:16:01,320
but then
 

3047
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:04,910
but then
we I think suddenly they were

3048
01:16:04,910 --> 01:16:04,920
we I think suddenly they were
 

3049
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:07,490
we I think suddenly they were
added to our Discord because before that

3050
01:16:07,490 --> 01:16:07,500
added to our Discord because before that
 

3051
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:11,870
added to our Discord because before that
they had like a separate one

3052
01:16:11,870 --> 01:16:11,880

 

3053
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:13,510

I mean like

3054
01:16:13,510 --> 01:16:13,520
I mean like
 

3055
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:16,729
I mean like
yeah I think I think

3056
01:16:16,729 --> 01:16:16,739
yeah I think I think
 

3057
01:16:16,739 --> 01:16:19,070
yeah I think I think
they're suddenly there

3058
01:16:19,070 --> 01:16:19,080
they're suddenly there
 

3059
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:21,050
they're suddenly there
and then I guess

3060
01:16:21,050 --> 01:16:21,060
and then I guess
 

3061
01:16:21,060 --> 01:16:25,610
and then I guess
we were I don't even remember that time

3062
01:16:25,610 --> 01:16:25,620

3069
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:42,590

maybe maybe I'm just imagining things

3070
01:16:42,590 --> 01:16:42,600

 

3071
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:47,030

7345
03:03:36,050 --> 03:03:36,060
I was using like watercolor
 

7346
03:03:36,060 --> 03:03:39,230
I was using like watercolor
and for the oh the face blush you know

7347
03:03:39,230 --> 03:03:39,240
and for the oh the face blush you know
 

7348
03:03:39,240 --> 03:03:40,730
and for the oh the face blush you know
watercolor the problem with the

7349
03:03:40,730 --> 03:03:40,740
watercolor the problem with the
 

7350
03:03:40,740 --> 03:03:43,070
watercolor the problem with the
watercolor brush because I bought it off

7351
03:03:43,070 --> 03:03:43,080
watercolor brush because I bought it off
 

7352

watercolor brush because I bought it off
screen you guys don't even haven't even

7353
03:03:44,809 --> 03:03:44,819
screen you guys don't even haven't even
 

7354
03:03:44,819 --> 03:03:47,269
screen you guys don't even haven't even
seen it in action I think

7355
03:03:47,269 --> 03:03:47,279
seen it in action I think
 

7356
03:03:47,279 --> 03:03:48,889
seen it in action I think
but the problem with it is you can't

7357
03:03:48,889 --> 03:03:48,899
but the problem with it is you can't
 

7358
03:03:48,899 --> 03:03:51,830
but the problem with it is you can't
control where it goes really well

7359
03:03:51,830 --> 03:03:51,840
control where it goes really well
 

7360
03:03:51,840 --> 03:03:54,889
control where it goes really well
um you may get a certain size and then

7361
03:03:54,889 --> 03:03:54,899
um you may get a certain size and then
 

7362
03:03:54,899 --> 03:03:57,349
um you may get a certain size and then
within that right radius it will

7363
03:03:57,349 --> 03:03:57,359
within that right radius it will
 

7364
03:03:57,359 --> 03:03:59,870
within that right radius it will
sprinkle it randomly

7365
03:03:59,870 --> 03:03:59,880
sprinkle it randomly
 

7366
03:03:59,880 --> 03:04:01,730
sprinkle it randomly
but even the smallest size you can make

7367
03:04:01,730 --> 03:04:01,740
but even the smallest size you can make
 

7368
03:04:01,740 --> 03:04:04,730
but even the smallest size you can make
it is pretty big so it will still not

7369
03:04:04,730 --> 03:04:04,740
it is pretty big so it will still not
 

7370
03:04:04,740 --> 03:04:07,670
it is pretty big so it will still not
have much control over where it goes

7371
03:04:07,670 --> 03:04:07,680
have much control over where it goes
 

7372
03:04:07,680 --> 03:04:10,130
have much control over where it goes
it like for example

7373
03:04:10,130 --> 03:04:10,140
it like for example
 

7374
03:04:10,140 --> 03:04:13,250
it like for example
like if you press it

7375
03:04:13,250 --> 03:04:13,260
like if you press it
 

7376
03:04:13,260 --> 03:04:15,469
like if you press it
you put it down if you press it for like

7377
03:04:15,469 --> 03:04:15,479
you put it down if you press it for like
 

7378
03:04:15,479 --> 03:04:18,530
you put it down if you press it for like
five seconds but you stay in the same

7379
03:04:18,530 --> 03:04:18,540
five seconds but you stay in the same
 

7380
03:04:18,540 --> 03:04:20,750
five seconds but you stay in the same
spot basically it will sprinkle it like

7381
03:04:20,750 --> 03:04:20,760
spot basically it will sprinkle it like
 

7382
03:04:20,760 --> 03:04:22,490
spot basically it will sprinkle it like
everywhere within that radius like one

7383
03:04:22,490 --> 03:04:22,500
everywhere within that radius like one
 

7384
03:04:22,500 --> 03:04:24,650
everywhere within that radius like one
left one right one down there one up

7385
03:04:24,650 --> 03:04:24,660
left one right one down there one up
 

7386
03:04:24,660 --> 03:04:26,929
left one right one down there one up
here and so on you know what I mean

it as long as you don't use it for a

7397
03:04:43,130 --> 03:04:43,140
it as long as you don't use it for a
 

7398
03:04:43,140 --> 03:04:45,110
