I ended up not doing it because even
 

8943
04:22:42,600 --> 04:22:43,910
I ended up not doing it because even
though

8944
04:22:43,910 --> 04:22:43,920
though
 

8945
04:22:43,920 --> 04:22:46,189
though
I I asked Steph I was like is it okay to

8946
04:22:46,189 --> 04:22:46,199
I I asked Steph I was like is it okay to
 

8947
04:22:46,199 --> 04:22:47,630
I I asked Steph I was like is it okay to
do it because it's the only song that

8948
04:22:47,630 --> 04:22:47,640
do it because it's the only song that
 

8949
04:22:47,640 --> 04:22:50,090
do it because it's the only song that
doesn't have a guide maybe not

8950
04:22:50,090 --> 04:22:50,100
doesn't have a guide maybe not
 

8951
04:22:50,100 --> 04:22:52,610
doesn't have a guide maybe not
necessarily it hints at me doing it at

8952
04:22:52,610 --> 04:22:52,620
necessarily it hints at me doing it at
 

8953
04:22:52,620 --> 04:22:54,050
necessarily it hints at me doing it at
the concert and they were like yeah

8954
04:22:54,050 --> 04:22:54,060
the concert and they were like yeah
 

8955
04:22:54,060 --> 04:22:55,429
the concert and they were like yeah
that's fine

8956
04:22:55,429 --> 04:22:55,439
that's fine
 

8957
04:22:55,439 --> 04:22:58,729
that's fine
listen it's fun even though they also

8958
04:22:58,729 --> 04:22:58,739
listen it's fun even though they also
 

8959
04:22:58,739 --> 04:23:01,130
listen it's fun even though they also
said very clearly do not hint at the set

8960
04:23:01,130 --> 04:23:01,140
said very clearly do not hint at the set
 

8961
04:23:01,140 --> 04:23:01,969
said very clearly do not hint at the set
list

8962
04:23:01,969 --> 04:23:01,979
list
 

8963
04:23:01,979 --> 04:23:05,510
list
of the concert in any way

8964
04:23:05,510 --> 04:23:05,520
of the concert in any way
 

8965
04:23:05,520 --> 04:23:07,610
of the concert in any way
so

8966
04:23:07,610 --> 04:23:07,620
so
 

8967
04:23:07,620 --> 04:23:09,950
so
however that I mean that was obviously

8968
04:23:09,950 --> 04:23:09,960
however that I mean that was obviously
 

8969
04:23:09,960 --> 04:23:11,870
however that I mean that was obviously
clear but I was like reminded of it

8970
04:23:11,870 --> 04:23:11,880
clear but I was like reminded of it
 

8971
04:23:11,880 --> 04:23:13,130
clear but I was like reminded of it
later on

8972
04:23:13,130 --> 04:23:13,140
later on
 

8973
04:23:13,140 --> 04:23:17,269
later on
before I was gonna do the the video

8974
04:23:17,269 --> 04:23:17,279
before I was gonna do the the video
 

8975
04:23:17,279 --> 04:23:19,189
before I was gonna do the the video
and then I kind of chickened out and was

8976
04:23:19,189 --> 04:23:19,199
and then I kind of chickened out and was
 

8977
04:23:19,199 --> 04:23:21,590
and then I kind of chickened out and was
like maybe I shouldn't do it

8978
04:23:21,590 --> 04:23:21,600
like maybe I shouldn't do it
 

8979
04:23:21,600 --> 04:23:25,969
like maybe I shouldn't do it
because if I do it before the concerts

8980
04:23:25,969 --> 04:23:25,979
because if I do it before the concerts
 

8981
04:23:25,979 --> 04:23:28,910
because if I do it before the concerts
well that would be ideal but at the same

8982
04:23:28,910 --> 04:23:28,920
well that would be ideal but at the same
 

8983
04:23:28,920 --> 04:23:32,570
well that would be ideal but at the same
time I'm obviously like hinting at it

8984
04:23:32,570 --> 04:23:32,580
time I'm obviously like hinting at it
 

8985
04:23:32,580 --> 04:23:34,309
time I'm obviously like hinting at it
yeah so I was like maybe it's better

8986
04:23:34,309 --> 04:23:34,319
yeah so I was like maybe it's better
 

8987
04:23:34,319 --> 04:23:35,929
yeah so I was like maybe it's better
before I get bonked even though they

8988
04:23:35,929 --> 04:23:35,939
before I get bonked even though they
 

8989
04:23:35,939 --> 04:23:38,510
before I get bonked even though they
said I could do it Ian management said I

8990
04:23:38,510 --> 04:23:38,520
said I could do it Ian management said I
 

8991
04:23:38,520 --> 04:23:41,510
said I could do it Ian management said I
could do it but before I get bonked I

8992
04:23:41,510 --> 04:23:41,520
could do it but before I get bonked I
 

8993
04:23:41,520 --> 04:23:42,710
could do it but before I get bonked I
was like

8994
04:23:42,710 --> 04:23:42,720
was like
 

8995
04:23:42,720 --> 04:23:44,630
was like
I better not do it and you know what in

8996
04:23:44,630 --> 04:23:44,640
I better not do it and you know what in
 

8997
04:23:44,640 --> 04:23:46,309
I better not do it and you know what in
hindsight even if I had done it I don't

8998
04:23:46,309 --> 04:23:46,319
hindsight even if I had done it I don't
 

8999
04:23:46,319 --> 04:23:48,830
hindsight even if I had done it I don't
think so many people would have really

9000
04:23:48,830 --> 04:23:48,840
think so many people would have really
 

9001
04:23:48,840 --> 04:23:51,229
think so many people would have really
like seen it and followed followed on

9002
04:23:51,229 --> 04:23:51,239
like seen it and followed followed on
 

9003
04:23:51,239 --> 04:23:54,530
like seen it and followed followed on
doing it

9004
04:23:54,530 --> 04:23:54,540

 

9005
04:23:54,540 --> 04:23:56,990

because well

9006
04:23:56,990 --> 04:23:57,000
because well
 

9007
04:23:57,000 --> 04:23:58,490
because well
it's hard to reach

9008
04:23:58,490 --> 04:23:58,500
it's hard to reach
 

9009
04:23:58,500 --> 04:24:00,710
it's hard to reach
thousands and thousands of people who

9010
04:24:00,710 --> 04:24:00,720
thousands and thousands of people who
 

9011
04:24:00,720 --> 04:24:03,469
thousands and thousands of people who
are not necessarily at all my fan base

9012
04:24:03,469 --> 04:24:03,479
are not necessarily at all my fan base
 

9013
04:24:03,479 --> 04:24:05,929
are not necessarily at all my fan base
to do it

9014
04:24:05,929 --> 04:24:05,939
to do it
 

9015
04:24:05,939 --> 04:24:09,469
to do it
so I thought it's probably gonna be fine

9016
04:24:09,469 --> 04:24:09,479
so I thought it's probably gonna be fine
 

9017
04:24:09,479 --> 04:24:11,610
so I thought it's probably gonna be fine
I will make one yeah

9018

9063
04:25:14,660 --> 04:25:17,750

we just have 10 members

9064
04:25:17,750 --> 04:25:17,760
we just have 10 members
 

9065
04:25:17,760 --> 04:25:21,349
we just have 10 members
and on the big four Fest there were way

9066
04:25:21,349 --> 04:25:21,359
and on the big four Fest there were way
 

9067

more members

well maybe take a look
 

9075
04:25:31,199 --> 04:25:33,229
well maybe take a look
at the guides and honestly I feel like

for a while I just stopped and was like
 

12119
05:46:35,820 --> 05:46:37,788
for a while I just stopped and was like
Hey did I run out of time or but wait

12120

12129
05:46:46,440 --> 05:46:48,650
really and that made me doubt it like
maybe we shouldn't and then I tried to

12130
05:46:48,650 --> 05:46:48,660
maybe we shouldn't and then I tried to
 

12131
05:46:48,660 --> 05:46:50,570
maybe we shouldn't and then I tried to
install a little bit more but then I was

12132
05:46:50,570 --> 05:46:50,580
install a little bit more but then I was
 

12133
05:46:50,580 --> 05:46:53,868
install a little bit more but then I was
kind of like scared again because I I

12134
05:46:53,868 --> 05:46:53,878
kind of like scared again because I I
 

12135
05:46:53,878 --> 05:46:55,970
kind of like scared again because I I
was because the another problem was like

12136
05:46:55,970 --> 05:46:55,980
was because the another problem was like
 

12137
05:46:55,980 --> 05:46:58,310
was because the another problem was like
if we were talking in English most of

12138
05:46:58,310 --> 05:46:58,320
if we were talking in English most of
 

12139
05:46:58,320 --> 05:47:01,850
if we were talking in English most of
the time I mean generally always but the

12140
05:47:01,850 --> 05:47:01,860
the time I mean generally always but the
 

12141
05:47:01,860 --> 05:47:03,350
the time I mean generally always but the
staff

12142
05:47:03,350 --> 05:47:03,360
staff
 

12143
05:47:03,360 --> 05:47:06,230
staff
I mean Yen staff was somewhere there but

12144
05:47:06,230 --> 05:47:06,240
I mean Yen staff was somewhere there but
 

12145
05:47:06,240 --> 05:47:07,850
I mean Yen staff was somewhere there but
the staff who were in control of like

12146
05:47:07,850 --> 05:47:07,860
the staff who were in control of like
 

12147
05:47:07,860 --> 05:47:10,548
the staff who were in control of like
switching scenes and all of that were

12148
05:47:10,548 --> 05:47:10,558
switching scenes and all of that were
 

12149
05:47:10,558 --> 05:47:13,310
switching scenes and all of that were
all Japanese speaking and I don't think

12150
05:47:13,310 --> 05:47:13,320
all Japanese speaking and I don't think
 

12151
05:47:13,320 --> 05:47:15,970
all Japanese speaking and I don't think
they understand much English

12152
05:47:15,970 --> 05:47:15,980
they understand much English
 

12153
05:47:15,980 --> 05:47:22,670
they understand much English
so you know I was trying to hint that um

12154
05:47:22,670 --> 05:47:22,680

 

12155
05:47:22,680 --> 05:47:24,170

but

12156
05:47:24,170 --> 05:47:24,180
but
 

12157
05:47:24,180 --> 05:47:31,910
but
I heard nothing back in my ear monitor

12158
05:47:31,910 --> 05:47:31,920

 

12159
05:47:31,920 --> 05:47:34,070

because we all have ear monitor and we

12160
05:47:34,070 --> 05:47:34,080
because we all have ear monitor and we
 

12161
05:47:34,080 --> 05:47:35,628
because we all have ear monitor and we
could hear

12162
05:47:35,628 --> 05:47:35,638
could hear
 

12163
05:47:35,638 --> 05:47:39,410
could hear
um some comments uh if need be

12164
05:47:39,410 --> 05:47:39,420
um some comments uh if need be
 

12165
05:47:39,420 --> 05:47:45,650
um some comments uh if need be
from behind

12166
05:47:45,650 --> 05:47:45,660

 

12167
05:47:45,660 --> 05:47:50,510

but really that makes it a bit difficult

12168
05:47:50,510 --> 05:47:50,520
but really that makes it a bit difficult
 

12169
05:47:50,520 --> 05:47:52,670
but really that makes it a bit difficult
um

12170
05:47:52,670 --> 05:47:52,680

 

12171
05:47:52,680 --> 05:47:56,150

for this kind of like English streams to

12172
05:47:56,150 --> 05:47:56,160
