Hane, etc. There are some ways to say things like that,

4646
02:07:58,000 --> 02:07:58,010
Hane, etc. There are some ways to say things like that,
 

4647
02:07:58,010 --> 02:08:00,670
Hane, etc. There are some ways to say things like that,
but even if you say you're angry at your seniors, it's

4648
02:08:00,670 --> 02:08:00,680
but even if you say you're angry at your seniors, it's
 

4649
02:08:00,680 --> 02:08:03,750
but even if you say you're angry at your seniors, it's
expensive.Personally, I

4650
02:08:03,750 --> 02:08:03,760

 

4651
02:08:03,760 --> 02:08:08,220

really like it.I

4653
02:08:08,230 --> 02:08:11,870

think it's a place where you can be forgiven for being angry.

4654
02:08:11,870 --> 02:08:11,880
think it's a place where you can be forgiven for being angry.
 

4655

4800
02:11:44,600 --> 02:11:48,280
I've been really busy this week, so the first thing I'm going to say
is the Isogo scene, but I

4801
02:11:48,280 --> 02:11:48,290
is the Isogo scene, but I
 

4802
02:11:48,290 --> 02:11:51,460
is the Isogo scene, but I
think it would be good to use that stream as much as I can,

4806
02:11:52,990 --> 02:11:55,040
so that's
what I did.

4807
02:11:55,040 --> 02:11:55,050
what I did.
 

4808
02:11:55,050 --> 02:11:57,960
what I did.
I'll do my best to stream as much as I can.
