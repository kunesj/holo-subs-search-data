1913
01:25:56,300 --> 01:26:00,950

and I want to check

1914
01:26:00,950 --> 01:26:00,960
and I want to check
 

1915
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:04,430
and I want to check
uh the differences between the the 4090

1916
01:26:04,430 --> 01:26:04,440
uh the differences between the the 4090
 

1917
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:08,930
uh the differences between the the 4090

want to compare that and then compare
 

1921
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:16,010
want to compare that and then compare
means the capability the price is it

1922
01:26:16,010 --> 01:26:16,020
means the capability the price is it
 

1923
01:26:16,020 --> 01:26:18,770
means the capability the price is it
worth it or blah blah blah blah blah

1924

06:02:32,700 --> 06:02:34,190
using a light try and I think I heard
another trident

9554
06:02:34,190 --> 06:02:34,200
another trident
 

9555
06:02:34,200 --> 06:02:37,788

wait so many tried in there

9556
06:02:37,788 --> 06:02:37,798
wait so many tried in there
 

9557
06:02:37,798 --> 06:02:40,128
wait so many tried in there
I think maybe it might maybe it was my

9558

imagination
 

9561
06:02:42,120 --> 06:02:47,410
imagination
so when you try then

9562
06:02:47,410 --> 06:02:47,420

 

9563
06:02:47,420 --> 06:02:51,530

but and they keep on spawning too right
 

9567
06:02:53,458 --> 06:02:55,310
but and they keep on spawning too right
so it's good if I have you you can take

maybe you can put it into inside Phoenix

11734
07:03:35,650 --> 07:03:35,660
maybe you can put it into inside Phoenix
 

11735
07:03:35,660 --> 07:03:39,410
maybe you can put it into inside Phoenix
in this fence

11736
07:03:39,410 --> 07:03:39,420

 

11737
07:03:39,420 --> 07:03:41,868

it's kind of big though

11738
07:03:41,868 --> 07:03:41,878
it's kind of big though
 

11739
07:03:41,878 --> 07:03:45,410
it's kind of big though
yeah

11740
07:03:45,410 --> 07:03:45,420

 

11741
07:03:45,420 --> 07:03:47,930

but how do you transport one can you put

11742
07:03:47,930 --> 07:03:47,940
but how do you transport one can you put

11746
07:03:53,690 --> 07:03:53,700
so maybe I hatch it first here outside
 

11747
07:03:53,700 --> 07:03:57,410
so maybe I hatch it first here outside
and then I take it somewhere with a

11748
07:03:57,410 --> 07:03:57,420
and then I take it somewhere with a
 

11749
07:03:57,420 --> 07:04:00,468
and then I take it somewhere with a
leash when it's hatched but I make a

11750
07:04:00,468 --> 07:04:00,478
leash when it's hatched but I make a
 

11751
07:04:00,478 --> 07:04:04,010
leash when it's hatched but I make a
fence

11752
07:04:04,010 --> 07:04:04,020

 

11753
07:04:04,020 --> 07:04:05,810

yes yes

11754
07:04:05,810 --> 07:04:05,820
yes yes
 

11755
07:04:05,820 --> 07:04:08,868
yes yes
can it go over

11756
07:04:08,868 --> 07:04:08,878
can it go over
 

11757
07:04:08,878 --> 07:04:10,968
can it go over
double blocks probably not just one

11758
07:04:10,968 --> 07:04:10,978
double blocks probably not just one
 

11759
07:04:10,978 --> 07:04:16,010
double blocks probably not just one
blocks maybe like like this

11760
07:04:16,010 --> 07:04:16,020

 

11761
07:04:16,020 --> 07:04:18,770

I wonder because the camel camels can go

11762
07:04:18,770 --> 07:04:18,780

11763
07:04:18,780 --> 07:04:21,288
I wonder because the camel camels can go
up two blocks and even over fences and

11764
07:04:21,288 --> 07:04:21,298
up two blocks and even over fences and
 

11765
