together after two hours then I can't do
it either

446
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:12,240

 

447
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,710

I mean you can eat on it but

450
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:19,860
I mean you can eat on it but
 

451
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:28,490
I mean you can eat on it but
it's it's kind of shaky

452
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:28,500

 

453
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,110

454
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:30,120
okay
 

455
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,950
okay
I'm gonna play this game or what

456
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:33,960

 

457
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:40,150

um

458
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:40,160

 

459
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,490

the wobble is a feature I feel like the

460
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:43,500
the wobble is a feature I feel like the
 

461
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,789
the wobble is a feature I feel like the
table is gaslighting me to things the

462
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:46,799
table is gaslighting me to things the
 

463
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,150
table is gaslighting me to things the
same thing

464
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:49,160
same thing
 

465
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,590
same thing
you know we just couldn't get it right

466
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:51,600
you know we just couldn't get it right
 

467
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,650
you know we just couldn't get it right
so at some point I was like maybe tables

468
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:54,660
so at some point I was like maybe tables
 

469
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:59,750
so at some point I was like maybe tables
are supposed to wobble

470
00:17:59,750 --> 00:17:59,760

 

471
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,470

maybe that's normal

472
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:03,480

 

473
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:10,850

hmm

474
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:10,860

 

475
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,789

I mean I can't eat on it so

476
00:18:13,789 --> 00:18:13,799
I mean I can't eat on it so
 

477
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:20,210
I mean I can't eat on it so
in in theory it's functional

478
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:20,220

 

479
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,029

not uneven
 

483
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,830
not uneven
it's a weird system where maybe I'll

484
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:27,840
it's a weird system where maybe I'll
 

485
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,750
it's a weird system where maybe I'll
maybe I'll paint it for you guys at some

486
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:29,760
maybe I'll paint it for you guys at some
 

487
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,070
maybe I'll paint it for you guys at some
point

488
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:31,080
point
 

489
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,650

have a sausage it was also filled with

4026
01:51:07,669 --> 01:51:07,679
have a sausage it was also filled with
 

4027
01:51:07,679 --> 01:51:11,229
have a sausage it was also filled with

and that one uh
 

4033
01:51:17,159 --> 01:51:19,550
and that one uh
I think

4034
01:51:19,550 --> 01:51:19,560
I think
 

4035
01:51:19,560 --> 01:51:21,890
I think
it had like a tiny sausage at the very

4036
01:51:21,890 --> 01:51:21,900
it had like a tiny sausage at the very
 

4037
01:51:21,900 --> 01:51:24,350
it had like a tiny sausage at the very
bottom also maybe I'm not sure anymore

4038
01:51:24,350 --> 01:51:24,360
bottom also maybe I'm not sure anymore
 

4039
01:51:24,360 --> 01:51:26,270
bottom also maybe I'm not sure anymore
but then she tells me to finish the

4040
01:51:26,270 --> 01:51:26,280
but then she tells me to finish the
 

4041
01:51:26,280 --> 01:51:28,129
but then she tells me to finish the
first one because there might be a tiny

4042
01:51:28,129 --> 01:51:28,139
first one because there might be a tiny
 

4043
01:51:28,139 --> 01:51:29,570
first one because there might be a tiny
tiny tiny baby sausage at the very

4044
01:51:29,570 --> 01:51:29,580
tiny tiny baby sausage at the very
 

4045
01:51:29,580 --> 01:51:31,790
tiny tiny baby sausage at the very
bottom so I'm like okay I guess because

4046
01:51:31,790 --> 01:51:31,800
bottom so I'm like okay I guess because
 

4047
01:51:31,800 --> 01:51:36,410
bottom so I'm like okay I guess because
I still I really want that sausage now

01:53:25,860 --> 01:53:31,189

surprise path

4120
01:53:31,189 --> 01:53:31,199

 

4121
01:53:31,199 --> 01:53:33,709

4125
01:53:35,699 --> 01:53:40,910
pretty cold
I like it it's so original

4126
01:53:40,910 --> 01:53:40,920

 

4127
01:53:40,920 --> 01:53:46,089

I feel like very original this place

4128
01:53:46,089 --> 01:53:46,099

 

4129
01:53:46,099 --> 01:53:48,649

hey uh too late did I just kill him with

4130
01:53:48,649 --> 01:53:48,659
hey uh too late did I just kill him with
 

4131
01:53:48,659 --> 01:53:52,070

two hits incredible
 

4133
01:53:52,080 --> 01:53:56,270
two hits incredible
so at this point it was like

4134
01:53:56,270 --> 01:53:56,280

 

4135
01:53:56,280 --> 01:53:59,750

05:00:04,200 --> 05:00:08,448
my best to eat it I put in some cheese
too and an egg a raw egg that kind of

10018
05:00:08,448 --> 05:00:08,458
too and an egg a raw egg that kind of
 

10019
05:00:08,458 --> 05:00:10,610
too and an egg a raw egg that kind of
with the hot water it turned into a

10020
05:00:10,610 --> 05:00:10,620
with the hot water it turned into a
 

10021
05:00:10,620 --> 05:00:15,650
with the hot water it turned into a
fried egg boiled boiled fried egg

10022
05:00:15,650 --> 05:00:15,660
fried egg boiled boiled fried egg
 

10023
05:00:15,660 --> 05:00:18,530
fried egg boiled boiled fried egg
oh

10024
05:00:18,530 --> 05:00:18,540

 

10025
05:00:18,540 --> 05:00:20,570

and we used those machines like outside

10026
05:00:20,570 --> 05:00:20,580
and we used those machines like outside
 

10027
05:00:20,580 --> 05:00:23,030
and we used those machines like outside
of the convenience store I think I guess

10028
05:00:23,030 --> 05:00:23,040
of the convenience store I think I guess
 

10029
05:00:23,040 --> 05:00:24,830
of the convenience store I think I guess
they don't have that at every

10030
05:00:24,830 --> 05:00:24,840
they don't have that at every
 

10031
05:00:24,840 --> 05:00:26,628
they don't have that at every
convenience store in Korea but they have

10032
05:00:26,628 --> 05:00:26,638
convenience store in Korea but they have
 

10033
05:00:26,638 --> 05:00:28,730
convenience store in Korea but they have
it by the by the river

10034
05:00:28,730 --> 05:00:28,740
it by the by the river
 

10035
05:00:28,740 --> 05:00:31,850
it by the by the river
so in this case they had these machines

10036
05:00:31,850 --> 05:00:31,860
so in this case they had these machines
 

10037
05:00:31,860 --> 05:00:35,690
so in this case they had these machines
out there when you cook the ramen

10038
05:00:35,690 --> 05:00:35,700
out there when you cook the ramen
 

10039
05:00:35,700 --> 05:00:42,830
out there when you cook the ramen
can I speak by or do I have to fight you

10040
05:00:42,830 --> 05:00:42,840

 

10041
05:00:42,840 --> 05:00:45,830

I'm gonna try to sneak

10042
05:00:45,830 --> 05:00:45,840
I'm gonna try to sneak
 

10043
05:00:45,840 --> 05:00:47,628
I'm gonna try to sneak
so I was like let me almost show me how

10044
05:00:47,628 --> 05:00:47,638
so I was like let me almost show me how
 

10045
05:00:47,638 --> 05:00:49,970
so I was like let me almost show me how
to do it but turns out

10046
05:00:49,970 --> 05:00:49,980
to do it but turns out
 

10047
05:00:49,980 --> 05:00:52,190
to do it but turns out
I think it was her first time doing it I

10048
05:00:52,190 --> 05:00:52,200
I think it was her first time doing it I
 

10049
05:00:52,200 --> 05:00:53,628
I think it was her first time doing it I
think she said even first time or second

10050
05:00:53,628 --> 05:00:53,638
think she said even first time or second
 

10051
05:00:53,638 --> 05:00:56,570
think she said even first time or second
time almost probably the first time

10052
05:00:56,570 --> 05:00:56,580
time almost probably the first time
 

10053
05:00:56,580 --> 05:00:59,270
time almost probably the first time
um so she wasn't quite sure about how to

10054
05:00:59,270 --> 05:00:59,280
um so she wasn't quite sure about how to
 

10055
05:00:59,280 --> 05:01:02,330
um so she wasn't quite sure about how to
use it herself either but I was watching

10056
05:01:02,330 --> 05:01:02,340
use it herself either but I was watching
 

10057
05:01:02,340 --> 05:01:04,310
use it herself either but I was watching
her figuring it out and then I did my

10058
05:01:04,310 --> 05:01:04,320
her figuring it out and then I did my
 

10059
05:01:04,320 --> 05:01:05,448
her figuring it out and then I did my
own

10060
05:01:05,448 --> 05:01:05,458
own
 

10061
05:01:05,458 --> 05:01:07,730
own
and then we sat down and then I used

10062
05:01:07,730 --> 05:01:07,740
and then we sat down and then I used
 

10063
05:01:07,740 --> 05:01:10,670
and then we sat down and then I used
this trick that Nabi mama told me about

10064
05:01:10,670 --> 05:01:10,680
this trick that Nabi mama told me about
 

10065
