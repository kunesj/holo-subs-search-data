though.  When I looked at these curtains, I

197
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:15,600
though.  When I looked at these curtains, I
 

198
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,890

person at the store told me that it
 

204
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,550
person at the store told me that it
was designed for a children's room,

205
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:25,560
was designed for a children's room,
 

206
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,710
was designed for a children's room,
but Maria hasn't seen it yet.  I'm

okay, but I

228
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,350

At the convenience store.

2184
01:02:31,490 --> 01:02:31,500
At the convenience store.
 

2185
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:33,770
At the convenience store.
At convenience stores and other places, there are

2186
01:02:33,770 --> 01:02:33,780
At convenience stores and other places, there are
 

2187
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:36,890
At convenience stores and other places, there are
more cash registers where you pay by yourself.You

2188
01:02:36,890 --> 01:02:36,900
more cash registers where you pay by yourself.You
 

2189
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:42,349
more cash registers where you pay by yourself.You
put your money in there, and there are already plastic bags.It's

2190
01:02:42,349 --> 01:02:42,359
put your money in there, and there are already plastic bags.It's
 

2191
01:02:42,359 --> 01:02:43,089
put your money in there, and there are already plastic bags.It's

2192

2193
01:02:43,099 --> 01:02:46,010

that color now, but overseas it's always been

2194
01:02:46,010 --> 01:02:46,020
that color now, but overseas it's always been
 

2195
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:48,230
that color now, but overseas it's always been
that way, so I

2196
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:48,240
that way, so I
 

2197
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:51,170
that way, so I
don't really care about those plastic bags.

2198
01:02:51,170 --> 01:02:52,789
don't really care about those plastic bags.

2200
01:02:52,799 --> 01:02:56,630

Now that you have to pay for things, you've had to put them in plastic bags yourself in

2201
01:02:56,630 --> 01:02:56,640
Now that you have to pay for things, you've had to put them in plastic bags yourself in
 

2202
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,370
Now that you have to pay for things, you've had to put them in plastic bags yourself in
many places.Even

2203
01:02:58,370 --> 01:02:59,990
many places.Even
 

2204

2205
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,690

though they don't often put things in your shopping bags, it's not the only thing

2206
01:03:02,690 --> 01:03:02,700
though they don't often put things in your shopping bags, it's not the only thing
 

2207

I've ever experienced on this
trip.  What I have experienced in  They

2211
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:10,490

wouldn't let me in for quite a while, but I'm

2212
01:03:10,490 --> 01:03:11,990
wouldn't let me in for quite a while, but I'm
 

2213

2214
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,450

fine with paying for it myself, but I'm not good at buying it myself,

2215
01:03:14,450 --> 01:03:14,460
fine with paying for it myself, but I'm not good at buying it myself,
 

2216
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:16,490
fine with paying for it myself, but I'm not good at buying it myself,
so I get a little nervous.Well, it's

01:03:16,490 --> 01:03:16,500
so I get a little nervous.Well, it's
 

2218
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:18,289
so I get a little nervous.Well, it's
not a supermarket, it's a convenience store.They let me

in.A convenience store
is a convenience store.  That's right, but

2223
01:03:22,609 --> 01:03:22,619
is a convenience store.  That's right, but
 

2224
01:03:22,619 --> 01:03:24,829
is a convenience store.  That's right, but
other places won't let you in anymore. When it comes to

2225
01:03:24,829 --> 01:03:24,839
other places won't let you in anymore. When it comes to
 

2226
01:03:24,839 --> 01:03:27,109
other places won't let you in anymore. When it comes to
supermarkets, etc., you have to

2227
01:03:27,109 --> 01:03:27,119
supermarkets, etc., you have to
 

2228
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:31,069
supermarkets, etc., you have to
put them away by yourself. It

2229
01:03:31,069 --> 01:03:31,079
put them away by yourself. It
 

2230
01:03:31,079 --> 01:03:34,569
put them away by yourself. It
was just a store where you could go for drinks or something.

2231
01:03:34,569 --> 01:03:34,579
was just a store where you could go for drinks or something.
 

2232
01:03:34,579 --> 01:03:37,849
was just a store where you could go for drinks or something.
But things like that have increased, things have changed, and I

01:03:37,849 --> 01:03:37,859
But things like that have increased, things have changed, and I
 

2234
01:03:37,859 --> 01:03:42,049
But things like that have increased, things have changed, and I
thought, ``Japan has changed so much in two years.'' I do

2235
01:03:42,049 --> 01:03:42,059
thought, ``Japan has changed so much in two years.'' I do
 

2236

2239
01:03:46,859 --> 01:03:48,710

n't think it's changed that much in a year and a half, but has it changed that much?

2242
01:03:49,619 --> 01:03:52,250

Marin also changed when I met her for the first time in a year and a half.  Well,

01:03:56,339 --> 01:03:57,890
I
guess I should say I

2254
01:04:04,619 --> 01:04:07,190

too long since I've canceled it.It's because I

2255
01:04:07,190 --> 01:04:07,200
too long since I've canceled it.It's because I
 

2256
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:08,990
too long since I've canceled it.It's because I
met my paralyzed senior.  About

came back to me. I
 

2291
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:58,370
came back to me. I
went back to the entrance and I was there.  I was looking at her face,

She said something to me because she did something for me, right? I guess she said, 'I can't do that.' To be
honest, I'm a little confused.

2304
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:25,260

 

2305
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:28,069

poop, I
started to see how cute it was, and it was

01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,430
started to see how cute it was, and it was
completely different, as expected, but the

01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:35,930
completely different, as expected, but the

looked like slimes,

2321
01:05:42,289 --> 01:05:42,299
looked like slimes,
 

2322
01:05:42,299 --> 01:05:44,930
looked like slimes,
even though they were wearing masks.

2323

look in front of me. She
 

2330
01:05:50,819 --> 01:05:53,690
look in front of me. She
was cute before, but I feel like she's cuter this time. Maybe

2331
01:05:53,690 --> 01:05:56,990
was cute before, but I feel like she's cuter this time. Maybe

2423
01:08:33,319 --> 01:08:37,490

Yes, it was okay. I guess I

2424
01:08:37,490 --> 01:08:38,930
Yes, it was okay. I guess I
 

2425
01:08:38,930 --> 01:08:38,940

 

2426
01:08:38,940 --> 01:08:40,490

drinks. I was already full.
 

2430
01:08:44,759 --> 01:08:49,309

2432
01:08:49,319 --> 01:08:51,769

didn't break it, but it

2433
01:08:51,769 --> 01:08:51,779
didn't break it, but it
 

2434
01:08:51,779 --> 01:08:55,090
didn't break it, but it
was like someone bumped into me and said something like that.

2435
01:08:55,090 --> 01:08:55,100
was like someone bumped into me and said something like that.
 

2436

Something like that happened to me. That thing behind the

all sorts of stylish, and I thought it looked like Japan. I

01:09:13,309 --> 01:09:13,319
all sorts of stylish, and I thought it looked like Japan. I
 

2443
01:09:13,319 --> 01:09:15,169
all sorts of stylish, and I thought it looked like Japan. I
