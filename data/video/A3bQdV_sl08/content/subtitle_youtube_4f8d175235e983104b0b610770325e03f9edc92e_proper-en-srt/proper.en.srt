00:00:00,918 --> 00:00:03,821
​​<i>​ ​A phoenix has countless lives.​ ​</i>​

2
00:00:04,989 --> 00:00:05,089
​​<i>​ ​​​ ​</i>​

3
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:07,992
​​<i>​ ​Sometimes, a symbol of hope.​ ​</i>​

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,629
​​<i>​ ​Sometimes, a portent of prosperity.​ ​</i>​

5
00:00:14,064 --> 00:00:17,468
​​<i>​ ​Sometimes, an avatar of rebirth.​ ​</i>​

6
00:00:19,036 --> 00:00:22,706
​​<i>​ ​For eons, I've used​ ​</i>​
​<i>​ ​my power to help people.​ ​</i>​

7
00:00:22,706 --> 00:00:24,908
​​<i>​ ​There's not a problem I can't solve!​ ​</i>​

8
00:00:24,908 --> 00:00:26,377
​​<i>​ ​Or so I thought...​ ​</i>​

9
00:00:26,377 --> 00:00:27,444
​​<i>​ ​It all started one day,​ ​</i>​

10
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:30,347
​​<i>​ ​when I decided to drop by​ ​</i>​
​<i>​ ​my favorite fast food place​ ​</i>​

11
00:00:30,347 --> 00:00:32,516
​​<i>​ ​for one of their delicious burgers.​ ​</i>​

12
00:00:32,516 --> 00:00:34,418
​​<i>​ ​I found out that​ ​</i>​
​<i>​ ​they were almost broke,​ ​</i>​

13
00:00:34,418 --> 00:00:37,321
​​<i>​ ​and would have to close​ ​</i>​
​<i>​ ​if they couldn't pay back their debts.​ ​</i>​

14
00:00:38,055 --> 00:00:40,524
​​<i>​ ​Pfft, with my powers? No problem!​ ​</i>​

15
00:00:40,524 --> 00:00:43,093
​​<i>​ ​We just gotta make​ ​</i>​
​<i>​ ​this thing called... "profit," right?​ ​</i>​

16
00:00:43,093 --> 00:00:44,428
​​<i>​ ​Should be a piece of cake...​ ​</i>​

17
00:00:44,428 --> 00:00:45,329
​​<i>​ ​But it wasn't!​ ​</i>​

18
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:47,865
​​<i>​ ​Once I became a "part-timer,"​ ​</i>​
​<i>​ ​my fate was sealed!​ ​</i>​

19
00:00:47,865 --> 00:00:50,067
​​<i>​ ​It was work, work, and more work!​ ​</i>​

20
00:00:50,067 --> 00:00:53,404
​​<i>​ ​I used to lead armies!​ ​</i>​
​<i>​ ​Now I'm working for minimum wage?!​ ​</i>​

21
00:00:53,404 --> 00:00:55,139
​​<i>​ ​Making money is hard...​ ​</i>​

22
00:00:55,139 --> 00:00:56,840
​​<i>​ ​I can't just beat up bad guys.​ ​</i>​

23
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,842
​​<i>​ ​Instead, I gotta​ ​</i>​
​<i>​ ​keep the restaurant clean,​ ​</i>​

24
00:00:58,842 --> 00:01:01,912
​​<i>​ ​serve good food, and make​ ​</i>​
​<i>​ ​customers want to come again.​ ​</i>​

25
00:01:02,346 --> 00:01:05,516
​​<i>​ ​And keep doing it,​ ​</i>​
​<i>​ ​day after day after day...​ ​</i>​

26
00:01:05,516 --> 00:01:09,820
​​​ ​*pant* *pant* I'm gonna die!​ ​​
​​ ​And I'm supposed to be immortal!​ ​​

27
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,321
​​<i>​ ​At the same time...​ ​</i>​

28
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:12,923
​​<i>​ ​it was also a lot of fun.​ ​</i>​

29
00:01:13,724 --> 00:01:15,626
​​<i>​ ​I learned to do so many new things.​ ​</i>​

30
00:01:15,626 --> 00:01:18,529
​​<i>​ ​I'm happy,​ ​</i>​
​<i>​ ​and everyone else is happy, too.​ ​</i>​

31
00:01:18,529 --> 00:01:20,330
​​<i>​ ​They all tell me how good the food is.​ ​</i>​

32
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,365
​​<i>​ ​Business is booming,​ ​</i>​

33
00:01:21,365 --> 00:01:22,766
​​<i>​ ​and the debt's all repaid.​ ​</i>​

34
00:01:22,766 --> 00:01:27,037
​​<i>​ ​In fact, even the debt collectors​ ​</i>​
​<i>​ ​are now regular customers.​ ​</i>​

35
00:01:27,037 --> 00:01:29,306
​​<i>​ ​The owner was overjoyed.​ ​</i>​

36
00:01:29,306 --> 00:01:31,375
​​<i>​ ​I'd call that a happy ending.​ ​</i>​
