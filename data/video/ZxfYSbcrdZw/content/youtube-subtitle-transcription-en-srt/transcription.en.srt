right before my showcase but then she

412
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:57,240
right before my showcase but then she
 

413
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,450
right before my showcase but then she
says that because she's nervous when it

414
00:21:59,450 --> 00:21:59,460
says that because she's nervous when it
 

415
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,470
says that because she's nervous when it
happened before that she couldn't sleep

but I said that's probably not the only
 

419
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,430
but I said that's probably not the only
reason it's probably because you stream

420
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:04,440
reason it's probably because you stream
 

421
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,750
reason it's probably because you stream
all night and then you're used to

422
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:05,760
all night and then you're used to
 

423
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,490
all night and then you're used to
sleeping like early in the morning and

424
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:07,500
sleeping like early in the morning and
 

425
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,470
sleeping like early in the morning and
so that's why you can't get up and she

426
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:09,480
so that's why you can't get up and she
 

427
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,220
