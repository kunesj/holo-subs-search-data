see.So, for example, red  The team is a mess

1052
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:53,510

1054
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,270

If I kill them and get 10 points for the 1st place red team, but if I kill Iris once, I get

1055
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:57,280
If I kill them and get 10 points for the 1st place red team, but if I kill Iris once, I get

2 points and get 12 points.That's
crazy, so I wonder if Iris will

That's right, because you have 3 hearts, if you're on the brink of death, it's more advantageous to go and kill the person with 1 heart.Yes, that's

think I have a pretty good idea of ​​how to do it.I just
have one question.What do you think?How many times did

1384
00:48:20,549 --> 00:48:20,559
have one question.What do you think?How many times did

have one question.What do you think?How many times did
that general kill something?  I

that general kill something?  I
 

1387

but if the general was defeated that one time, you'd

1390
00:48:31,069 --> 00:48:31,079
but if the general was defeated that one time, you'd
 

1391
00:48:31,079 --> 00:48:35,190
but if the general was defeated that one time, you'd
get 1 point, right?But it

00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:38,430
get 1 point, right?But it
 

1393

00:50:58,750 --> 00:50:58,760
splitting up into teams. I
 

1463
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:03,549
splitting up into teams. I
still have the equipment for the bar line, but it's

1464
00:51:03,549 --> 00:51:03,559
still have the equipment for the bar line, but it's
 

1465

better to have the equipment for the wood line.  I wonder

1466
00:51:07,870 --> 00:51:07,880
better to have the equipment for the wood line.  I wonder
 

1467
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:11,430
better to have the equipment for the wood line.  I wonder
if I'm in the middle of the game, but I

1468
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:11,440
if I'm in the middle of the game, but I
 

1469
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:16,069
if I'm in the middle of the game, but I
think there's just a lot of people left, so

1470
00:51:16,069 --> 00:51:16,079
think there's just a lot of people left, so
 

1471
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:19,990
think there's just a lot of people left, so
I entered an entry where we were really fighting each other. It's

1472
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:20,870

2001
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:25,030


2002
01:10:25,030 --> 01:10:25,040

2008
01:10:39,070 --> 01:10:39,080
Wait, I came to the bar. Let's go and
 

2009
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:42,990
Wait, I came to the bar. Let's go and
get the baubba. It's amazing.

2010
01:10:42,990 --> 01:10:43,000

Even with this, you can't eat UB, you can't eat it,

Even with this, you can't eat UB, you can't eat it,
 

2013
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:50,830
Even with this, you can't eat UB, you can't eat it,
you're under pressure. I think it's a lot of pressure for

you're under pressure. I think it's a lot of pressure for
 

2015
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:54,390
you're under pressure. I think it's a lot of pressure for
the two of us to reach the goal. Un-chan was

2016
01:10:54,390 --> 01:10:54,400
the two of us to reach the goal. Un-chan was
 

2017
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,870
the two of us to reach the goal. Un-chan was
doing a lot of work, but it's dangerous for him to reach the goal.

2018
01:10:56,870 --> 01:10:56,880
doing a lot of work, but it's dangerous for him to reach the goal.
 

2019
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:02,550
doing a lot of work, but it's dangerous for him to reach the goal.
Normally, it's a little bit of a little bit, and this

Amiko-senpai, this is so messed up yesterday.

2387

Amiko-senpai, this is so messed up yesterday.
 

2388
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:35,750
Amiko-senpai, this is so messed up yesterday.
The layout is completely different. This is just my feeling. I'm

2389
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:35,760
The layout is completely different. This is just my feeling. I'm
 

2390
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:38,870
The layout is completely different. This is just my feeling. I'm
making some adjustments to it, actually.  I'm

2391
01:22:38,870 --> 01:22:41,510
making some adjustments to it, actually.  I'm
 

2392
01:22:41,510 --> 01:22:41,520

 

2393
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:45,110

surprised that this has changed so much. Even if you're a, you

2394
01:22:45,110 --> 01:22:45,120
surprised that this has changed so much. Even if you're a, you
 

2395
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:48,350
surprised that this has changed so much. Even if you're a, you
can do it. Thank you very much. It's already been a long time

2396
01:22:48,350 --> 01:22:48,360
can do it. Thank you very much. It's already been a long time
 

2397
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:51,550
can do it. Thank you very much. It's already been a long time
since you won. By the way,

2398
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:51,560
since you won. By the way,
 

2399
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:53,430
since you won. By the way,

2400
01:22:53,430 --> 01:22:53,440

 

2401
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:57,550

Miko, I think it's okay to throw to the top.  There are a

2402
01:22:57,550 --> 01:22:57,560
Miko, I think it's okay to throw to the top.  There are a
 

2403
01:22:57,560 --> 01:23:01,750
Miko, I think it's okay to throw to the top.  There are a
lot of options around here,

2404
01:23:01,750 --> 01:23:01,760
lot of options around here,
 

2405
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:05,470
lot of options around here,
right? When you fall, it's like adjusting a little bit.

2406
01:23:05,470 --> 01:23:05,480
right? When you fall, it's like adjusting a little bit.
 

2407
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:10,149
right? When you fall, it's like adjusting a little bit.
The goal is about 20 seconds,

2408
01:23:10,149 --> 01:23:10,159
The goal is about 20 seconds,
 

2409
01:23:10,159 --> 01:23:13,669
The goal is about 20 seconds,
so it's probably better to stay at the highest point.

2410
01:23:13,669 --> 01:23:13,679
so it's probably better to stay at the highest point.
 

2411
01:23:13,679 --> 01:23:17,350
so it's probably better to stay at the highest point.
Well, the course will be different tomorrow too.  I'm going to

2412
01:23:17,350 --> 01:23:17,360
Well, the course will be different tomorrow too.  I'm going to
 

2413
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:19,870
Well, the course will be different tomorrow too.  I'm going to
make some adjustments. This

2414
01:23:19,870 --> 01:23:19,880
make some adjustments. This
 

2415
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:23,189
make some adjustments. This
is the final one, so if you can make this as much as possible, it'll be

2416
01:23:23,189 --> 01:23:23,199
is the final one, so if you can make this as much as possible, it'll be
 

2417
01:23:23,199 --> 01:23:25,390
is the final one, so if you can make this as much as possible, it'll be
as normal as it should be.

2418
01:23:25,390 --> 01:23:25,400
as normal as it should be.
 

2419
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:31,030
as normal as it should be.
321 So I

2420
01:23:31,030 --> 01:23:31,040

 

2421
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:38,310


2422
01:23:38,310 --> 01:23:38,320

 

2423
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:42,990

was in the middle of falling down.

2424
01:23:42,990 --> 01:23:43,000
was in the middle of falling down.
 

2425
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,149
was in the middle of falling down.
Yesterday was easier than yesterday.  I feel like it's

2426
01:23:45,149 --> 01:23:49,270
Yesterday was easier than yesterday.  I feel like it's
 

2427
01:23:49,270 --> 01:23:49,280

 

2428
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:51,229

a bit of a challenge, but if you don't mind, let's practice together after this.

2429
01:23:51,229 --> 01:23:51,239
a bit of a challenge, but if you don't mind, let's practice together after this.
 

2430
01:23:51,239 --> 01:23:54,070
a bit of a challenge, but if you don't mind, let's practice together after this.
Let's practice. Let's

2431
01:23:54,070 --> 01:23:54,080
Let's practice. Let's
 

2432
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:56,910
Let's practice. Let's
all get together once and do the next relay.

2433
01:23:56,910 --> 01:23:56,920
all get together once and do the next relay.
 

2434
01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:59,870
all get together once and do the next relay.
Once I've done that, I think I'll be able to do it pretty freely.Okay,

2435
01:23:59,870 --> 01:24:04,030
Once I've done that, I think I'll be able to do it pretty freely.Okay,
 

2436
01:24:04,030 --> 01:24:04,040

 

2437
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:07,750

then I'll just use the Boyz server for

2438
01:24:07,750 --> 01:24:07,760
then I'll just use the Boyz server for
 

2439
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:10,149
then I'll just use the Boyz server for
once.I'll leave it as it is.Either way, I'll go to the relay.I'm going to

2440
01:24:10,149 --> 01:24:10,159
once.I'll leave it as it is.Either way, I'll go to the relay.I'm going to
 

2441
01:24:10,159 --> 01:24:13,950
once.I'll leave it as it is.Either way, I'll go to the relay.I'm going to
go to Ore's Go Let's Go

2442
01:24:13,950 --> 01:24:13,960
go to Ore's Go Let's Go
 

2443
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:16,830
go to Ore's Go Let's Go
Go Relay.This year's system is

2444
01:24:16,830 --> 01:24:16,840
Go Relay.This year's system is
 

2445
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:22,990
Go Relay.This year's system is
amazing.  The system is so big that it

2446
01:24:22,990 --> 01:24:23,000
amazing.  The system is so big that it
 

2447
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,910
amazing.  The system is so big that it
automatically warps when it's that person's turn,

2448
01:24:25,910 --> 01:24:25,920
automatically warps when it's that person's turn,
 

2449
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:30,070
automatically warps when it's that person's turn,
so you

2450
01:24:30,070 --> 01:24:30,080
so you
 

2451
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,990
so you
have to register, which is a bit

2452
01:24:31,990 --> 01:24:32,000
have to register, which is a bit
 

2453
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,629
have to register, which is a bit
complicated, so let's do it together now.

2454
01:24:33,629 --> 01:24:37,149
complicated, so let's do it together now.
 

2455
01:24:37,149 --> 01:24:40,550

 

2456
01:24:40,550 --> 01:24:44,390

 

2457
01:24:44,390 --> 01:24:44,400

 

2458
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:47,270

Well, let's do it. It's the other side. It's the turn of the relay today. There are all the people who will be participating in the relay today. It's not everyone. Well, wait a little. I

2459
01:24:47,270 --> 01:24:47,280
Well, let's do it. It's the other side. It's the turn of the relay today. There are all the people who will be participating in the relay today. It's not everyone. Well, wait a little. I
 

2460

practicing without starting.Oh
yeah, but

2924
01:40:19,270 --> 01:40:19,280
yeah, but
 

2925
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:24,070
yeah, but
if I have one more time, I'll do it at all, but I guess it's okay.So,

2926
01:40:24,070 --> 01:40:24,080
if I have one more time, I'll do it at all, but I guess it's okay.So,
 

2927
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:27,589
if I have one more time, I'll do it at all, but I guess it's okay.So,
with Ride,

2928
01:40:27,589 --> 01:40:27,599
with Ride,
 

2929
01:40:27,599 --> 01:40:31,470
with Ride,
is it okay to practice without using that system?  Oh oh

2930
01:40:31,470 --> 01:40:31,480
is it okay to practice without using that system?  Oh oh
 

2931
01:40:31,480 --> 01:40:33,390
is it okay to practice without using that system?  Oh oh
oh

2932
01:40:33,390 --> 01:40:33,400
oh
 

2933
01:40:33,400 --> 01:40:37,430
oh
I didn't eat bread just now, but

2934
01:40:37,430 --> 01:40:37,440
I didn't eat bread just now, but
 

2935
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:40,470
I didn't eat bread just now, but
Lua says I have to eat bread.

2936
01:40:40,470 --> 01:40:40,480
Lua says I have to eat bread.
 

2937
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:42,629
Lua says I have to eat bread.
I didn't eat it either. I don't have to eat either. But if I don't

2938
01:40:42,629 --> 01:40:42,639
I didn't eat it either. I don't have to eat either. But if I don't
 

2939
01:40:42,639 --> 01:40:46,030
I didn't eat it either. I don't have to eat either. But if I don't
eat, I won't recover my strength,

2940
01:40:46,030 --> 01:40:46,040
eat, I won't recover my strength,
 

2941
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:47,950
eat, I won't recover my strength,
so I'll be late.  It's

2942
01:40:47,950 --> 01:40:52,070
so I'll be late.  It's
 

2943
01:40:52,070 --> 01:40:53,990

 

2944
01:40:53,990 --> 01:40:57,629

 

2945
01:40:57,629 --> 01:40:57,639

 

2946
01:40:57,639 --> 01:41:01,390

fine, but if you're full, I want you to take the bread that you couldn't eat.

2947
01:41:01,390 --> 01:41:04,390
fine, but if you're full, I want you to take the bread that you couldn't eat.
 

2948
01:41:04,390 --> 01:41:04,400

 

2949
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:06,709

Well, you can reach the goal even if you don't take it.

2950
01:41:06,709 --> 01:41:06,719
Well, you can reach the goal even if you don't take it.
 

2951
01:41:06,719 --> 01:41:09,589
Well, you can reach the goal even if you don't take it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I want that.

2952
01:41:09,589 --> 01:41:13,709
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I want that.
 

2953
01:41:13,709 --> 01:41:16,390

 

2954
01:41:16,390 --> 01:41:16,400

 

2955
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:20,149

Okay, it's pretty difficult, so make sure to take it. You don't have to eat it. You don't have to eat it. But if it's okay if it's late, then feel

2956
01:41:20,149 --> 01:41:20,159
Okay, it's pretty difficult, so make sure to take it. You don't have to eat it. You don't have to eat it. But if it's okay if it's late, then feel
 

2957
01:41:20,159 --> 01:41:21,950
Okay, it's pretty difficult, so make sure to take it. You don't have to eat it. You don't have to eat it. But if it's okay if it's late, then feel
it.  I guess it's not like

2958
01:41:21,950 --> 01:41:21,960
it.  I guess it's not like
 

2959
01:41:21,960 --> 01:41:23,709
it.  I guess it's not like
if you don't eat it, it's a violation of the rules.

2960
01:41:23,709 --> 01:41:23,719
if you don't eat it, it's a violation of the rules.
 

2961
01:41:23,719 --> 01:41:27,350
if you don't eat it, it's a violation of the rules.
Yeah, you have to take Japan.

2962
01:41:27,350 --> 01:41:27,360
Yeah, you have to take Japan.
 

2963
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:32,070
Yeah, you have to take Japan.
That's a rule. Well, since I'm here, I

2964
01:41:32,070 --> 01:41:32,080
That's a rule. Well, since I'm here, I
 

2965
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:35,350
That's a rule. Well, since I'm here, I
want to make it feel like each team is together,

2966
01:41:35,350 --> 01:41:35,360
want to make it feel like each team is together,
 

2967
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:40,910
want to make it feel like each team is together,
but I guess it's fine for competitions that use the system.

2968
01:41:40,910 --> 01:41:40,920
but I guess it's fine for competitions that use the system.
 

2969
01:41:40,920 --> 01:41:44,390
but I guess it's fine for competitions that use the system.
That's the only way I can move, so yeah, yeah,

2970
01:41:44,390 --> 01:41:44,400
That's the only way I can move, so yeah, yeah,
 

2971
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:47,550
That's the only way I can move, so yeah, yeah,
let's gather all the people who want to do it. Hey,

2972
01:41:47,550 --> 01:41:47,560
let's gather all the people who want to do it. Hey,
 

2973
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:49,589
let's gather all the people who want to do it. Hey,
oh,

2974
01:41:49,589 --> 01:41:49,599
oh,
 

2975
01:41:49,599 --> 01:41:52,669
oh,
then when I go out and do some kind of competition, I'll have a chat with you and

2976
01:41:52,669 --> 01:41:52,679
then when I go out and do some kind of competition, I'll have a chat with you and
 

2977
01:41:52,679 --> 01:41:55,070
then when I go out and do some kind of competition, I'll have a chat with you and
then I'll go over there. Oh,

2978
01:41:55,070 --> 01:41:55,080
then I'll go over there. Oh,
 

2979
01:41:55,080 --> 01:41:58,189
then I'll go over there. Oh,
oh, I'm sorry, please.

2980
01:41:58,189 --> 01:41:58,199
oh, I'm sorry, please.
 

2981
01:41:58,199 --> 01:42:01,310
oh, I'm sorry, please.
Please, please.  I'll pass it on to you, Relay. I'll

2982
01:42:01,310 --> 01:42:01,320
Please, please.  I'll pass it on to you, Relay. I'll
 

2983
01:42:01,320 --> 01:42:04,350
Please, please.  I'll pass it on to you, Relay. I'll
do it again. Are you feeling like you're doing it? Relay.

2984
01:42:04,350 --> 01:42:04,360
do it again. Are you feeling like you're doing it? Relay.
 

2985
01:42:04,360 --> 01:42:08,790
do it again. Are you feeling like you're doing it? Relay.
No, no, no, no. Okay. Just now, I

2986
01:42:08,790 --> 01:42:08,800
No, no, no, no. Okay. Just now, I
 

2987
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:11,390
No, no, no, no. Okay. Just now, I
took the bread from Maa's Relay. Just now.

2988
01:42:11,390 --> 01:42:11,400
took the bread from Maa's Relay. Just now.
 

2989
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:13,830
took the bread from Maa's Relay. Just now.
But I can't eat it right now, right? I

2990
01:42:13,830 --> 01:42:13,840
But I can't eat it right now, right? I
 

2991
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:16,750
But I can't eat it right now, right? I
can't eat it until I start that game. I

2992
01:42:16,750 --> 01:42:16,760
can't eat it until I start that game. I
 

2993
01:42:16,760 --> 01:42:19,669
can't eat it until I start that game. I
eat it by right-clicking and right-clicking normally. I

2994
01:42:19,669 --> 01:42:19,679
eat it by right-clicking and right-clicking normally. I
 

2995
01:42:19,679 --> 01:42:23,109
eat it by right-clicking and right-clicking normally. I
click and there's snow behind that icy place. If I

2996
01:42:23,109 --> 01:42:23,119
click and there's snow behind that icy place. If I
 

2997
01:42:23,119 --> 01:42:25,950
click and there's snow behind that icy place. If I
do that, I think I'll be able to jump over it. I'll

2998
01:42:25,950 --> 01:42:25,960
do that, I think I'll be able to jump over it. I'll
 

2999
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:27,990
do that, I think I'll be able to jump over it. I'll
be able to jump over it all.  Well, no, no, you

3000
01:42:27,990 --> 01:42:28,000
be able to jump over it all.  Well, no, no, you
 

3001
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:32,070
be able to jump over it all.  Well, no, no, you
can jump over it. If the timing is right,

3002
01:42:32,070 --> 01:42:32,080
can jump over it. If the timing is right,
 

3003
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:35,350
can jump over it. If the timing is right,
press and hold just that last line. It's

3004
01:42:35,350 --> 01:42:35,360
press and hold just that last line. It's
 

3005
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:37,350
press and hold just that last line. It's
almost like this. That's right, that's right

3006
01:42:37,350 --> 01:42:37,360
almost like this. That's right, that's right
 

3007
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:43,310
almost like this. That's right, that's right
, that's important. That's important, that's important, isn't it?

3008
01:42:43,310 --> 01:42:47,560
, that's important. That's important, that's important, isn't it?
 

3009
01:42:47,560 --> 01:42:47,570

 

3010
01:42:47,570 --> 01:42:49,750

[Applause] It's

3011
01:42:49,750 --> 01:42:49,760
[Applause] It's
 

3012
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:53,070
[Applause] It's
Iris, so all you have to do is hit it repeatedly like I'm told.The

3013
01:42:53,070 --> 01:42:53,080
Iris, so all you have to do is hit it repeatedly like I'm told.The
 

3014
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:54,950
Iris, so all you have to do is hit it repeatedly like I'm told.The

3015
01:42:54,950 --> 01:42:57,310

 

3016
01:42:57,310 --> 01:43:02,550

 

3017
01:43:02,550 --> 01:43:02,560

 

3018
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:06,910

power of God is coming from the power of flying.It's going to make a big difference.I'm

3019
01:43:06,910 --> 01:43:06,920
power of God is coming from the power of flying.It's going to make a big difference.I'm
 

3020
01:43:06,920 --> 01:43:09,270
power of God is coming from the power of flying.It's going to make a big difference.I'm
sure that's how all the other teams are

3021
01:43:09,270 --> 01:43:09,280
sure that's how all the other teams are
 

3022
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:11,750
sure that's how all the other teams are
doing it.  It pops out like a

3023
01:43:11,750 --> 01:43:11,760
doing it.  It pops out like a
 

3024
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:14,229
doing it.  It pops out like a

3025
01:43:14,229 --> 01:43:14,239

 

3026
01:43:14,239 --> 01:43:16,790


3027
01:43:16,790 --> 01:43:16,800

 

3028
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:18,550


3029
01:43:18,550 --> 01:43:18,560

 

3030
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:22,390

walnut, wow, haha, it collides with me, so what's the best

3031
01:43:22,390 --> 01:43:22,400
walnut, wow, haha, it collides with me, so what's the best
 

3032
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:25,070
walnut, wow, haha, it collides with me, so what's the best
part? Tell me, tell me, where's the one in the middle

3033
01:43:25,070 --> 01:43:25,080
part? Tell me, tell me, where's the one in the middle
 

3034
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:29,750
part? Tell me, tell me, where's the one in the middle
? Well, I've been to a lot of places, but to be honest, the nest of clouds is...  You can

3035
01:43:29,750 --> 01:43:33,750
? Well, I've been to a lot of places, but to be honest, the nest of clouds is...  You can
 

3036
01:43:33,750 --> 01:43:33,760

 

3037
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:37,870

go anywhere and you won't get caught. The trick is not to go diagonally

3038
01:43:37,870 --> 01:43:37,880
go anywhere and you won't get caught. The trick is not to go diagonally
 

3039
01:43:37,880 --> 01:43:40,430
go anywhere and you won't get caught. The trick is not to go diagonally
. It's better to go straight diagonally. There will

3040
01:43:40,430 --> 01:43:40,440
. It's better to go straight diagonally. There will
 

3041
01:43:40,440 --> 01:43:45,390
. It's better to go straight diagonally. There will
come a time when you really need to turn straight. As much as possible, there's

3042
01:43:45,390 --> 01:43:45,400
come a time when you really need to turn straight. As much as possible, there's
 

3043
01:43:45,400 --> 01:43:46,629
come a time when you really need to turn straight. As much as possible, there's

3044
01:43:46,629 --> 01:43:46,639

 

3045
01:43:46,639 --> 01:43:51,070

something on the far right that gets in the way.  It's

3046
01:43:51,070 --> 01:43:51,080
something on the far right that gets in the way.  It's
 

3047
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:53,990
something on the far right that gets in the way.  It's
not diagonal, so you

3048
01:43:53,990 --> 01:43:54,000
not diagonal, so you
 

3049
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,430
not diagonal, so you
can just push straight on the far right one.The

3050
01:43:56,430 --> 01:43:56,440
can just push straight on the far right one.The
 

3051
01:43:56,440 --> 01:44:00,149
can just push straight on the far right one.The
outer one is better.I feel like the inner left side is probably

3052
01:44:00,149 --> 01:44:00,159
outer one is better.I feel like the inner left side is probably
 

3053
01:44:00,159 --> 01:44:06,070
outer one is better.I feel like the inner left side is probably
faster.That's right.  It's

3054
01:44:06,070 --> 01:44:06,080
faster.That's right.  It's
 

3055
01:44:06,080 --> 01:44:08,669
faster.That's right.  It's
easier to do it on the right side,

3056
01:44:08,669 --> 01:44:08,679
easier to do it on the right side,
 

3057
01:44:08,679 --> 01:44:11,990
easier to do it on the right side,
but it's faster on the left side.Maybe it's

3058
01:44:11,990 --> 01:44:12,000
but it's faster on the left side.Maybe it's
 

3059
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:16,589
but it's faster on the left side.Maybe it's
easier to hit on the left side, but it's easier to hit on that side, but it's

3060
01:44:16,589 --> 01:44:16,599
easier to hit on the left side, but it's easier to hit on that side, but it's
 

3061
01:44:16,599 --> 01:44:23,390
easier to hit on the left side, but it's easier to hit on that side, but it's
faster.Can you

3062
01:44:23,390 --> 01:44:23,400
faster.Can you
 

3063
01:44:23,400 --> 01:44:26,070
faster.Can you
take a look at my drawing?  I

3064
01:44:26,070 --> 01:44:29,990
take a look at my drawing?  I
 

3065
01:44:29,990 --> 01:44:33,270

 

3066
01:44:33,270 --> 01:44:33,280

Tanya, if you turn like this.

3072
01:44:44,550 --> 01:44:48,709

 

3073
01:44:48,709 --> 01:44:52,350

 

3074
01:44:52,350 --> 01:44:55,589

 

3075
01:44:55,589 --> 01:44:58,229

 

3076
01:44:58,229 --> 01:44:58,239

 

3077
01:44:58,239 --> 01:45:01,950

That's too good to be true, right? That's right, make a video, make a video, make a video, make a video, go through this diagonally, and then you'll go 100% upside down and diagonally, and if you try to go through it like this, you'll get stuck, right? You

3078
01:45:01,950 --> 01:45:01,960
That's too good to be true, right? That's right, make a video, make a video, make a video, make a video, go through this diagonally, and then you'll go 100% upside down and diagonally, and if you try to go through it like this, you'll get stuck, right? You
 

3079

That's too good to be true, right? That's right, make a video, make a video, make a video, make a video, go through this diagonally, and then you'll go 100% upside down and diagonally, and if you try to go through it like this, you'll get stuck, right? You
have to do it like this.  You have to go straight.

3080
01:45:04,070 --> 01:45:04,080
have to do it like this.  You have to go straight.
 

3081
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:07,229
have to do it like this.  You have to go straight.
That's right. If you don't move so you can see the spider's nest right in front of the book, you'll

3082
01:45:07,229 --> 01:45:07,239
That's right. If you don't move so you can see the spider's nest right in front of the book, you'll
 

3083
01:45:07,239 --> 01:45:09,790
That's right. If you don't move so you can see the spider's nest right in front of the book, you'll
hit it.

3084
01:45:09,790 --> 01:45:09,800
hit it.
 

3085
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:13,109
hit it.
Ah, I see. It's true that it's a trout after all.  I'm

3086
01:45:13,109 --> 01:45:13,119
Ah, I see. It's true that it's a trout after all.  I'm
 

3087
01:45:13,119 --> 01:45:17,750
Ah, I see. It's true that it's a trout after all.  I'm
judging because Minecraft doesn't have any diagonals. That's helpful.

3088
01:45:17,750 --> 01:45:21,830
judging because Minecraft doesn't have any diagonals. That's helpful.
 

3089
01:45:21,830 --> 01:45:21,840

 

3090
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:26,149

If someone has recorded it, please record it later and

3091
01:45:26,149 --> 01:45:26,159
If someone has recorded it, please record it later and
 

3092
01:45:26,159 --> 01:45:30,790
If someone has recorded it, please record it later and
give it to me. I hope you can help me.

3093
01:45:30,790 --> 01:45:30,800
give it to me. I hope you can help me.
 

3094
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:33,109
give it to me. I hope you can help me.
Actually, there is a way to almost get there without bumping into anything.

3095
01:45:33,109 --> 01:45:36,830
Actually, there is a way to almost get there without bumping into anything.
 

3096
01:45:36,830 --> 01:45:36,840

 

3097
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:41,550

Is there a way to avoid hitting the pool pool? The strategy is too bad. It's

3098
01:45:41,550 --> 01:45:41,560
Is there a way to avoid hitting the pool pool? The strategy is too bad. It's
 

3099
01:45:41,560 --> 01:45:45,629
Is there a way to avoid hitting the pool pool? The strategy is too bad. It's
too bad. I want to go to the bottom.

3100
01:45:45,629 --> 01:45:45,639
too bad. I want to go to the bottom.
 

3101
01:45:45,639 --> 01:45:51,510
too bad. I want to go to the bottom.
When I write anything other than number 1, I write those three letters in succession except for the bottom one.

3102
01:45:51,510 --> 01:45:51,520
When I write anything other than number 1, I write those three letters in succession except for the bottom one.
 

3103
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:55,950
When I write anything other than number 1, I write those three letters in succession except for the bottom one.
Okay, so there are three main lines,

3104
01:45:55,950 --> 01:45:55,960
Okay, so there are three main lines,
 

3105
01:45:55,960 --> 01:46:00,310
Okay, so there are three main lines,
but if you

3106
01:46:00,310 --> 01:46:00,320
but if you
 

3107
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:02,270
but if you
go all the way to the bottom, you'll never hit

3108
01:46:02,270 --> 01:46:02,280
go all the way to the bottom, you'll never hit
 

3109
01:46:02,280 --> 01:46:07,589
go all the way to the bottom, you'll never hit
anything other than that one, which is amazing.  It's

3110
01:46:07,589 --> 01:46:07,599
anything other than that one, which is amazing.  It's
 

3111
01:46:07,599 --> 01:46:11,950
anything other than that one, which is amazing.  It's
easy to collide in the middle,

3112
01:46:11,950 --> 01:46:11,960
easy to collide in the middle,
 

3113
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:14,830
easy to collide in the middle,
so it sinks to the bottom, and when the bottom comes, it

3114
01:46:14,830 --> 01:46:14,840
so it sinks to the bottom, and when the bottom comes, it
 

3115
01:46:14,840 --> 01:46:17,830
so it sinks to the bottom, and when the bottom comes, it
goes up.If it goes up, it won't be that bad.Basically, all you have to do is stay at the bottom.If it's at the

3116
01:46:17,830 --> 01:46:17,840
goes up.If it goes up, it won't be that bad.Basically, all you have to do is stay at the bottom.If it's at the
 

3117
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:22,470
goes up.If it goes up, it won't be that bad.Basically, all you have to do is stay at the bottom.If it's at the
bottom, it'll be up.The

3118
01:46:22,470 --> 01:46:22,480
bottom, it'll be up.The
 

3119
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:29,430
bottom, it'll be up.The
analysis team is here!This is amazing!

3120
01:46:29,430 --> 01:46:29,440

 

3121
01:46:29,440 --> 01:46:33,910

Basically, you don't have to hit anything other than the bottom, and even

3122
01:46:33,910 --> 01:46:33,920
Basically, you don't have to hit anything other than the bottom, and even
 

3123
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:36,589
Basically, you don't have to hit anything other than the bottom, and even
if you hit at the bottom, if you

3124
01:46:36,589 --> 01:46:36,599
if you hit at the bottom, if you
 

3125
01:46:36,599 --> 01:46:38,870
if you hit at the bottom, if you
press space just a little, you can come up, so I

3126
01:46:38,870 --> 01:46:38,880
press space just a little, you can come up, so I
 

3127
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:40,750
press space just a little, you can come up, so I
think you can go a little forward without hitting that much. Yeah, that's

3128
01:46:40,750 --> 01:46:40,760
think you can go a little forward without hitting that much. Yeah, that's
 

3129
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:44,669
think you can go a little forward without hitting that much. Yeah, that's
great. I'm sure I've

3130
01:46:44,669 --> 01:46:44,679
great. I'm sure I've
 

3131
01:46:44,679 --> 01:46:48,830
great. I'm sure I've
tried this once.  The one at the bottom

3132
01:46:48,830 --> 01:46:48,840
tried this once.  The one at the bottom
 

3133
01:46:48,840 --> 01:46:52,709
tried this once.  The one at the bottom
is stable, it's stable, it's true, it's coming, but it's coming, but it

3134
01:46:52,709 --> 01:46:52,719
is stable, it's stable, it's true, it's coming, but it's coming, but it
 

3135
01:46:52,719 --> 01:46:56,390
is stable, it's stable, it's true, it's coming, but it's coming, but it
's stable, it's true that it's

3136
01:46:56,390 --> 01:46:56,400
's stable, it's true that it's
 

3137
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:59,030
's stable, it's true that it's
faster to just watch the timing and fly instead of running in the cherry blossom area.On the other hand,

3138
01:46:59,030 --> 01:46:59,040
faster to just watch the timing and fly instead of running in the cherry blossom area.On the other hand,
 

3139
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:02,550
faster to just watch the timing and fly instead of running in the cherry blossom area.On the other hand,
that's a stupid character, isn't it?Yeah, it's a fish.

3140
01:47:02,550 --> 01:47:02,560
that's a stupid character, isn't it?Yeah, it's a fish.
 

3141
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:05,189
that's a stupid character, isn't it?Yeah, it's a fish.
As for that, it

3142
01:47:05,189 --> 01:47:05,199
As for that, it
 

3143
01:47:05,199 --> 01:47:07,589
As for that, it
might be better not to worry too much about jumping.Jump dash is the

3144
01:47:07,589 --> 01:47:07,599
might be better not to worry too much about jumping.Jump dash is the
 

3145
01:47:07,599 --> 01:47:10,109
might be better not to worry too much about jumping.Jump dash is the
fastest, but if you jump dash, you will fail a lot.Oh

3146
01:47:10,109 --> 01:47:10,119
fastest, but if you jump dash, you will fail a lot.Oh
 

3147
01:47:10,119 --> 01:47:12,589
fastest, but if you jump dash, you will fail a lot.Oh
yeah, I don't know the timing, so you'll

3148
01:47:12,589 --> 01:47:12,599
yeah, I don't know the timing, so you'll
 

3149
01:47:12,599 --> 01:47:15,550
yeah, I don't know the timing, so you'll
run out.Maybe when you get to the stairs,

3150
01:47:15,550 --> 01:47:15,560
run out.Maybe when you get to the stairs,
 

3151
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:19,109
run out.Maybe when you get to the stairs,
jump for the first time, then press and hold to

3152
01:47:19,109 --> 01:47:19,119
jump for the first time, then press and hold to
 

3153
01:47:19,119 --> 01:47:22,149
jump for the first time, then press and hold to
go straight.  Yeah, I think I'm doing something that I think will be able to fly next time because of the length of the jump.Ah, the

3154
01:47:22,149 --> 01:47:26,830
go straight.  Yeah, I think I'm doing something that I think will be able to fly next time because of the length of the jump.Ah, the

can't move, after all. I
 

3773
02:07:02,440 --> 02:07:04,709
can't move, after all. I
like the empty style of running around. I was

like the empty style of running around. I was
 

3775
02:07:04,719 --> 02:07:07,229

What was it like? I was caught, right? Yes, I
was able to run away once, but then I got caught. But

3782
02:07:15,030 --> 02:07:15,040
was able to run away once, but then I got caught. But
 

3783
02:07:15,040 --> 02:07:17,270

02:07:18,549 --> 02:07:18,559
fine. I do
 

3787
02:07:18,559 --> 02:07:21,189

02:07:21,189 --> 02:07:21,199
n't know who the demon is, but if I head towards it, I'll
 

3789
02:07:21,199 --> 02:07:25,109
n't know who the demon is, but if I head towards it, I'll
get caught. Ah, I'll definitely turn around.  Now, I don't

3790
02:07:25,109 --> 02:07:25,119
get caught. Ah, I'll definitely turn around.  Now, I don't
 

3791
02:07:25,119 --> 02:07:26,990
get caught. Ah, I'll definitely turn around.  Now, I don't
know who the demon is. I don't know at all,

3792
02:07:26,990 --> 02:07:27,000
know who the demon is. I don't know at all,
 

3793
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,990
know who the demon is. I don't know at all,
so I'm going to be that true side. Oh, that's

3794
02:07:29,990 --> 02:07:30,000
so I'm going to be that true side. Oh, that's
 

3795
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:34,669
so I'm going to be that true side. Oh, that's
too true.

3796
02:07:34,669 --> 02:07:34,679
too true.
 

3797
02:07:34,679 --> 02:07:37,549
too true.
The moment Noel and I laid eyes on each other, I was ready to die.  I

3798
02:07:37,549 --> 02:07:37,559
The moment Noel and I laid eyes on each other, I was ready to die.  I
 

3799
02:07:37,559 --> 02:07:43,350
The moment Noel and I laid eyes on each other, I was ready to die.  I
thought it was over, but it's true,

3800
02:07:43,350 --> 02:07:43,360
thought it was over, but it's true,
 

3801
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:46,350
thought it was over, but it's true,
so please give it to me. I was captured. I was prepared. I guess I

3802
02:07:46,350 --> 02:07:46,360
so please give it to me. I was captured. I was prepared. I guess I
 

3803
02:07:46,360 --> 02:07:50,310
so please give it to me. I was captured. I was prepared. I guess I
was standing. There's

3804
02:07:50,310 --> 02:07:50,320
was standing. There's
 

3805
02:07:50,320 --> 02:07:53,589
was standing. There's
no more. Yeah, this will probably

3806
02:07:53,589 --> 02:07:53,599
no more. Yeah, this will probably
 

3807
02:07:53,599 --> 02:07:57,910
no more. Yeah, this will probably
be the end of the hunt, so yeah, I'll scream. I

3808
02:07:57,910 --> 02:07:57,920
be the end of the hunt, so yeah, I'll scream. I
 

3809
02:07:57,920 --> 02:08:01,709
be the end of the hunt, so yeah, I'll scream. I
want to do it.  Please, I want to become one as soon as possible.

3810
02:08:01,709 --> 02:08:01,719
want to do it.  Please, I want to become one as soon as possible.
 

3811
02:08:01,719 --> 02:08:03,549
want to do it.  Please, I want to become one as soon as possible.
If you wait a little,

3812
02:08:03,549 --> 02:08:03,559
If you wait a little,
 

3813
02:08:03,559 --> 02:08:05,709
If you wait a little,
I'll chat with you once. The next voice is good. The

3814
02:08:05,709 --> 02:08:07,750
I'll chat with you once. The next voice is good. The
 

3815
02:08:07,750 --> 02:08:07,760

 

3816
02:08:07,760 --> 02:08:13,149

next voice is good.

3817
02:08:13,149 --> 02:08:13,159

Who is the voice of Kapipi?  I've

3819
02:08:16,069 --> 02:08:20,189
Who is the voice of Kapipi?  I've
 

3820
02:08:20,189 --> 02:08:23,109

 

3821
02:08:23,109 --> 02:08:23,119

 

3822
02:08:23,119 --> 02:08:27,109

become a princess. I've become a princess. Only the

3823
02:08:27,109 --> 02:08:27,119
become a princess. I've become a princess. Only the
 

3824
02:08:27,119 --> 02:08:31,510
become a princess. I've become a princess. Only the
characters match. I'm

3825
02:08:31,510 --> 02:08:31,520
characters match. I'm
 

3826
02:08:31,520 --> 02:08:35,350
characters match. I'm
sure even Miko has started both of them, so

3827
02:08:35,350 --> 02:08:35,360
sure even Miko has started both of them, so
 

3828
02:08:35,360 --> 02:08:40,910
sure even Miko has started both of them, so
that's all they have in common. I

3829
02:08:40,910 --> 02:08:40,920

 

3830
02:08:40,920 --> 02:08:44,750

came to read you, but something was missing.

3831
02:08:44,750 --> 02:08:44,760
came to read you, but something was missing.
 

3832
02:08:44,760 --> 02:08:45,669
came to read you, but something was missing.
Miko,

3833
02:08:45,669 --> 02:08:45,679
Miko,
 

3834
02:08:45,679 --> 02:08:49,990
Miko,
Chimiko-senpai can hear it.  I can't hear you, Miko-senpai,

3835
02:08:49,990 --> 02:08:50,000
Chimiko-senpai can hear it.  I can't hear you, Miko-senpai,
 

3836
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:54,109
Chimiko-senpai can hear it.  I can't hear you, Miko-senpai,
right? I

3837
02:08:54,109 --> 02:08:54,119
right? I
 

3838
02:08:54,119 --> 02:08:57,350
right? I
can't hear you, Michi. Goodbye, Miko-senpai has gone here. I can't

3839
02:08:57,350 --> 02:08:57,360
can't hear you, Michi. Goodbye, Miko-senpai has gone here. I can't
 

3840
02:08:57,360 --> 02:09:02,189
can't hear you, Michi. Goodbye, Miko-senpai has gone here. I can't
see you. I can see Miko, but she's still alive.

3841
02:09:02,189 --> 02:09:05,750
see you. I can see Miko, but she's still alive.
 

3842
02:09:05,750 --> 02:09:08,430

 

3843
02:09:08,430 --> 02:09:08,440

 

3844
02:09:08,440 --> 02:09:10,910

Wait a minute, I'm Subaru here.

3845
02:09:10,910 --> 02:09:10,920
Wait a minute, I'm Subaru here.
 

3846
02:09:10,920 --> 02:09:14,589
Wait a minute, I'm Subaru here.
Wait a minute. There's nothing below this.

3847
02:09:14,589 --> 02:09:14,599
Wait a minute. There's nothing below this.
 

3848
02:09:14,599 --> 02:09:17,990
Wait a minute. There's nothing below this.
And I'm pretty sure it's just long so it won't fall. It's

3849
02:09:17,990 --> 02:09:18,000
And I'm pretty sure it's just long so it won't fall. It's
 

3850
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:18,830
And I'm pretty sure it's just long so it won't fall. It's

3851
02:09:18,830 --> 02:09:18,840

 

3852
02:09:18,840 --> 02:09:21,830

long, so I pulled out a little at the end.

3853
02:09:21,830 --> 02:09:21,840
long, so I pulled out a little at the end.
 

3854
02:09:21,840 --> 02:09:26,549
long, so I pulled out a little at the end.
Maybe I should go to the right at the end.  There's plenty of room,

3855
02:09:26,549 --> 02:09:26,559
Maybe I should go to the right at the end.  There's plenty of room,
 

3856
02:09:26,559 --> 02:09:30,990
Maybe I should go to the right at the end.  There's plenty of room,
but I'm not going to run that way, Pol.

3857
02:09:30,990 --> 02:09:31,000

 

3858
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:34,910

Maybe the pool is the easiest way to go. That's

3859
02:09:34,910 --> 02:09:34,920
Maybe the pool is the easiest way to go. That's
 

3860
02:09:34,920 --> 02:09:37,629
Maybe the pool is the easiest way to go. That's
what I came for. I

3861
02:09:37,629 --> 02:09:37,639
what I came for. I
 

3862
02:09:37,639 --> 02:09:39,870
what I came for. I

3863
02:09:39,870 --> 02:09:39,880

 

3864
02:09:39,880 --> 02:09:42,270


3865
02:09:42,270 --> 02:09:47,310

 

3866
02:09:47,310 --> 02:09:47,320

 

3867
02:09:47,320 --> 02:09:52,270

heard laughter. Subaru Oh, that's right. Let's

3868
02:09:52,270 --> 02:09:52,280

02:09:57,549 --> 02:10:02,069

 

3872
02:10:02,069 --> 02:10:04,669

 

3873
02:10:04,669 --> 02:10:04,679

 

3874
02:10:04,679 --> 02:10:08,430

just go to Wani, then I'll cut off the polka stream soon. I'll be practicing, but I was streaming it. I'll also stream it, and then I'll cut it off. It's about time. If I just cut that frame and practice, I

3875
02:10:08,430 --> 02:10:08,440
just go to Wani, then I'll cut off the polka stream soon. I'll be practicing, but I was streaming it. I'll also stream it, and then I'll cut it off. It's about time. If I just cut that frame and practice, I

just go to Wani, then I'll cut off the polka stream soon. I'll be practicing, but I was streaming it. I'll also stream it, and then I'll cut it off. It's about time. If I just cut that frame and practice, I
'll just practice in a different place.

3877
02:10:11,990 --> 02:10:12,000
'll just practice in a different place.
 

3878
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,790
'll just practice in a different place.
Well, I'm going to go to the darkroom first. I

3879
02:10:14,790 --> 02:10:14,800
Well, I'm going to go to the darkroom first. I
 

3880
02:10:14,800 --> 02:10:16,669
Well, I'm going to go to the darkroom first. I
think anyone who wants to do it can do it. I

3881
02:10:16,669 --> 02:10:16,679
think anyone who wants to do it can do it. I
 

3882
02:10:16,679 --> 02:10:18,910
think anyone who wants to do it can do it. I
think anyone who wants to do it can do it at all. Maybe I'll

3883
02:10:18,910 --> 02:10:18,920
think anyone who wants to do it can do it at all. Maybe I'll
 

3884
02:10:18,920 --> 02:10:20,870
think anyone who wants to do it can do it at all. Maybe I'll
cut out the frame and bring it over here. I

3885
02:10:20,870 --> 02:10:20,880
cut out the frame and bring it over here. I
 

3886
02:10:20,880 --> 02:10:23,310
cut out the frame and bring it over here. I
'll go over for a moment. Oh yeah.

3887
02:10:23,310 --> 02:10:23,320
'll go over for a moment. Oh yeah.
 

3888
02:10:23,320 --> 02:10:27,880
'll go over for a moment. Oh yeah.
Well, let's just leave it at that.

3889
02:10:27,880 --> 02:10:27,890
Well, let's just leave it at that.

true. The screen shakes quite a bit.
On the contrary, it's jumping

On the contrary, it's jumping
 

3906
02:11:03,360 --> 02:11:07,549
On the contrary, it's jumping
up and down, so it's all the better. Is it up? If it's up, it might be too much. It's my intention, so it's

I'll ask you a few questions.  Oh, I'm sorry, I
 

4103
02:17:35,120 --> 02:17:39,230
I'll ask you a few questions.  Oh, I'm sorry, I
have one more question, but what is that? You

4104
02:17:39,230 --> 02:17:39,240
have one more question, but what is that? You
 

4105
02:17:39,240 --> 02:17:41,790
have one more question, but what is that? You
make something and guess what it is.

4106
02:17:41,790 --> 02:17:41,800
make something and guess what it is.
 

4107
02:17:41,800 --> 02:17:46,150
make something and guess what it is.
But, uh, the knights are

4108
02:17:46,150 --> 02:17:46,160
But, uh, the knights are
 

4109
02:17:46,160 --> 02:17:49,429
But, uh, the knights are
not allowed to talk, right? Basically, one more thing.  It's

4110
02:17:49,429 --> 02:17:49,439
not allowed to talk, right? Basically, one more thing.  It's
 

4111
02:17:49,439 --> 02:17:53,349
not allowed to talk, right? Basically, one more thing.  It's
nice to have a voice like that,

4112
02:17:53,349 --> 02:17:53,359
nice to have a voice like that,
 

4113
02:17:53,359 --> 02:17:56,629
nice to have a voice like that,
but I wonder if words like this, this, that, this, that, the

4114
02:17:56,629 --> 02:17:56,639
but I wonder if words like this, this, that, this, that, the
 

4115
02:17:56,639 --> 02:17:59,870
but I wonder if words like this, this, that, this, that, the
usual, etc.

4116
02:17:59,870 --> 02:17:59,880
usual, etc.
 

4117
02:17:59,880 --> 02:18:02,469
usual, etc.
will probably get across. Yeah, yeah, yes, here. There's

4118
02:18:02,469 --> 02:18:02,479
will probably get across. Yeah, yeah, yes, here. There's
 

4119
02:18:02,479 --> 02:18:06,429
will probably get across. Yeah, yeah, yes, here. There's
no such thing as putting green here.

4120
02:18:06,429 --> 02:18:06,439
no such thing as putting green here.
 

4121
02:18:06,439 --> 02:18:09,110
no such thing as putting green here.
So in that case.  Yes, it's okay for the princess to talk. It's

4122
02:18:09,110 --> 02:18:09,120
So in that case.  Yes, it's okay for the princess to talk. It's
 

4123
02:18:09,120 --> 02:18:12,429
So in that case.  Yes, it's okay for the princess to talk. It's
okay for the princess to talk, too. If the princess was the other way around, then the

4124
02:18:12,429 --> 02:18:14,950
okay for the princess to talk, too. If the princess was the other way around, then the
 

4125
02:18:14,950 --> 02:18:14,960

 

4126
02:18:14,960 --> 02:18:18,150

knight would shake his head and ask, "Is that a refrigerator?"

4127
02:18:18,150 --> 02:18:21,790
knight would shake his head and ask, "Is that a refrigerator?"
 

4128
02:18:21,790 --> 02:18:21,800

 

4129
02:18:21,800 --> 02:18:25,389

Do you feel that you can't nod your head up and down? Yes, it's true, it's

4130
02:18:25,389 --> 02:18:25,399
Do you feel that you can't nod your head up and down? Yes, it's true, it's
 

4131
02:18:25,399 --> 02:18:28,910
Do you feel that you can't nod your head up and down? Yes, it's true, it's
no good. It's okay if it's not a word. It's okay if it's not a word. It's no good.

4132
02:18:28,910 --> 02:18:28,920
no good. It's okay if it's not a word. It's okay if it's not a word. It's no good.
 

4133
02:18:28,920 --> 02:18:31,790
no good. It's okay if it's not a word. It's okay if it's not a word. It's no good.
That's like an answer.

4134
02:18:31,790 --> 02:18:33,150
That's like an answer.
 

4135
02:18:33,150 --> 02:18:33,160

 

4136
02:18:33,160 --> 02:18:37,750

By the way, that princess's voice...  Things like the theme

4137
02:18:37,750 --> 02:18:37,760
By the way, that princess's voice...  Things like the theme
 

4138
02:18:37,760 --> 02:18:42,509
By the way, that princess's voice...  Things like the theme
change on the day of the day.Higo's theme is about cooking.The

4139
02:18:42,509 --> 02:18:46,070
change on the day of the day.Higo's theme is about cooking.The
 

4140
02:18:46,070 --> 02:18:48,349

 

4141
02:18:48,349 --> 02:18:48,359

 

4142
02:18:48,359 --> 02:18:51,190

first half of the story is not exactly the same, after all, it's

4143
02:18:51,190 --> 02:18:51,200
first half of the story is not exactly the same, after all, it's
 

4144
02:18:51,200 --> 02:18:53,270
first half of the story is not exactly the same, after all, it's
random.  Miko also

4145
02:18:53,270 --> 02:18:56,429
random.  Miko also
 

4146
02:18:56,429 --> 02:18:58,750

 

4147
02:18:58,750 --> 02:18:58,760

 

4148
02:18:58,760 --> 02:19:01,669

thinks that if you play with the red team, for example, there will always be a lot of paprika or a lot of refrigerators, but

4149
02:19:01,669 --> 02:19:01,679
thinks that if you play with the red team, for example, there will always be a lot of paprika or a lot of refrigerators, but
 

4150
02:19:01,679 --> 02:19:04,549
thinks that if you play with the red team, for example, there will always be a lot of paprika or a lot of refrigerators, but
yeah, that's true, but apparently it's

4151
02:19:04,549 --> 02:19:04,559
yeah, that's true, but apparently it's
 

4152
02:19:04,559 --> 02:19:06,790
yeah, that's true, but apparently it's
random, so I

4153
02:19:06,790 --> 02:19:06,800
random, so I
 

4154
02:19:06,800 --> 02:19:09,190
random, so I
do it for Radam.  I don't really understand it, but it seems like some

4155
02:19:09,190 --> 02:19:09,200
do it for Radam.  I don't really understand it, but it seems like some
 

4156
02:19:09,200 --> 02:19:11,910
do it for Radam.  I don't really understand it, but it seems like some
random person is getting angry,

4157
02:19:11,910 --> 02:19:11,920
random person is getting angry,
 

4158
02:19:11,920 --> 02:19:16,669
random person is getting angry,
so I guess that means that the topic for that day is the same as the one that's coming out right now,

4159
02:19:16,669 --> 02:19:16,679
so I guess that means that the topic for that day is the same as the one that's coming out right now,
 

4160
02:19:16,679 --> 02:19:19,950
so I guess that means that the topic for that day is the same as the one that's coming out right now,
and there's a chance that the same thing will come up again.

4161
02:19:19,950 --> 02:19:24,270
and there's a chance that the same thing will come up again.
 

4162
02:19:24,270 --> 02:19:24,280

 

4163
02:19:24,280 --> 02:19:27,830

By the way, the person who makes that creative thing,

4164
02:19:27,830 --> 02:19:27,840
By the way, the person who makes that creative thing,
 

4165
02:19:27,840 --> 02:19:31,669
By the way, the person who makes that creative thing,
uh, the first half isn't that different, but the second

4166
02:19:31,669 --> 02:19:31,679
uh, the first half isn't that different, but the second
 

4167
02:19:31,679 --> 02:19:36,349
uh, the first half isn't that different, but the second
question is that there will be a special topic for that day.

4168
02:19:36,349 --> 02:19:40,070
question is that there will be a special topic for that day.
 

4169
02:19:40,070 --> 02:19:42,990

 

4170
02:19:42,990 --> 02:19:43,000

 

4171
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:46,150

Yes,

4172
02:19:46,150 --> 02:19:48,110
Yes,
 

4173
02:19:48,110 --> 02:19:48,120

 

4174
02:19:48,120 --> 02:19:52,510

yes, I'm excited. Yes, there are some changes, but they're

4175
02:19:52,510 --> 02:19:52,520
yes, I'm excited. Yes, there are some changes, but they're
 

4176
02:19:52,520 --> 02:19:55,110
yes, I'm excited. Yes, there are some changes, but they're
not going to interfere with that. Yes, it's

4177
02:19:55,110 --> 02:19:55,120
not going to interfere with that. Yes, it's
 

4178
02:19:55,120 --> 02:19:58,510
not going to interfere with that. Yes, it's
okay.

4179
02:19:58,510 --> 02:19:58,520
okay.
 

4180
02:19:58,520 --> 02:20:00,170
okay.

4181
02:20:00,170 --> 02:20:00,180

4438
02:28:15,680 --> 02:28:19,269

nothing I can do about it. If I go up, it's
