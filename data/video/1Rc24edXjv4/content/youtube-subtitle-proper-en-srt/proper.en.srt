00:00:01,085 --> 00:00:01,885
​​​ ​I... I...​ ​​

3
00:00:01,885 --> 00:00:02,419
​​​ ​I...​ ​​

4
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:05,356
​​​ ​I can't do it! Aaargh!​ ​​

6
00:00:06,023 --> 00:00:08,258
​​​ ​Japanese Culture School!​ ​​

7
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:11,695
​​​ ​I am your instructor, Tsunomaki Watame.​ ​​

8
00:00:11,695 --> 00:00:14,732
​​​ ​And I, Shishiro Botan, as well.​ ​​

9
00:00:14,732 --> 00:00:18,335
​​​ ​Today we have two students​ ​​
​​ ​who have come from overseas​ ​​

10
00:00:18,335 --> 00:00:23,040
​​​ ​to learn various things about Japan,​ ​​
​​ ​so we shall teach them!​ ​​

11
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,175
​​​ ​That is the gist of this program!​ ​​

12
00:00:25,175 --> 00:00:29,580
​​​ ​I'm Takanashi Kiara from hololive English!​ ​​

13
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:35,185
​​​ ​I am Airani Iofifteen from​ ​​
​​ ​hololive Indonesia's 1st Generation!​ ​​

14
00:00:35,185 --> 00:00:37,354
​​​ ​Both of you are great at Japanese!​ ​​

15
00:00:37,354 --> 00:00:38,389
​​​ ​Right?​ ​​

16
00:00:38,389 --> 00:00:40,491
​​​ ​How did you study Japanese?​ ​​

17
00:00:40,491 --> 00:00:43,660
​​​ ​In my case, books and teachers?​ ​​

18
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:44,862
​​​ ​I didn't use them at all.​ ​​

19
00:00:44,862 --> 00:00:48,632
​​​ ​I learned Japanese just​ ​​
​​ ​by talking to Japanese people.​ ​​

20
00:00:48,232 --> 00:00:50,300
​​​ ​I see! That's amazing!​ ​​

21
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,268
​​​ ​Oh, really!​ ​​

22
00:00:51,268 --> 00:00:55,406
​​​ ​For me, my beloved otome games​ ​​
​​ ​are all in Japanese.​ ​​

23
00:00:55,406 --> 00:00:59,309
​​​ ​At that time, there weren't many​ ​​
​​ ​English versions available.​ ​​

24
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,179
​​​ ​So I was like, "Guess I'll study Japanese!"​ ​​

25
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:03,947
​​​ ​And I did it through passion!​ ​​

26
00:01:03,947 --> 00:01:04,948
​​​ ​Wow!​ ​​

27
00:01:04,948 --> 00:01:10,087
​​​ ​But I still don't really know if the​ ​​
​​ ​Japanese I've learned is really correct or not.​ ​​

28
00:01:10,087 --> 00:01:12,356
​​​ ​Then I suppose that we'll​ ​​

29
00:01:12,356 --> 00:01:13,690
​​​ ​become your teachers!​ ​​

30
00:01:12,356 --> 00:01:13,690
​​​ ​become your teachers!​ ​​

31
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,527
​​​ ​Yes, please!​ ​​

32
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:15,259
​​​ ​Teacher!​ ​​

33
00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:16,527
​​​ ​Please do!​ ​​

34
00:01:16,527 --> 00:01:19,730
​​​ ​Then it's time to start class!​ ​​

35
00:01:20,397 --> 00:01:23,467
​​​ ​The lesson we'll be doing today is this!​ ​​

36
00:01:23,467 --> 00:01:24,568
​​​ ​Ba-dum!​ ​​

37
00:01:24,568 --> 00:01:26,703
​​​ ​Tongue twisters!​ ​​

38
00:01:26,703 --> 00:01:28,906
​​​ ​Do you two know tongue twisters?​ ​​

39
00:01:29,206 --> 00:01:30,641
​​​ ​I do, yeah!​ ​​

40
00:01:29,206 --> 00:01:30,641
​​​ ​I do!​ ​​

41
00:01:30,641 --> 00:01:33,243
​​​ ​ToNgUe TwIsTeRs, is it?​ ​​

42
00:01:33,243 --> 00:01:37,281
​​​ ​There are a lot of funny​ ​​
​​ ​tongue twisters in Japan.​ ​​

43
00:01:37,281 --> 00:01:41,652
​​​ ​So Kiara-chan, Iofi-chan,​ ​​
​​ ​let's fun have learning about them!​ ​​

44
00:01:41,652 --> 00:01:44,054
​​​ ​Ohh!​ ​​

45
00:01:42,653 --> 00:01:44,054
​​​ ​I'm ready!​ ​​

46
00:01:44,054 --> 00:01:47,157
​​​ ​Tongue twister quiz!​ ​​

47
00:01:47,157 --> 00:01:49,593
​​​ ​Yay! Let's start!​ ​​

48
00:01:49,593 --> 00:01:51,995
​​​ ​Yay!​ ​​

49
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:51,995
​​​ ​Quiz?!​ ​​

50
00:01:51,995 --> 00:01:56,900
​​​ ​Watame-senpai will say​ ​​
​​ ​the tongue twister three times first.​ ​​

51
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:01,939
​​​ ​Then, Kiara and Iofi,​ ​​
​​ ​you'll try to guess what Watame said.​ ​​

52
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:03,941
​​​ ​Shall we do the first one?​ ​​

53
00:02:03,941 --> 00:02:06,944
​​​ ​Question 1​ ​​

54
00:02:06,944 --> 00:02:10,881
​​​ ​Now then! What is Watame saying?​ ​​

55
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:17,221
​​​ ​What is Watame-sensei saying?​ ​​
​​ ​Let's all think it over together.​ ​​

56

60
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:14,918
​​​ ​Huh?​ ​​

​​​ ​Theguestnextdoorisaguest​ ​​

62
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:16,019
​​​ ​What?​ ​​

63
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:17,221
​​​ ​What?​ ​​

64
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:19,156
​​​ ​Did you figure out what she said?​ ​​

65
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:19,590
​​​ ​Hold on, hold on, hold on!​ ​​

66
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,557
​​​ ​What was that?​ ​​

67
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:23,093
​​​ ​You understood, right?​ ​​

68
00:02:21,425 --> 00:02:23,093
​​​ ​(pressure)​ ​​

69
00:02:23,093 --> 00:02:24,128
​​​ ​Kiara, you're first.​ ​​

70
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:27,297
​​​ ​I heard something about space.​ ​​

71
00:02:27,297 --> 00:02:28,432
​​​ ​Space?!​ ​​

72
00:02:27,297 --> 00:02:28,432
​​​ ​The next door what?​ ​​

73
00:02:28,832 --> 00:02:30,167
​​​ ​The alien next door?!​ ​​

74
00:02:30,167 --> 00:02:32,936
​​​ ​Looks like you got a little part of it.​ ​​

75
00:02:31,668 --> 00:02:32,936
​​​ ​A little part, yeah.​ ​​

76
00:02:32,936 --> 00:02:34,972
​​​ ​Watame, once more, if you would.​ ​​

77
00:02:34,972 --> 00:02:36,573
​​​ ​Pay attention! Here I go.​ ​​

78
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,408
​​​ ​Theguestnextdoorisaguest​ ​​
​​ ​whoeasalalapersimmons!​ ​​

79
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:44,281
​​​ ​What is Watame-sensei saying?​ ​​
​​ ​Let's all think it over together.​ ​​

80
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,845
​​​ ​The next door @&%$%#$?​ ​​

81
00:02:44,281 --> 00:02:46,250
​​​ ​I mean, she's not wrong.​ ​​

82
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,019
​​​ ​She's basically just parroting​ ​​
​​ ​what Watame is saying.​ ​​

83
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:51,455
​​​ ​Wait? Watame did something wrong?​ ​​

84
00:02:50,287 --> 00:02:51,455
​​​ ​I got it! I got it!​ ​​

85
00:02:51,455 --> 00:02:53,290
​​​ ​Ding ding ding ding ding ding ding!​ ​​

86
00:02:51,955 --> 00:02:52,656
​​​ ​You got it?​ ​​

87
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:54,758
​​​ ​Okay, Kiara-san, go ahead!​ ​​

88
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:59,029
​​​ ​You eat a lot of shaved ice from next door.​ ​​

89
00:03:00,197 --> 00:03:02,199
​​​ ​Oh, close!​ ​​

90
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,901
​​​ ​You're close!​ ​​

91
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,901
​​​ ​Am I?!​ ​​

92
00:03:03,901 --> 00:03:06,303
​​​ ​You say it, Botan-chan!​ ​​

93
00:03:05,402 --> 00:03:06,904
​​​ ​Who, me?​ ​​

94
00:03:06,303 --> 00:03:06,904
​​​ ​Yeah.​ ​​

95
00:03:06,904 --> 00:03:08,772
​​​ ​Fine. Okay, here I go!​ ​​

96
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:11,108
​​​ ​What is Botan-sensei saying?​ ​​

97
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:11,108
​​​ ​The guest next door is a guest​ ​​
​​ ​who eats a lot of persimmons!​ ​​

98
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:12,543
​​​ ​That was good!​ ​​

99
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:13,544
​​​ ​Ohh!​ ​​

100
00:03:12,543 --> 00:03:13,544
​​​ ​Ohh!​ ​​

101
00:03:12,543 --> 00:03:13,544
​​​ ​So good!​ ​​

102
00:03:13,544 --> 00:03:18,248
​​​ ​The guest next door is a guest​ ​​
​​ ​who eats a lot of persimmons!​ ​​

103
00:03:18,248 --> 00:03:19,950
​​​ ​Correct!​ ​​

104
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:21,485
​​​ ​Correct!​ ​​

105
00:03:20,517 --> 00:03:23,554
​​​ ​Ding ding ding!​ ​​

106
00:03:21,985 --> 00:03:23,554
​​​ ​Ding!​ ​​

107
00:03:23,554 --> 00:03:27,991
​​​ ​I couldn't understand what​ ​​
​​ ​you said at all, Watame-senpai!​ ​​

108
00:03:27,991 --> 00:03:31,395
​​​ ​Meaning that my skills still need​ ​​
​​ ​some polishing, huh...​ ​​

109
00:03:31,929 --> 00:03:33,897
​​​ ​Time for ​Kiara ​and ​Iofi to try!​ ​​

110
00:03:33,897 --> 00:03:36,166
​​​ ​The guest next door is a guest​ ​​
​​ ​who eats alaffa...​ ​​

​​​ ​KFP reigns supreme!​ ​​

114
00:03:44,007 --> 00:03:48,145
​​​ ​KFP (Kiara Fried Phoenix):​ ​​
​​ ​The fast-food chain that Kiara runs.​ ​​

115
00:03:44,841 --> 00:03:46,910
​​​ ​Clang clang clang!​ ​​

116
00:03:45,342 --> 00:03:48,145
​​​ ​Yay!​ ​​

​​​ ​The next-door...​ ​​

120
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:57,054
​​​ ​The next-door alien​ ​​
​​ ​doesn't eat persimmons!​ ​​

121
00:03:57,054 --> 00:03:57,521
​​​ ​Yes.​ ​​

122
00:04:00,691 --> 00:04:03,694
​​​ ​Question 2​ ​​

123
00:04:03,694 --> 00:04:06,763
​​​ ​Here's the next tongue twister.​ ​​

124
00:04:06,763 --> 00:04:19,309
​​​ ​What is Watame-sensei saying?​ ​​
​​ ​Let's all think it over together.​ ​​

​​​ ​Oh no! The only thing she got was bamboo!​ ​​

136
00:04:26,917 --> 00:04:28,819
​​​ ​Maybe a little bit slower...​ ​​

137
00:04:28,285 --> 00:04:30,721
​​​ ​Maybe the two of us​ ​​
​​ ​can read it off slowly?​ ​​

138
00:04:30,721 --> 00:04:31,888
​​​ ​Slowly? Okay.​ ​​

139
00:04:31,888 --> 00:04:39,730
​​​ ​Let's all think it over together.​ ​​

​​​ ​I still have no idea, even like that!​ ​​

145
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,636
​​​ ​I felt absolutely no rhythm from that.​ ​​

146
00:04:45,636 --> 00:04:47,337
​​​ ​Read it with some rhythm, then, Watame.​ ​​

147
00:04:47,337 --> 00:04:55,012
​​​ ​What is Watame-sensei saying?​ ​​
​​ ​Let's all think it over together.​ ​​

148
00:04:47,337 --> 00:04:48,338
​​​ ​Yo, yo!​ ​​

149
00:04:48,772 --> 00:04:50,907
​​​ ​I leaned bamboo against this​ ​​
​​ ​bamboo fence because I wanted to​ ​​

150
00:04:50,907 --> 00:04:53,110
​​​ ​lean bamboo against it so​ ​​
​​ ​I leaned bamboo against it!​ ​​

151
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,012
​​​ ​Yo, yo, yo!​ ​​

152
00:04:55,012 --> 00:04:57,147
​​​ ​That was good! Better!​ ​​

153
00:04:57,147 --> 00:04:58,582
​​​ ​Did you get it?!​ ​​

154
00:04:58,582 --> 00:05:00,384
​​​ ​How about you answer with some rhythm?​ ​​

155
00:05:02,619 --> 00:05:04,388
​​​ ​I leaned bamboo against​ ​​

156
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:06,823
​​​ ​this bamboo fence because​ ​​

157
00:05:06,823 --> 00:05:08,125
​​​ ​I...​ ​​

158
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,960
​​​ ​wanted to lean bamboo against it​ ​​

159
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,129
​​​ ​so I leaned bamboo against it.​ ​​

160
00:05:12,129 --> 00:05:13,697
​​​ ​That kinda worked?​ ​​

161
00:05:13,697 --> 00:05:15,332
​​​ ​That works! She got that, right?!​ ​​

162
00:05:15,332 --> 00:05:16,933
​​​ ​This is what you said.​ ​​

163
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:17,834
​​​ ​Bam!​ ​​

164
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:17,834
​​​ ​Bam!​ ​​

165
00:05:17,834 --> 00:05:21,004
​​​ ​I leaned bamboo against this​ ​​
​​ ​bamboo fence because​ ​​

166
00:05:21,004 --> 00:05:22,939
​​​ ​I wanted to lean bamboo against it​ ​​

167
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:24,374
​​​ ​so I leaned bamboo against it.​ ​​

168
00:05:24,374 --> 00:05:25,776
​​​ ​I'd heard this one before,​ ​​

169
00:05:25,776 --> 00:05:27,444
​​​ ​so I kinda figured that was it.​ ​​

170
00:05:27,444 --> 00:05:28,679
​​​ ​I see!​ ​​

171
00:05:29,179 --> 00:05:31,181
​​​ ​Time for ​Kiara ​and ​Iofi to try!​ ​​

172
00:05:31,181 --> 00:05:33,083
​​​ ​I leaned bamboo buhgainst...​ ​​

173
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,885
​​​ ​I leaned bamboo buh-buh...​ ​​

174
00:05:34,885 --> 00:05:35,952
​​​ ​I leaned buh...​ ​​

175
00:05:35,952 --> 00:05:36,820
​​​ ​I... I...​ ​​

176
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,321
​​​ ​I...​ ​​

177
00:05:37,321 --> 00:05:40,090
​​​ ​I can't do it! Aaargh!​ ​​

178
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,560
​​​ ​I'm gonna explode!​ ​​

179
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,362
​​​ ​It's all up to you, Iofi-senpai!​ ​​

180
00:05:45,362 --> 00:05:47,230
​​​ ​Hey, wait!​ ​​

181
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,665
​​​ ​Your expressions!​ ​​

182
00:05:48,665 --> 00:05:50,400
​​​ ​They're lifeless!​ ​​

183
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,069
​​​ ​H-H-Here I go!​ ​​

184
00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:55,138
​​​ ​I leaned bamboo buhgainst​ ​​
​​ ​this bamboo fence because​ ​​

185
00:05:55,138 --> 00:05:58,342
​​​ ​I banted to lean bamboo​ ​​
​​ ​against it, so I leaned...​ ​​

186
00:05:58,342 --> 00:05:59,042
​​​ ​Bamboo?​ ​​

187
00:05:59,042 --> 00:06:00,410
​​​ ​bamboo against it!​ ​​

188
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:06,416
​​​ ​I feel like you handled​ ​​
​​ ​the last one better, Iofi-senpai.​ ​​

189
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:09,486
​​​ ​True...​ ​​

190
00:06:06,883 --> 00:06:09,486
​​​ ​That's because that one was with rhythm.​ ​​

191
00:06:09,486 --> 00:06:13,390
​​​ ​Perhaps your Japanese ability​ ​​
​​ ​has improved after this?​ ​​

192
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:17,027
​​​ ​That's enough of the tongue twisters.​ ​​
​​ ​Let's go to the next lesson!​ ​​

193
00:06:17,828 --> 00:06:20,831
​​​ ​Here's the next lesson we're going to do!​ ​​

194
00:06:20,831 --> 00:06:21,998
​​​ ​Ba-dum!​ ​​

195
00:06:21,998 --> 00:06:23,867
​​​ ​Proverbs!​ ​​

196
00:06:23,867 --> 00:06:25,769
​​​ ​Proverbs!​ ​​

197
00:06:24,534 --> 00:06:25,769
​​​ ​Proverbs!​ ​​

198
00:06:26,436 --> 00:06:29,306
​​​ ​Watame-sensei, can you explain​ ​​
​​ ​what proverbs are?​ ​​

199
00:06:27,003 --> 00:06:28,405
​​​ ​Wait.​ ​​

200
00:06:28,405 --> 00:06:29,306
​​​ ​I...​ ​​

201
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:31,408
​​​ ​I was just going​ ​​
​​ ​to ask you that, Botan-chan!​ ​​

202
00:06:31,408 --> 00:06:33,477
​​​ ​It's being a <i>​pro </i>​with <i>verbs.​ ​</i>​

203
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:34,177
​​​ ​Quite.​ ​​

204
00:06:34,678 --> 00:06:36,780
​​​ ​A <i>​pro </i>​with <i>verbs.​ ​</i>​

205
00:06:35,045 --> 00:06:35,746
​​​ ​Oh!​ ​​

206
00:06:36,847 --> 00:06:38,448
​​​ ​A <i>​pro </i>​with <i>​verbs</i>...​ ​​

207
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:37,914
​​​ ​Yes.​ ​​

208
00:06:38,448 --> 00:06:39,549
​​​ ​Yeah...​ ​​

209
00:06:38,782 --> 00:06:39,549
​​​ ​Verbs...​ ​​

210
00:06:39,549 --> 00:06:42,285
​​​ ​So what are they, Botan-chan?!​ ​​

211
00:06:42,285 --> 00:06:47,057
​​​ ​Proverbs are, like,​ ​​
​​ ​short lessons in the form​ ​​

212
00:06:47,057 --> 00:06:50,827
​​​ ​of single sentences​ ​​
​​ ​passed down from long ago.​ ​​

213
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,330
​​​ ​Now that's teachin'.​ ​​

214
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,330
​​​ ​That's what I'd say.​ ​​

215
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:57,567
​​​ ​By the way, the script we've got​ ​​
​​ ​for this part is pretty threadbare.​ ​​

216
00:06:57,567 --> 00:07:02,806
​​​ ​Neither Watame nor I have any idea​ ​​
​​ ​which proverbs we'll be teaching you today.​ ​​

217
00:07:02,806 --> 00:07:04,975
​​​ ​Well, we know they're related to Japan.​ ​​

218
00:07:04,975 --> 00:07:09,112
​​​ ​Both of us teachers​ ​​
​​ ​are very knowledgeable.​ ​​

219
00:07:08,745 --> 00:07:09,546
​​​ ​Indeed.​ ​​

220
00:07:09,112 --> 00:07:10,881
​​​ ​You'll be in good hands with us,​ ​​

221
00:07:10,881 --> 00:07:12,883
​​​ ​s-so please come along with us.​ ​​

222
00:07:12,883 --> 00:07:14,418
​​​ ​Please join us.​ ​​

223
00:07:14,418 --> 00:07:16,987
​​​ ​I'm in!​ ​​

224
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:16,787
​​​ ​Okay!​ ​​

225
00:07:16,987 --> 00:07:19,990
​​​ ​Question 1​ ​​

226
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:23,393
​​​ ​Here's one of the proverbs​ ​​
​​ ​we'll be teaching you!​ ​​

227
00:07:23,393 --> 00:07:24,795
​​​ ​Ba-dum!​ ​​

228
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,728
​​​ ​Ba-dum!​ ​​

229
00:07:25,061 --> 00:07:28,932
​​​ ​"Do thy laundry whilst the demon is away."​ ​​

230
00:07:28,932 --> 00:07:30,333
​​​ ​Have you heard this one?​ ​​

231
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:37,174
​​​ ​Don't go to the laundromat at night​ ​​
​​ ​or a demon will show up, right?​ ​​

232
00:07:37,174 --> 00:07:39,476
​​​ ​That may not be entirely correct.​ ​​

233
00:07:39,476 --> 00:07:43,046
​​​ ​Then, Japanese people, what does it mean?​ ​​
​​ ​What does it mean?!​ ​​

234
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:45,282
​​​ ​Please explain in detail.​ ​​

235
00:07:45,282 --> 00:07:46,583
​​​ ​The demon is...​ ​​

236
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:47,417
​​​ ​Your wife?​ ​​

237
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:49,252
​​​ ​While your wife is away...​ ​​

238
00:07:50,353 --> 00:07:53,490
​​​ ​Maybe this...​ ​​
​​ ​Maybe it's something to do with husbands?​ ​​

239
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:54,591
​​​ ​Am I wrong?​ ​​

240
00:07:54,591 --> 00:07:55,425
​​​ ​Is that wrong?​ ​​

241
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,092
​​​ ​Husbands?!​ ​​

242
00:07:55,425 --> 00:07:56,092
​​​ ​Husbands?​ ​​

243
00:07:56,293 --> 00:07:58,562
​​​ ​That can't be it!​ ​​

244
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:02,666
​​​ ​We're the students here,​ ​​
​​ ​so teachers, please teach us.​ ​​

245
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:06,002
​​​ ​Please teach us!​ ​​

246
00:08:04,267 --> 00:08:06,002
​​​ ​Tell 'em, Watame.​ ​​

247
00:08:06,002 --> 00:08:08,338
​​​ ​I don't know!​ ​​

248
00:08:08,338 --> 00:08:10,574
​​​ ​Tell us, Botan-sensei!​ ​​

249
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:12,242
​​​ ​Botan-sensei!​ ​​

250
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:13,243
​​​ ​This, well...​ ​​

251
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:17,581
​​​ ​The demon here means​ ​​
​​ ​"the person who intimidates you."​ ​​

252
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:21,785
​​​ ​"When the person who scares you​ ​​
​​ ​isn't around, you're able to relax."​ ​​

253
00:08:21,785 --> 00:08:24,721
​​​ ​I'm pretty sure that's​ ​​
​​ ​what this proverb means.​ ​​

254
00:08:24,721 --> 00:08:26,389
​​​ ​Yeah, that!​ ​​

255
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:27,691
​​​ ​That!​ ​​

256
00:08:27,691 --> 00:08:30,160
​​​ ​We seem to have an answer written here.​ ​​

257
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:30,160
​​​ ​We do?​ ​​

258
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,828
​​​ ​Let's take a look.​ ​​

259
00:08:31,828 --> 00:08:32,362
​​​ ​Ba-dum!​ ​​

260
00:08:32,362 --> 00:08:33,463
​​​ ​Ding!​ ​​

261
00:08:33,463 --> 00:08:36,466
​​​ ​When a scary person,​ ​​
​​ ​such as your boss, a senpai,​ ​​

262
00:08:36,466 --> 00:08:39,302
​​​ ​or a person you are hesitant around is gone,​ ​​

263
00:08:39,302 --> 00:08:41,705
​​​ ​you can relax and take a breather.​ ​​

264
00:08:41,705 --> 00:08:44,074
​​​ ​It's not literally about doing laundry,​ ​​

265
00:08:44,074 --> 00:08:49,145
​​​ ​but a metaphor about washing​ ​​
​​ ​your mind clean and refreshing yourself.​ ​​

266
00:08:49,145 --> 00:08:52,716
​​​ ​Botan-sensei​ ​​
​​ ​Correct​ ​​

267
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,716
​​​ ​Gotcha!​ ​​

268
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,716
​​​ ​I see!​ ​​

269
00:08:52,716 --> 00:08:54,251
​​​ ​Wow!​ ​​

270
00:08:54,251 --> 00:08:58,922
​​​ ​Do you have a "demon" in your case, Iofi?​ ​​

271
00:08:58,922 --> 00:09:00,891
​​​ ​A demon-like person?​ ​​

272
00:09:00,891 --> 00:09:05,262
​​​ ​I wouldn't quite say she's a demon, but...​ ​​

273
00:09:05,262 --> 00:09:08,198
​​​ ​I suppose I'd say my manager.​ ​​

274
00:09:08,198 --> 00:09:08,899
​​​ ​What?!​ ​​

275
00:09:09,766 --> 00:09:12,269
​​​ ​"Please be nice to her, manager."​ ​​
​​ ​—by Watame-sensei​ ​​

276
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:15,272
​​​ ​Question 2​ ​​

277
00:09:15,272 --> 00:09:18,041
​​​ ​Here's the next proverb!​ ​​

278
00:09:18,441 --> 00:09:19,209
​​​ ​What is this?​ ​​

279
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:20,544
​​​ ​Hm? What is this?​ ​​

280
00:09:20,544 --> 00:09:22,779
​​​ ​Hey, wait a sec.​ ​​

281
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:22,779
​​​ ​What?​ ​​

282
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:25,815
​​​ ​To cleave a chicken... do what?​ ​​

283
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:26,683
​​​ ​What is this?​ ​​

284
00:09:26,683 --> 00:09:31,154
​​​ ​To cleave a chicken doth not​ ​​
​​ ​demand a butcher's knife.​ ​​

285
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,522
​​​ ​Do you get it, Iofi?​ ​​

286
00:09:32,522 --> 00:09:33,857
​​​ ​No clue.​ ​​

287
00:09:33,857 --> 00:09:36,426
​​​ ​No clue here, either.​ ​​

288
00:09:36,426 --> 00:09:37,961
​​​ ​Do...​ ​​

289
00:09:37,961 --> 00:09:41,131
​​​ ​you have something you want​ ​​
​​ ​to say to me, management?​ ​​

290
00:09:41,131 --> 00:09:44,167
​​​ ​Takanashi Kiara profile:​ ​​
​​ ​A phoenix, NOT a chicken or turkey (very important)​ ​​

291
00:09:41,932 --> 00:09:44,167
​​​ ​I can sense that.​ ​​

292
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,970
​​​ ​I'm not a chicken! I'm a phoenix!​ ​​

293
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:48,872
​​​ ​They're similar, but they're different!​ ​​

294
00:09:48,872 --> 00:09:50,707
​​​ ​Should we cleave you and find out?​ ​​

295
00:09:50,707 --> 00:09:53,376
​​​ ​What is this, a horror game?!​ ​​

296
00:09:53,376 --> 00:09:55,145
​​​ ​Butcher's knife?​ ​​

297
00:09:55,145 --> 00:09:58,782
​​​ ​One of those big ones​ ​​
​​ ​they use to slice up cows.​ ​​

298
00:09:55,211 --> 00:09:58,782
​​​ ​Butcher's knife:​ ​​
​​ ​A large knife used to cut beef and such.​ ​​

299
00:09:58,782 --> 00:10:01,418
​​​ ​So it means using that to cut a chicken...​ ​​

300
00:10:01,418 --> 00:10:02,719
​​​ ​Not me! They don't mean me!​ ​​

301
00:10:02,719 --> 00:10:06,189
​​​ ​To cleave Kiara doth not​ ​​
​​ ​demand a butcher's knife.​ ​​

302
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:13,763
​​​ ​Does it mean that using a butcher knife to cut​ ​​
​​ ​a chicken is doing more than you need to?​ ​​

303
00:10:13,763 --> 00:10:14,998
​​​ ​Oh!​ ​​

304
00:10:13,763 --> 00:10:15,765
​​​ ​Oh! I get it!​ ​​

305
00:10:14,998 --> 00:10:17,100
​​​ ​Yeah, could be!​ ​​

306
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:25,642
​​​ ​Ya don't need to grab somethin' so big​ ​​
​​ ​to take care'a somethin' so tiny!​ ​​

307
00:10:24,975 --> 00:10:27,677
​​​ ​Yeah! You bet!​ ​​

308
00:10:27,677 --> 00:10:29,879
​​​ ​Let's see the answer!​ ​​

309
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:38,254
​​​ ​Meaning: You don't need to use​ ​​
​​ ​extreme methods to deal with a small thing.​ ​​

310
00:10:31,081 --> 00:10:32,949
​​​ ​Nice!​ ​​

311
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,217
​​​ ​Watame-sensei was correct!​ ​​

312
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:36,486
​​​ ​Yay!​ ​​

313
00:10:36,486 --> 00:10:37,954
​​​ ​Kiara-chan, you were right, too!​ ​​

314
00:10:37,954 --> 00:10:40,557
​​​ ​All right!​ ​​

315
00:10:38,488 --> 00:10:40,557
​​​ ​Kiara-sensei!​ ​​

316
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:43,927
​​​ ​Looking at this,​ ​​
​​ ​it's pretty much a literal meaning.​ ​​

317
00:10:43,927 --> 00:10:45,629
​​​ ​Yeah, surprisingly.​ ​​

318
00:10:45,629 --> 00:10:50,667
​​​ ​There are quite a few proverbs​ ​​
​​ ​you can take literally.​ ​​

319
00:10:48,965 --> 00:10:50,667
​​​ ​Yeah, true!​ ​​

320
00:10:51,534 --> 00:10:54,437
