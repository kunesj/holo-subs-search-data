8251
04:21:03,300 --> 04:21:07,969
kill a few bats and
they throw money at you

8252
04:21:07,969 --> 04:21:07,979

 

8253
04:21:07,979 --> 04:21:15,769

okay I would like to open that please

8254
04:21:15,769 --> 04:21:15,779

 

8255
04:21:15,779 --> 04:21:20,269

but so yeah yeah number two see what

8256
04:21:20,269 --> 04:21:20,279
but so yeah yeah number two see what
 

8257
04:21:20,279 --> 04:21:22,429
but so yeah yeah number two see what
that one goes right next to the red one

8258
04:21:22,429 --> 04:21:22,439
that one goes right next to the red one
 

8259
04:21:22,439 --> 04:21:24,590
that one goes right next to the red one
so I wonder if the first one is really

8260
04:21:24,590 --> 04:21:24,600
so I wonder if the first one is really
 

8261
04:21:24,600 --> 04:21:26,990
so I wonder if the first one is really
like the the one that's hanging on the

8262
04:21:26,990 --> 04:21:27,000
like the the one that's hanging on the
 

8263
04:21:27,000 --> 04:21:28,309
like the the one that's hanging on the
ceiling

8264
04:21:28,309 --> 04:21:28,319
ceiling
 

8265
04:21:28,319 --> 04:21:31,910
ceiling
because that would be positioned

8266
04:21:31,910 --> 04:21:31,920
because that would be positioned
 

8267
04:21:31,920 --> 04:21:34,849
because that would be positioned
even earlier than

8268
04:21:34,849 --> 04:21:34,859
even earlier than
 

8269
04:21:34,859 --> 04:21:38,210
even earlier than
the table but maybe that has nothing to

8270
04:21:38,210 --> 04:21:38,220
the table but maybe that has nothing to
 

8271
04:21:38,220 --> 04:21:41,990
the table but maybe that has nothing to
do with that

8272
04:21:41,990 --> 04:21:42,000

 

8273
04:21:42,000 --> 04:21:43,849

I'll figure it out

8274
04:21:43,849 --> 04:21:43,859
I'll figure it out
 

8275
04:21:43,859 --> 04:21:46,250
I'll figure it out
after

8276
04:21:46,250 --> 04:21:46,260
after
 

8277
04:21:46,260 --> 04:21:48,830
