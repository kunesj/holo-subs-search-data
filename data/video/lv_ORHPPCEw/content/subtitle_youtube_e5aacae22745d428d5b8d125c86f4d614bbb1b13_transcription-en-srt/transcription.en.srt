how this is going to track

1146
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:48,240
how this is going to track
 

1147
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,950
how this is going to track
honestly we'll see oh well you can

1148
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:50,960
honestly we'll see oh well you can

push-ups against the wall it's also
better probably for tracking okay not

1158
00:34:59,710 --> 00:34:59,720
better probably for tracking okay not
 

1159
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:03,470
better probably for tracking okay not
sure how that works well let's see first

1160
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:03,480
sure how that works well let's see first
 

1161
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,630
sure how that works well let's see first
