8072
03:50:38,450 --> 03:50:38,460
of formula so we're doing the collabo
 

8073
03:50:38,460 --> 03:50:40,429
of formula so we're doing the collabo
actually we would have done it earlier

8074
03:50:40,429 --> 03:50:40,439
actually we would have done it earlier
 

8075
03:50:40,439 --> 03:50:41,510
actually we would have done it earlier
but

8076
03:50:41,510 --> 03:50:41,520
but
 

8077
03:50:41,520 --> 03:50:43,610
but
um as you may know she's on like a

8078
03:50:43,610 --> 03:50:43,620
