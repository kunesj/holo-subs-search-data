pay the closest one.  I

817
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:15,549

think I'll add that amount to a certain amount of 0 and pay 20 euros.If it's 24 colors out of 18, then it's

close to that amount.If you

00:30:21,769 --> 00:30:21,779
close to that amount.If you
 

823
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:24,649
close to that amount.If you
think that's fine, then go somewhere else and

824
00:30:24,649 --> 00:30:24,659
think that's fine, then go somewhere else and
 

825
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:27,769
think that's fine, then go somewhere else and
give it to the cashier when you make a purchase.  You do

826
00:30:27,769 --> 00:30:30,110
give it to the cashier when you make a purchase.  You do

n't need to tip the cashier at that supermarket or a clothing store, but
 

834
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:49,190
n't need to tip the cashier at that supermarket or a clothing store, but
at a restaurant, it's better to tip.  It would be

Because of the keyboard, I can't write this character,

Because of the keyboard, I can't write this character,
 

993
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:50,170
Because of the keyboard, I can't write this character,
so if I can't write it, I

994

so if I can't write it, I
 

995
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:52,930
so if I can't write it, I
write it. That's how I get the message across.  The

1038
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:48,670

I hold it in the shape of my mouth and whistle.  It's difficult, is

00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:57,069

 

1040
00:37:57,069 --> 00:37:57,079

00:37:57,079 --> 00:38:06,910

n't it? This is used

1042
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:06,920

 

1043
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:12,050

in German to say goodbye and good-bye,
 

1045
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,930
in German to say goodbye and good-bye,
so the

1055
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:40,690

It's normally SS.  So, for example,

1056
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:40,700
It's normally SS.  So, for example,
 

1057
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:45,050
It's normally SS.  So, for example,
what kind of word does it appear in? It

what kind of word does it appear in? It
 

1059
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:47,390
what kind of word does it appear in? It
goes something like this. This

00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:47,400
goes something like this. This
 

1061
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:53,690
goes something like this. This
is nonsense. Now, it's the swastika. It

please give me a ride to the venue of the event, etc. I was like that too, so there are many times when I'm not there during the event, but, but, but, when something goes wrong and I need help, it's like that.  I
