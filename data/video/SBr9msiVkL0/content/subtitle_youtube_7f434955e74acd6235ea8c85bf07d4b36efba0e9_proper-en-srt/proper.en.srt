1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:01,251
​​​ ​Do I have to do that?​ ​​

2
00:00:01,251 --> 00:00:02,052
​​​ ​I'm, I'm not...​ ​​

3
00:00:02,052 --> 00:00:03,220
​​​ ​Uh, I don't quite under...​ ​​

4
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:03,921
​​​ ​No?​ ​​

5
00:00:03,921 --> 00:00:05,622
​​​ ​It should recognize it?​ ​​

6
00:00:05,622 --> 00:00:07,725
​​​ ​Uh, I think I have one more controller.​ ​​

7
00:00:07,725 --> 00:00:08,659
​​​ ​One second.​ ​​

8
00:00:16,533 --> 00:00:17,501
​​​ ​Ahh!​ ​​

9
00:00:18,102 --> 00:00:19,003
​​​ ​Argh!​ ​​

10
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:36,387
​​​ ​That really hurt.​ ​​

11
00:00:36,387 --> 00:00:38,489
​​​ ​I'm trying to find the second controller right now.​ ​​

12
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:39,656
​​​ ​One second.​ ​​

13
00:00:39,656 --> 00:00:41,158
​​​ ​I found it!​ ​​

14
00:00:41,158 --> 00:00:42,059
​​​ ​It's uh...​ ​​

15
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:44,695
​​​ ​It's a PlayStation controller.​ ​​

16
00:00:44,695 --> 00:00:45,996
​​​ ​Does that work?​ ​​
