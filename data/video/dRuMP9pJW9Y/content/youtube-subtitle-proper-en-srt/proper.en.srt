​​​ ​I'm not your mom. I'm your teacher.​ ​​

00:00:13,864 --> 00:00:17,968
​​​ ​Before we start, kids, go ahead​ ​​
​​ ​and introduce yourselves!​ ​​

00:00:29,113 --> 00:00:30,948
​​​ ​Cute.​ ​​

15
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:35,352
​​​ ​so please give me a flower stamp then.​ ​​

16

​​​ ​If you did well enough.​ ​​
​​ ​You need to earn it.​ ​​

17

​​​ ​Oh, right.​ ​​

18
00:00:38,856 --> 00:00:41,859
​​​ ​Okay. I'm Iopi, by the way. Hello.​ ​​

​​ ​but I weally am. Gonna draw lots.​ ​​

22
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,169
​​​ ​Can't wait to get started!​ ​​

23
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:52,169
​​​ ​Good to hear!​ ​​

24
00:00:53,871 --> 00:00:56,673

​​​ ​(She's introducing herself)​ ​​

26
00:01:00,778 --> 00:01:04,281
​​​ ​Seems like she can't, so I guess we'll​ ​​
​​ ​record her part some other day.​ ​​

27
00:01:05,015 --> 00:01:06,984

​​​ ​Oh, Kiwawa-chan!​ ​​

31
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:17,194
​​​ ​Draw a moai sculpture!​ ​​

32
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:17,194
​​​ ​Now, I'll give you a couple of words,​ ​​

33
00:01:17,194 --> 00:01:20,364
​​​ ​and you'll draw each one​ ​​
​​ ​without looking at the picture.​ ​​

34
00:01:20,364 --> 00:01:21,999
​​​ ​Don't wanna!​ ​​

35
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:26,270
​​​ ​If you didn't get your drawing quite right,​ ​​

36
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:29,039
​​​ ​your friends have to reveal​ ​​
​​ ​an embarrassing story of yours​ ​​

37
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:33,010
​​​ ​that you've been trying to​ ​​
​​ ​keep a secret until now.​ ​​

38
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,578
​​​ ​Oh no!​ ​​

39
00:01:33,777 --> 00:01:35,446
​​​ ​Nooo!​ ​​

40
00:01:35,446 --> 00:01:37,281
​​​ ​It's part of your broader education!​ ​​

41
00:01:37,281 --> 00:01:42,219
​​​ ​Is this how you educate children in Japan?!​ ​​

42
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:41,552
​​​ ​I don't wanna become a grown-up!​ ​​

43
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,586
​​​ ​Grown-ups are scary!​ ​​

44
00:01:43,387 --> 00:01:46,123
​​​ ​Graffiti Kindergarten!​ ​​

45
00:01:46,757 --> 00:01:49,193
​​​ ​Here's the first word! Ta-da!​ ​​

46
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:50,060
​​​ ​"Panda"?​ ​​

47
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,196
​​​ ​Let's start by drawing a panda face!​ ​​

48
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:54,565
​​​ ​Sure thing.​ ​​

49
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:53,897
​​​ ​Miss!​ ​​

50
00:01:53,897 --> 00:01:55,032
​​​ ​How much time do we have?​ ​​

51
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:58,168
​​​ ​Try to get it done asap. You'll understand​ ​​
​​ ​why when you grow up.​ ​​

52
00:01:58,168 --> 00:01:59,937
​​​ ​Can we change the colors?​ ​​

53
00:01:59,937 --> 00:02:01,738
​​​ ​Sure, you can do that!​ ​​

54
00:02:01,738 --> 00:02:04,308
​​​ ​Are there any colors to change...?​ ​​
​​ ​But sure, go ahead.​ ​​

55
00:02:04,308 --> 00:02:05,976
​​​ ​You can just stick to black and white, no?​ ​​

56
00:02:05,976 --> 00:02:09,680
​​​ ​Hey! Shh! No giving out hints!​ ​​
​​ ​Understood?​ ​​

57
00:02:07,678 --> 00:02:09,680
​​​ ​Whaaat?​ ​​

58
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,748
​​​ ​What kind of idiot would do that?​ ​​

59
00:02:11,748 --> 00:02:14,017
​​​ ​This kid just said "idiot."​ ​​

60
00:02:14,017 --> 00:02:16,086
​​​ ​How is it looking? Are you done?​ ​​

61
00:02:16,086 --> 00:02:20,991
​​​ ​Let's first see what the correct answer is.​ ​​

62
00:02:21,925 --> 00:02:25,963
​​​ ​So yes, this is what a panda looks like.​ ​​

63
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:23,827
​​​ ​Cute!​ ​​

64
00:02:23,827 --> 00:02:25,963
​​​ ​What a cutie.​ ​​

65
00:02:25,963 --> 00:02:28,665
​​​ ​Let's start with Fubuki-chan's drawing.​ ​​

66
00:02:28,665 --> 00:02:29,633
​​​ ​Okay!​ ​​

67
00:02:29,633 --> 00:02:30,367
​​​ ​Show us.​ ​​

68
00:02:31,435 --> 00:02:33,303
​​​ ​Ooh, that's cute!​ ​​

69
00:02:32,636 --> 00:02:34,238
​​​ ​This is Mr. Panda.​ ​​

70
00:02:34,805 --> 00:02:37,875
​​​ ​It's cute, but... I see you didn't color it in.​ ​​

71
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:36,940
​​​ ​In he back...​ ​​

72
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:39,877
​​​ ​That's right!​ ​​

73
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:39,877
​​​ ​Oh, you didn't!​ ​​

74
00:02:39,877 --> 00:02:43,080
​​​ ​I didn't know which parts are black​ ​​
​​ ​and which are white.​ ​​

75
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,948
​​​ ​So you tried to cover up your ignorance.​ ​​

76
00:02:45,816 --> 00:02:47,885
​​​ ​Also, that neck has quite the presence.​ ​​

77
00:02:47,451 --> 00:02:48,852
​​​ ​Whoa.​ ​​

78
00:02:47,885 --> 00:02:51,355
​​​ ​It's almost human-like, even.​ ​​

79
00:02:49,887 --> 00:02:51,355
​​​ ​It's beefy.​ ​​

80
00:02:51,355 --> 00:02:53,690
​​​ ​Let's look at Iofi-chan's drawing next.​ ​​
​​ ​Here it is.​ ​​

81
00:02:54,391 --> 00:02:56,393
​​​ ​Oh, this one's pretty cute too.​ ​​

82
00:02:56,393 --> 00:02:58,228
​​​ ​Pink pandas totally exist!​ ​​

83
00:02:58,228 --> 00:03:02,166
​​​ ​Why are you all adding your own faces...?​ ​​

84
00:03:00,831 --> 00:03:03,467
​​​ ​Wow, you're right. She did it too.​ ​​

85
00:03:03,467 --> 00:03:05,235
​​​ ​Here is Reine-chan's.​ ​​

86
00:03:07,905 --> 00:03:12,943
​​​ ​This Mr. Panda is very <i>strong​ ​</i>​
​​ ​and goes to the gym every day.​ ​​

87
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,943
​​​ ​It's a bodybuilder panda!​ ​​

88
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:15,779
​​​ ​Huh? These look so similar.​ ​​

89
00:03:13,477 --> 00:03:15,045
​​<i>​ ​Muscle!​ ​</i>​

90
00:03:15,045 --> 00:03:15,779
​​<i>​ ​Yeah!​ ​</i>​

91
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:18,315
​​<i>​ ​Gym Panda! Muscle!​ ​</i>​

92
00:03:18,315 --> 00:03:21,151
​​​ ​Finally, let's look at Kiara-chan's drawing!​ ​​

93
00:03:21,151 --> 00:03:22,386
​​​ ​Please don't...​ ​​

94
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,057
​​​ ​It's a raccoon! A raccoon!​ ​​

95
00:03:25,656 --> 00:03:27,057
​​​ ​This isn't quite...​ ​​

96
00:03:27,057 --> 00:03:29,793
​​​ ​It's not a raccoon! It's a panda!​ ​​

97
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,795
​​​ ​It's the odd one out​ ​​
​​ ​compared to the others.​ ​​

98
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:34,765
​​​ ​Come on! Mine's​ ​​
​​ ​eating bamboo and everything!​ ​​

99
00:03:34,765 --> 00:03:39,536
​​​ ​And now to decide​ ​​
​​ ​which ones are wrong. Well...​ ​​

100
00:03:39,536 --> 00:03:43,607
​​​ ​One of them has ears that are​ ​​
​​ ​quite a bit too pointy for a panda,​ ​​

101
00:03:43,607 --> 00:03:45,943
​​​ ​and I'm afraid it's yours, Kiara-chan.​ ​​

102
00:03:45,943 --> 00:03:48,545
​​​ ​But I worked so hard on this!​ ​​

103
00:03:48,545 --> 00:03:53,383
​​​ ​Well, Kiara-chan, looks like it's​ ​​
​​ ​time to expose one of your secrets.​ ​​

104
00:03:54,051 --> 00:03:57,521
​​​ ​It's your own fault! It's your own fault!​ ​​

105
00:03:57,521 --> 00:04:01,992
​​​ ​So, do any of you have​ ​​
​​ ​a secret of hers to share?​ ​​

106
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:04,695
​​​ ​Me! Me! Me! Me!​ ​​

107
00:04:02,526 --> 00:04:04,695
​​​ ​Oh? Fubuki-chan!​ ​​

108
00:04:04,695 --> 00:04:10,000
​​​ ​Miss! Kiara-chan had ramen the other day,​ ​​

109
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,104
​​​ ​and it took her a whole hour to finish it!​ ​​

110
00:04:11,235 --> 00:04:12,536
​​​ ​What?!​ ​​

111
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:14,738
​​​ ​One hour?!​ ​​

112
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:14,738
​​​ ​A whole hour?!​ ​​

113
00:04:14,738 --> 00:04:16,907
​​​ ​What's wrong with that?​ ​​

114
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,474
​​​ ​That's so slow, Kiwawa!​ ​​

115
00:04:17,474 --> 00:04:18,842
​​​ ​The noodles will get soggy.​ ​​

116
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,876
​​​ ​They'll get soggy, yeah.​ ​​

117
00:04:19,876 --> 00:04:23,747
​​​ ​They also get longer, and there's nothing​ ​​
​​ ​wrong with more noodle, is there?​ ​​

118
00:04:24,581 --> 00:04:27,284
​​​ ​Why did it take you that long, I wonder?​ ​​

119
00:04:27,284 --> 00:04:31,421
​​​ ​I can't slurp up ramen noodles, so instead​ ​​

120
00:04:31,421 --> 00:04:35,025
​​​ ​I figured out a different way to enjoy them.​ ​​

121
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,025
​​​ ​A different way, I see.​ ​​

122
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:36,727
​​​ ​There's the spoon, right?​ ​​

123
00:04:36,727 --> 00:04:38,328
​​​ ​The soup spoon, yes.​ ​​

124
00:04:37,594 --> 00:04:40,864
​​​ ​I first put some noodles in,​ ​​

125
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:45,402
​​​ ​then top it with corn and green onions​ ​​
​​ ​and other trimmings.​ ​​

126
00:04:45,402 --> 00:04:49,973
​​​ ​Then I blow on it because I have​ ​​
​​ ​a sensitive tongue, and finally I eat it.​ ​​

127
00:04:48,505 --> 00:04:49,973
​​​ ​This is one long explanation.​ ​​

128
00:04:49,973 --> 00:04:54,344
​​​ ​You don't get any toppings in your mouth​ ​​
​​ ​when you slurp up the noodles, right?​ ​​

129
00:04:54,344 --> 00:04:58,749
​​​ ​But if you pile it all up on a spoon,​ ​​
​​ ​you get to enjoy everything at once.​ ​​

130
00:04:58,749 --> 00:05:01,385
​​​ ​It actually tastes better that way!​ ​​

131
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:04,021
​​​ ​W-Wouldn't you end up​ ​​
​​ ​with soggy noodles, though?​ ​​

132
00:05:04,021 --> 00:05:06,923
​​​ ​I just told you I get to​ ​​
​​ ​eat more noodles that way!​ ​​

133
00:05:07,991 --> 00:05:10,727
​​​ ​Graffiti Kindergarten!​ ​​

134
00:05:11,662 --> 00:05:13,730
​​​ ​Here's your next word!​ ​​

135
00:05:14,698 --> 00:05:17,601
​​​ ​Draw a pteranodon!​ ​​

136
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,968
​​​ ​A what now?!​ ​​

137
00:05:17,601 --> 00:05:20,137
​​<i>​ ​Let's draw a pteranodon.​ ​</i>​

138
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:20,137
​​​ ​A pteranodon?​ ​​

139
00:05:20,137 --> 00:05:21,204
​​​ ​Do you know what that is?​ ​​

140
00:05:21,204 --> 00:05:22,239
​​​ ​A pteranodon?​ ​​

141
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:26,209
​​​ ​Going from a panda straight to a​ ​​
​​ ​pteranodon is a bit much, Miss.​ ​​

142
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:30,814
​​​ ​Before we look at your drawings,​ ​​
​​ ​let's check the correct answer, okay?​ ​​

143
00:05:31,348 --> 00:05:32,783
​​​ ​You all got it, right?​ ​​

144
00:05:32,783 --> 00:05:37,621
​​​ ​I'm sure you've all seen this​ ​​
​​ ​in a game somewhere.​ ​​

145
00:05:33,317 --> 00:05:34,751
​​​ ​I got it! I got it!​ ​​

146
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:36,286
​​​ ​Me too!​ ​​

147
00:05:37,621 --> 00:05:40,057
​​​ ​Did all of you really know this?​ ​​

148
00:05:40,057 --> 00:05:43,160
​​​ ​Aren't you a bit​ ​​
​​ ​too smart for kindergartners?​ ​​

149
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,397
​​​ ​Let's reveal all your drawings in one go.​ ​​
​​ ​Here they are!​ ​​

150
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:51,401
​​​ ​What?! Why did everyone else get it right?!​ ​​

151
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:53,704
​​​ ​Oh dear, this is bad.​ ​​

152
00:05:53,704 --> 00:05:56,573
​​​ ​Kiara-chan,​ ​​
​​ ​is this an attempt at a joke, maybe?​ ​​

153
00:05:56,573 --> 00:05:58,542
​​​ ​No, it's not! I swear!​ ​​

154
00:05:58,542 --> 00:06:01,044
​​​ ​I didn't know what a <i>pterano</i>-something was,​ ​​

155
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,679
​​​ ​Oh, you didn't know.​ ​​

156
00:06:01,044 --> 00:06:04,748
​​​ ​so I drew a N*tella-don instead.​ ​​

157
00:06:04,748 --> 00:06:06,083
​​​ ​N*tella-don...?​ ​​

158
00:06:05,182 --> 00:06:08,452
​​​ ​N*tella's this delicious,​ ​​
​​ ​chocolate-like thing...​ ​​

159
00:06:06,316 --> 00:06:08,452
​​​ ​A N*tella bowl?​ ​​

160
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:10,387
​​​ ​N*tella on rice? That exists?!​ ​​

161
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:10,387
​​​ ​N*tella-don!​ ​​

162
00:06:10,387 --> 00:06:12,856
​​​ ​It doesn't, but I might try one now.​ ​​

163
00:06:13,657 --> 00:06:16,827
​​​ ​Sorry, Kiara-chan, but this doesn't count!​ ​​

164
00:06:16,827 --> 00:06:18,328
​​​ ​I mean, yeah, there's no way.​ ​​

165
00:06:18,328 --> 00:06:21,798
​​​ ​It's your own fault! It's your own fault!​ ​​

166
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:25,936
​​​ ​Does anyone else have an embarrassing​ ​​
​​ ​story about Kiara-chan?​ ​​

167
00:06:25,936 --> 00:06:29,005
​​​ ​Me! Me! Me! Meee!​ ​​

168
00:06:26,937 --> 00:06:29,005
​​​ ​Oh! Reine-chan!​ ​​

169
00:06:29,005 --> 00:06:31,775
​​​ ​There was this time Kiara-san​ ​​

170
00:06:31,775 --> 00:06:35,512
​​​ ​called over a friend for one single thing:​ ​​

171
00:06:35,512 --> 00:06:40,250
​​​ ​to turn on her computer​ ​​
​​ ​because she couldn't do it herself!​ ​​

172
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:45,522
​​​ ​I had a stream that day,​ ​​
​​ ​but my computer wouldn't boot up.​ ​​

173
00:06:45,522 --> 00:06:47,557
​​​ ​Aah, that's bad.​ ​​

174
00:06:45,522 --> 00:06:48,558
​​​ ​So I tried pressing the power button harder,​ ​​

175
00:06:48,558 --> 00:06:50,193
​​​ ​but again, nothing.​ ​​

176
00:06:50,193 --> 00:06:54,898
​​​ ​I did that for ten more minutes,​ ​​
​​ ​but it wouldn't budge!​ ​​

177
00:06:54,898 --> 00:06:57,267
​​​ ​I was like,​ ​​
​​ ​"Oh no, I have a stream coming up,​ ​​

178
00:06:57,267 --> 00:06:59,403
​​​ ​and my PC is broken!"​ ​​

179
00:06:58,101 --> 00:06:59,403
​​​ ​Oh no!​ ​​

180
00:06:59,403 --> 00:07:03,473
​​​ ​So I ended up calling a friend​ ​​
​​ ​who knows stuff about computers.​ ​​

181
00:07:03,473 --> 00:07:06,042
​​​ ​They said​ ​​
​​ ​"All right, let me see what happens,"​ ​​

182
00:07:06,042 --> 00:07:09,713
​​​ ​and pressed the button,​ ​​
​​ ​and the PC turned on just like that.​ ​​

183
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,047
​​​ ​What?​ ​​

184
00:07:11,948 --> 00:07:14,050
​​​ ​Have some sympathy, will you?​ ​​

185
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:16,553
​​​ ​I'll be spilling <i>your </i>tea in the next rounds!​ ​​

186
00:07:16,553 --> 00:07:19,322
​​​ ​Graffiti Kindergarten!​ ​​

187
00:07:19,923 --> 00:07:21,558
​​​ ​Here is the next word.​ ​​

188
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:24,961
​​​ ​Draw a bulldozer!​ ​​

189
00:07:25,429 --> 00:07:27,030
​​​ ​A bulldozer?​ ​​

190
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,032
​​​ ​I don't remember what the front looks like.​ ​​

191
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:30,333
​​​ ​Can you draw it?​ ​​

192
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,436
​​​ ​Of course we can!​ ​​

193
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,436
​​​ ​Bulldozer!​ ​​

194
00:07:32,436 --> 00:07:34,871
​​​ ​Can we leave out the color?​ ​​

195
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,339
​​​ ​Color it!​ ​​

196
00:07:36,673 --> 00:07:37,808
​​​ ​Fiiine.​ ​​

197
00:07:37,808 --> 00:07:40,844
​​​ ​Let's first check the correct answer!​ ​​
​​ ​Here it is.​ ​​

198
00:07:41,745 --> 00:07:45,081
​​​ ​All right, this is what a bulldozer looks like.​ ​​

199
00:07:46,249 --> 00:07:47,851
​​​ ​Cool.​ ​​

200
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:48,785
​​​ ​Beeg!​ ​​

201
00:07:47,017 --> 00:07:48,785
​​​ ​Yellow!​ ​​

202
00:07:48,785 --> 00:07:53,123
​​​ ​Now let's see what you made of it.​ ​​

203
00:07:53,523 --> 00:07:58,495
​​​ ​What's this? One of these has a rather​ ​​
​​ ​round thing in front of it.​ ​​

204
00:07:58,495 --> 00:08:01,231
​​​ ​More specifically Reine-chan's.​ ​​

205
00:08:02,165 --> 00:08:04,801
​​​ ​It's the Road Roller!​ ​​

206
00:08:05,435 --> 00:08:08,305
​​​ ​That's right, it's the "WRYYY!" thing.​ ​​

207
00:08:08,305 --> 00:08:13,710
​​​ ​Looks like Reine-chan's the odd one out.​ ​​

208
00:08:10,841 --> 00:08:12,075
​​​ ​You're out!​ ​​

209
00:08:13,109 --> 00:08:16,279
​​​ ​Reine, you're out!​ ​​
​​ ​Time for a spanking!​ ​​

210
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:17,380
​​​ ​Spanking...​ ​​

211
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,050
​​​ ​That's a different show.​ ​​

212
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:24,387
​​​ ​Meanwhile, Iofi-chan's bulldozer has​ ​​
​​ ​an angry face for some reason.​ ​​

213
00:08:24,387 --> 00:08:29,292
​​​ ​I saw a movie with bulldozers once,​ ​​
​​ ​and they all had eyes, Miss.​ ​​

214
00:08:29,292 --> 00:08:31,094
​​​ ​Oh, that's why!​ ​​

215
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,897
​​​ ​But real bulldozers don't have eyes,​ ​​
​​ ​so you're also out.​ ​​

216
00:08:33,897 --> 00:08:35,765
​​​ ​Out!​ ​​

217
00:08:36,366 --> 00:08:39,836
​​​ ​It's your own fault! It's your own fault!​ ​​

218
00:08:39,836 --> 00:08:43,373
​​​ ​Let's expose a juicy secret of yours.​ ​​

219
00:08:43,373 --> 00:08:45,108
​​​ ​It's exposure time!​ ​​

220
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:49,045
​​​ ​Does anyone know an​ ​​
​​ ​embarrassing story about Iofi-chan?​ ​​

221
00:08:49,045 --> 00:08:52,082
​​​ ​I've got one! <i>Yes!​ ​</i>​

222
00:08:50,847 --> 00:08:53,717
​​​ ​Oh, so you do!​ ​​

223
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:57,254
​​​ ​Then please share it with the class.​ ​​

224
00:08:56,186 --> 00:08:57,254
​​​ ​Nooo!​ ​​

225
00:08:57,254 --> 00:09:02,859
​​​ ​There was this time​ ​​
​​ ​during one of her streams​ ​​

226
00:09:02,859 --> 00:09:07,597
​​​ ​when she referred to​ ​​
​​ ​a ring as a <i>cincin </i>(PP)!​ ​​

227
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,865
​​​ ​Disqualified!​ ​​

228
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:07,597
​​​ ​What?!​ ​​

229
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:10,934
​​​ ​"Peepee"?!​ ​​

230
00:09:10,934 --> 00:09:16,206
​​​ ​That's just what we call​ ​​
​​ ​rings in Indonesian. "Cincin."​ ​​

231
00:09:13,937 --> 00:09:16,206
​​​ ​Yep! That's the word we use!​ ​​

232
00:09:16,206 --> 00:09:20,143
​​​ ​The most embarrassing instance​ ​​
​​ ​of this was when I was in Japan.​ ​​

233
00:09:19,075 --> 00:09:20,143
​​​ ​When you went to Japan?​ ​​

234
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:23,680
​​​ ​You've got those anime merch stores, right?​ ​​

235
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,415
​​​ ​I was looking around in one,​ ​​

236
00:09:25,415 --> 00:09:29,886
​​​ ​and I said "Oh, they have rings​ ​​
​​ ​as merch" in Indonesian,​ ​​

237
00:09:29,886 --> 00:09:31,922
​​​ ​but it sounded like​ ​​
​​ ​"Oh, they have peepee merch."​ ​​

238
00:09:31,922 --> 00:09:34,224
​​​ ​The other people in the store​ ​​

239
00:09:34,224 --> 00:09:36,860
​​​ ​gave me some weird looks after that.​ ​​

240
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,096
​​​ ​I see... But it's just a ring, right?​ ​​

241
00:09:40,096 --> 00:09:40,897
​​​ ​Yeah...​ ​​

242
00:09:40,897 --> 00:09:42,699
​​​ ​If that's the case,​ ​​

243
00:09:42,699 --> 00:09:47,404
​​​ ​I can say that Mio gave me​ ​​
​​ ​a <i>cincin </i>last year.​ ​​

244
00:09:47,404 --> 00:09:51,274
​​​ ​This is going on the official channel,​ ​​
​​ ​so I think it's time to stop.​ ​​

245
00:09:51,274 --> 00:09:51,908
​​<i>​ ​Cincin.​ ​</i>​

246
00:09:52,909 --> 00:09:54,844
​​​ ​One moment please​ ​​

247
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:59,583
​​​ ​So, does anyone know an​ ​​
​​ ​embarrassing story about Reine-san?​ ​​

248
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,718
​​​ ​I do! I do! I do!​ ​​

249
00:10:03,453 --> 00:10:08,091
​​​ ​This was when we were​ ​​
​​ ​staying in the Maldives.​ ​​

250
00:10:08,091 --> 00:10:09,859
​​​ ​I woke up in the night​ ​​

251
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:13,163
​​​ ​because she was touching me all over!​ ​​

252
00:10:11,461 --> 00:10:13,163
​​​ ​Touching you?!​ ​​

253
00:10:13,163 --> 00:10:15,031
​​​ ​I didn't do it on purpose!​ ​​

254
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,834
​​​ ​It wasn't intentional?​ ​​

255
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,834
​​​ ​Really now?​ ​​

256
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:21,338
​​​ ​I was sleeping with my back turned to her,​ ​​

257
00:10:21,338 --> 00:10:26,376
​​​ ​when I suddenly felt​ ​​
​​ ​her fingers brush up my back.​ ​​

258
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,812
​​​ ​She was stroking your back?​ ​​

259
00:10:27,077 --> 00:10:29,312
​​​ ​Yeah! She was stroking me!​ ​​

260
00:10:28,812 --> 00:10:31,247
​​​ ​Why did you do that, Reine-chan?​ ​​

261
00:10:29,312 --> 00:10:30,714
​​​ ​I mean...​ ​​

262
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:35,251
​​​ ​I don't know! I was asleep!​ ​​

263
00:10:35,251 --> 00:10:39,155
​​​ ​But I wub her, so I didn't actually mind!​ ​​

264
00:10:39,155 --> 00:10:41,591
​​​ ​Yay!​ ​​

265
00:10:39,956 --> 00:10:41,591
​​​ ​Yaaay!​ ​​

266
00:10:39,956 --> 00:10:42,258
​​​ ​Such a sweet baby.​ ​​

267
00:10:42,258 --> 00:10:43,727
​​​ ​You can touch me more if you want.​ ​​

268
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:44,828
​​​ ​She gave you permission.​ ​​

269
00:10:44,828 --> 00:10:46,463
​​​ ​"Touch her sweet pey-pey"...​ ​​

270
00:10:48,365 --> 00:10:50,767
​​​ ​Touching her pey-pey?​ ​​
​​ ​What does that mean?​ ​​

271
00:10:50,767 --> 00:10:52,602
​​​ ​Pey-pey is p—​ ​​

272
00:10:52,602 --> 00:10:54,371
​​​ ​One moment please​ ​​

273
00:10:54,371 --> 00:10:57,474
​​​ ​Those were all the words for today,​ ​​

274
00:10:57,474 --> 00:11:02,379
​​​ ​but there's someone in the class​ ​​
​​ ​we haven't heard a story about yet...​ ​​

275
00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:06,616
​​​ ​I have something to​ ​​
​​ ​spill about Fubuki-senpai.​ ​​

276
00:11:06,616 --> 00:11:08,284
​​​ ​You do? Then please do share!​ ​​

277
00:11:08,284 --> 00:11:09,786
​​​ ​Tell us!​ ​​

278
00:11:09,786 --> 00:11:13,456
​​​ ​A long time ago, Fubuki-senpai...​ ​​

279
00:11:13,456 --> 00:11:16,626
​​​ ​cut up a wild boar.​ ​​

280
00:11:16,626 --> 00:11:19,462
​​​ ​She... cut it up?​ ​​

281
00:11:17,961 --> 00:11:19,462
​​​ ​How so?​ ​​

282
00:11:19,462 --> 00:11:23,900
​​​ ​Japanese is too hard for me,​ ​​
​​ ​so please tell them yourself.​ ​​

283
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:28,705
​​​ ​Well... Way back when I was a little kid,​ ​​

284
00:11:28,705 --> 00:11:32,342
​​​ ​my grandpa accidentally​ ​​

285
00:11:32,342 --> 00:11:35,545
​​​ ​ran over a wild boar.​ ​​

286
00:11:35,545 --> 00:11:40,016
​​​ ​Boars often roam about​ ​​
​​ ​in the sticks, you see.​ ​​

287
00:11:40,016 --> 00:11:43,319
​​​ ​Grandpa then brought the dead boar home​ ​​

288
00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:46,089
​​​ ​and turned it into meat.​ ​​

289
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:47,424
​​​ ​You ate it?​ ​​

290
00:11:47,424 --> 00:11:49,426
​​​ ​Yep! We did!​ ​​

291
00:11:49,426 --> 00:11:52,295
​​​ ​And it was delicious.​ ​​

292
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,596
​​​ ​Oh, it was?​ ​​

293
00:11:53,596 --> 00:11:56,466
​​​ ​Did you cut it up yourself?​ ​​

294
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,134
​​​ ​I just helped a little bit.​ ​​

295
00:11:57,333 --> 00:12:01,137
​​​ ​Still, that's impressive.​ ​​

296
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,772
​​​ ​It was pretty gross, though.​ ​​

297
00:12:05,775 --> 00:12:10,080
​​​ ​Well then, thank you for all your​ ​​
​​ ​fun and wacky stories.​ ​​

300

​​ ​It's for your own good.​ ​​

00:12:13,349 --> 00:12:14,317
