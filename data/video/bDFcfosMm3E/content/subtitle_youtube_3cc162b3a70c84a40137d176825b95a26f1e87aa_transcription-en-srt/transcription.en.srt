106
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:02,600
mean I I remember anything one thing I
 

107
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,590
mean I I remember anything one thing I
can definitely do is extend the time for

108
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:05,600
can definitely do is extend the time for
 

109
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,189
can definitely do is extend the time for
each turn I I think that is round time

110
00:06:08,189 --> 00:06:08,199
each turn I I think that is round time
 

111
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:10,749
each turn I I think that is round time
20 seconds so that you have more time to

00:06:10,749 --> 00:06:10,759
20 seconds so that you have more time to
 

113
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:14,029
20 seconds so that you have more time to
figure out what to do maybe maybe just

time is infinite yeah no round time is

166
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:35,639
time is infinite yeah no round time is
 

167
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:38,869
time is infinite yeah no round time is
infinite but turn time I cannot do

168
00:07:38,869 --> 00:07:38,879
infinite but turn time I cannot do
 

169
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:41,830
infinite but turn time I cannot do
infinite 90 seconds is the maximum

170
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:41,840
infinite 90 seconds is the maximum
 

171
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,710

Ladies sorry okay and warm heal yeah t
 

173
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,550
Ladies sorry okay and warm heal yeah t
so real time infinite means no sudden

174
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:48,560
so real time infinite means no sudden
 

175
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,469
so real time infinite means no sudden
death or what no just that yeah I guess

176
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:52,479
death or what no just that yeah I guess
 

177
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,390
death or what no just that yeah I guess
so I guess so that would probably mean

178
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:54,400
so I guess so that would probably mean
 

179
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,189
so I guess so that would probably mean
that yeah what's going on wait a minute

180
00:07:57,189 --> 00:07:57,199
that yeah what's going on wait a minute
 

181
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,070
that yeah what's going on wait a minute
I was just trying to figure out what

182
00:07:59,070 --> 00:07:59,080
I was just trying to figure out what
 

183
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,390
I was just trying to figure out what
things

184
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:00,400
things
 

185
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,950
things
spontaneous

186
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:02,960
spontaneous
 

187
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,309
spontaneous
combustion let's go you figure it out

188
00:08:07,309 --> 00:08:07,319
combustion let's go you figure it out
 

189
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:09,869
combustion let's go you figure it out
um we want we want sudden death of

190
00:08:09,869 --> 00:08:09,879
um we want we want sudden death of
 

191
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:14,469
um we want we want sudden death of
course we want it so 20 or what yeah I'm

192
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:14,479
course we want it so 20 or what yeah I'm
 

193
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:17,230
course we want it so 20 or what yeah I'm
I'm bringing it down to like yeah 20

194
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:17,240
I'm bringing it down to like yeah 20
 

195
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,710
I'm bringing it down to like yeah 20
probably all right all

196
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:18,720
probably all right all
 

197
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,029
probably all right all
right um okay so just to get you a

198
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:23,039
right um okay so just to get you a
 

199
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,350
right um okay so just to get you a
general idea we all have worms on this

200
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:25,360
general idea we all have worms on this
 

201
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,350
general idea we all have worms on this
field it's one screen we're all seeing

202
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:28,360
field it's one screen we're all seeing
 

203
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,070
field it's one screen we're all seeing
roughly the same thing

204
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,080
roughly the same thing
 

205
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,149
roughly the same thing
and then you can choose in your turn you

206
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:32,159
and then you can choose in your turn you
 

207
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,190
and then you can choose in your turn you
can choose a weapon I think you can also

208
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:34,200
can choose a weapon I think you can also
 

209
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,589
can choose a weapon I think you can also
switch the worm that you have selected

210
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:37,599
switch the worm that you have selected
 

211
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,750
switch the worm that you have selected
but I don't remember how but it

212
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:39,760
but I don't remember how but it
 

213
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,750
but I don't remember how but it
automatically selects one worm and then

214
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:41,760
automatically selects one worm and then
 

215
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,030
automatically selects one worm and then
you can like get a weapon and then shoot

216
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,040
you can like get a weapon and then shoot
 

217
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,590
you can like get a weapon and then shoot
sometimes you already have a weapon

218
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:46,600
sometimes you already have a weapon
 

219
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,070
sometimes you already have a weapon
sometimes it's around you uh and you can

220
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:49,080
sometimes it's around you uh and you can
 

221
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,310
sometimes it's around you uh and you can
pick it up go there pick it up but like

222
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:51,320
pick it up go there pick it up but like
 

223
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,310
pick it up go there pick it up but like
you have I think if you start walking

224
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:55,320
you have I think if you start walking
 

225
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,710
you have I think if you start walking
and then stop walking uh I think you

226
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:58,720
and then stop walking uh I think you
 

227
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,750
and then stop walking uh I think you
can't continue walking uh eventually

228
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:03,760
can't continue walking uh eventually
 

229
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,790
can't continue walking uh eventually
like there's a limited uh distance that

230
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:05,800
like there's a limited uh distance that
 

231
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,030
like there's a limited uh distance that
you can

232
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:07,040
you can
 

233
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:14,269
you can
walk and like D and D yeah uh you'll see

234
00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:14,279
walk and like D and D yeah uh you'll see
 

235
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:16,430
walk and like D and D yeah uh you'll see
and and yeah but you pick up a weapon

236
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:16,440
and and yeah but you pick up a weapon
 

237
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,990
and and yeah but you pick up a weapon
and then you aim for someone you want to

238
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:18,000
and then you aim for someone you want to
 

239
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,550
and then you aim for someone you want to
take out all the other teams and

240
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:20,560
take out all the other teams and
 

241
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,069
take out all the other teams and
eventually the terrain will be destroyed

242
00:09:23,069 --> 00:09:23,079
eventually the terrain will be destroyed
 

243
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:25,470
eventually the terrain will be destroyed
too and there's a chance that you'll

244
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:25,480
too and there's a chance that you'll
 

245
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,509
too and there's a chance that you'll
self-destruct because you're destroying

246
00:09:28,509 --> 00:09:28,519
self-destruct because you're destroying
 

247
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:30,949
self-destruct because you're destroying
the Earth that you're standing on for

248
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:30,959
the Earth that you're standing on for
 

249
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:35,550
the Earth that you're standing on for
example yeah you'll see and there's

250
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:35,560
example yeah you'll see and there's
 

251
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:39,190
example yeah you'll see and there's
really really op weapons here and there

252
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:39,200
really really op weapons here and there
 

253
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,069
really really op weapons here and there
so let's try to find let's just do it

254
00:09:42,069 --> 00:09:42,079
so let's try to find let's just do it
 

255
00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:43,870
so let's try to find let's just do it
cuz none nothing of what you said made

256
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:43,880
cuz none nothing of what you said made
 

257
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,710
cuz none nothing of what you said made
any sense yeah I guess so okay we'll do

258
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:46,720
any sense yeah I guess so okay we'll do
 

259
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,990
any sense yeah I guess so okay we'll do
it as we go press ready uh yeah okay

260
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:51,000
it as we go press ready uh yeah okay
 

261
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,910
it as we go press ready uh yeah okay
maybe it's one of those games Nissa

262
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:52,920
maybe it's one of those games Nissa
 

263
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,030
maybe it's one of those games Nissa
where you don't have to know what's

264
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:54,040
where you don't have to know what's

hope yeah no not necessarily
 

269
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,470
hope yeah no not necessarily
no but the first round learning learning
