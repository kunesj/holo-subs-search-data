00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:03,354
​​​ ​"Watame-chan is so cute, isn't she?"​ ​​

2
00:00:03,354 --> 00:00:05,155
​​​ ​"Yeah, and she's​ ​​
​​ ​so good at singing, too."​ ​​

3
00:00:05,155 --> 00:00:06,857
​​​ ​"Almost makes you jealous, right?"​ ​​

4
00:00:06,857 --> 00:00:09,259
​​​ ​"Not to mention she smells nice,​ ​​

5
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:12,262
​​​ ​and she's soft and fluffy."​ ​​

6
00:00:12,796 --> 00:00:15,833
​​​ ​"Got to respect the sheep."​ ​​

7
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:16,333

11
00:00:21,205 --> 00:00:22,039
​​​ ​"Get it?"​ ​​

12
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:23,040
​​​ ​"We should invite her."​ ​​

13
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,342
​​​ ​"Actually, I'm challenging​ ​​
​​ ​you to a rap battle."​ ​​

14
00:00:25,342 --> 00:00:27,111
​​​ ​"Gonna lay some fire bars on you."​ ​​

15
00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:27,911
​​​ ​"Or are you too chicken?"​ ​​

16
00:00:28,212 --> 00:00:28,645
​​​ ​Hm?​ ​​

17
00:00:28,645 --> 00:00:29,446
​​​ ​Ah...​ ​​

18
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:30,514
​​​ ​Uh-oh.​ ​​

19
00:00:30,514 --> 00:00:32,016
​​​ ​R-Run awaaay!​ ​​

20
00:00:32,716 --> 00:00:35,386
​​​ ​Watame did borderline​ ​​
​​ ​nothing wrong!​ ​​
