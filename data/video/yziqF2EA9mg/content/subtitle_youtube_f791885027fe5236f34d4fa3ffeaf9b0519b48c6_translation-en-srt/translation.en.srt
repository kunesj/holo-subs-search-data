every time I do it, I cry until my T-shirt is all messed up. It

340

every time I do it, I cry until my T-shirt is all messed up. It

but at the very end there

686
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:00,960
but at the very end there
 

687
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,070

to start playing Arise because a new bundle version that combines the main game and DLC is coming out with Delsea called Beyond the Dawn.

704
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,669
to start playing Arise because a new bundle version that combines the main game and DLC is coming out with Delsea called Beyond the Dawn.
 

705
00:22:28,669 --> 00:22:28,679

 

706
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:31,970

Um, at this timing, I'm

707
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:31,980
Um, at this timing, I'm
 

708
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,250
Um, at this timing, I'm
also

709
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:34,260
also
 

710
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:37,870
also
going to touch on the new bundle version.  So yeah, yeah, it's

711
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:40,370
going to touch on the new bundle version.  So yeah, yeah, it's
 

712
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:40,380

 

713
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:43,070

going to take a little while until TNC comes out, but if you get the battle now, you'll be able to

714
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:43,080
going to take a little while until TNC comes out, but if you get the battle now, you'll be able to
 

715
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:47,210
going to take a little while until TNC comes out, but if you get the battle now, you'll be able to
play the main game right away, so

716
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:47,220
play the main game right away, so
 

717
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,810
play the main game right away, so
first of all, it's really long, so enjoy it.  I

724
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:02,570

think it's probably the best time to release it because you've already finished playing the main game.

725

the world can't be saved unless the two of us come together.

982
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:34,860

 

983
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,310

That's right, it won't

984
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:40,730

 

985
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:40,740

 

986
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:44,630

work unless these two, Shion and Alpen, stay together for the rest of their lives.  Well, I can't tell you the reason because it would be a spoiler. I'm

987
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:46,389
work unless these two, Shion and Alpen, stay together for the rest of their lives.  Well, I can't tell you the reason because it would be a spoiler. I'm
 

988
00:30:46,389 --> 00:30:46,399

 

989
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:50,710

curious, right? Sensei.

990
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:50,720

 

991
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,930

Shion-chan

992
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:52,940
Shion-chan
 

993
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:57,470
Shion-chan
is a 10 user. I guess that's right. Let's

994
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:58,970
is a 10 user. I guess that's right. Let's
 

995
00:30:58,970 --> 00:30:58,980

 

996
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:02,930

take a look at Shion-chan for a moment.

997
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:02,940

 

998
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,269

It just

999
00:31:04,269 --> 00:31:04,279
It just
 

1000
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:14,110
It just
came out, so I'm serious,

1001
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:14,120

 

1002
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,930

but besides Shion-chan, there's another woman who looks

1003
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:19,610
but besides Shion-chan, there's another woman who looks
 

1004
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:19,620

 

1005
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:23,149

like a keyword, and for

1006
00:31:23,149 --> 00:31:23,159
like a keyword, and for
 

1007
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:28,210
like a keyword, and for
a moment I could see Nekata, a woman with amazing golden hair, but

1008
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:28,220
a moment I could see Nekata, a woman with amazing golden hair, but
 

1009
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,510
a moment I could see Nekata, a woman with amazing golden hair, but
up to that point, she's the

1010
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:31,520
up to that point, she's the
 

1011
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:37,669
up to that point, she's the
heroine of Rise.  So, how

1012
00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:37,679
heroine of Rise.  So, how

1045
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:45,590

During the game, you keep defeating Shion-chan, but

1046
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:45,600
During the game, you keep defeating Shion-chan, but
 

1047

During the game, you keep defeating Shion-chan, but

1049
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,049

in reality, everyone who touches Shion-chan

1050
00:32:51,049 --> 00:32:55,130
in reality, everyone who touches Shion-chan
 

1051
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:55,140

 

1052
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:58,310

feels intense pain. First of all, if you

1053
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:58,320
feels intense pain. First of all, if you
 

1054
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,490
feels intense pain. First of all, if you
touch Shion-chan, it hurts a lot.  I

1055
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:01,500
touch Shion-chan, it hurts a lot.  I
 

1056
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,510
touch Shion-chan, it hurts a lot.  I

00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:02,520

 

1058
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,370

won't touch you. Even if I wanted to hug Shun-chan, I

1059
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:04,380
won't touch you. Even if I wanted to hug Shun-chan, I
 

1060
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:07,789
won't touch you. Even if I wanted to hug Shun-chan, I
couldn't. He's involved in a curse like that.

1061
00:33:07,789 --> 00:33:10,090
couldn't. He's involved in a curse like that.
 

1062

1063
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:16,269

Alpine has no sense of pain, so

1064
00:33:16,269 --> 00:33:16,279

 

1065
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:26,230

this would be a good match.

1066
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:26,240

 

1067
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,769

As expected, that Shion

As expected, that Shion
 

1069
00:33:29,779 --> 00:33:33,289
As expected, that Shion
is a little special.  But yeah,

1070
00:33:33,289 --> 00:33:33,299
is a little special.  But yeah,

1157
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:05,290

think we

1158
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:05,300

can do something about it.  I'm
 

1161
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,550
can do something about it.  I'm
a little concerned about this, but

1162
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:12,560
a little concerned about this, but
 

1163
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,770
a little concerned about this, but
Alpen is the only one who

1164
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:15,780
Alpen is the only one who
 

1165
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,810
Alpen is the only one who
comes into contact with Shion, right? That's

1166
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:16,820
comes into contact with Shion, right? That's
 

1167
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:19,569
comes into contact with Shion, right? That's
right.

1168

00:36:19,579 --> 00:36:24,890
right.
Shion-chan is quite like that. When I

1170
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:24,900
Shion-chan is quite like that. When I
 

1171
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,109
Shion-chan is quite like that. When I
imagine it, she seems a little lonely,

1172
00:36:27,109 --> 00:36:27,119
imagine it, she seems a little lonely,
 

1173
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,770
imagine it, she seems a little lonely,
but she's used to it, so it's pretty easy,

1174
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:30,780
but she's used to it, so it's pretty easy,
 

1175
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:34,630
but she's used to it, so it's pretty easy,
especially at first.  I feel kind of cold

1176
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:34,640
especially at first.  I feel kind of cold
 

1177
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,310
especially at first.  I feel kind of cold
about Shion-chan. She seemed a little

1178
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:37,320
about Shion-chan. She seemed a little
 

1179
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:41,870
about Shion-chan. She seemed a little
strong-willed. Oh, and

1180
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:41,880
strong-willed. Oh, and
 

1181
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,870
strong-willed. Oh, and
by the way, did you see that Shion

1182
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:44,880
by the way, did you see that Shion
 

1183
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,130
by the way, did you see that Shion
also had a gun? She wasn't

1184
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:50,230
also had a gun? She wasn't
 

1185
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:50,240

 

1186
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:54,190

'm going to clean it up.The teacher
had a lot of really cool techniques, didn't he?It was so

1791
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:54,349
had a lot of really cool techniques, didn't he?It was so
 

1792

1795
00:55:55,859 --> 00:55:57,950

easy to perform that technique that even Subaru could

1796
00:55:57,950 --> 00:55:57,960
easy to perform that technique that even Subaru could
 

1797
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:09,069
easy to perform that technique that even Subaru could
do it right away.I wonder if

1798
00:56:09,069 --> 00:56:09,079

 

1799
00:56:09,079 --> 00:56:15,849

everyone can do this with Subaru?I've seen

1800
00:56:15,849 --> 00:56:15,859

 

1801
00:56:15,859 --> 00:56:19,870

some battles in other Tales games.  There

1802
00:56:19,870 --> 00:56:19,880
some battles in other Tales games.  There
 

1803
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:23,089
some battles in other Tales games.  There
may have been some parts that I thought were difficult,

1804
00:56:23,089 --> 00:56:23,099
may have been some parts that I thought were difficult,
 

1805
00:56:23,099 --> 00:56:26,089
may have been some parts that I thought were difficult,
but Arise was really easy to remember, even though I'm no good at it,

1806

1808
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:34,910
