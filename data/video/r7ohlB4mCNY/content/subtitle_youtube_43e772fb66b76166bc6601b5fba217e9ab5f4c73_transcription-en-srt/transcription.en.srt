said can't fly so soon after surgery to
 

2573
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:33,029
said can't fly so soon after surgery to
another country if it's like a quick pop

2574
01:06:33,029 --> 01:06:33,039
another country if it's like a quick pop
 

2575
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:34,789
another country if it's like a quick pop
over to like another state or something

2576
01:06:34,789 --> 01:06:34,799
over to like another state or something
 

2577
01:06:34,799 --> 01:06:36,870
over to like another state or something
like that then then it's it's much less

2578
01:06:36,870 --> 01:06:36,880
like that then then it's it's much less
 

2579
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:41,190
like that then then it's it's much less
risky and it's fine but yeah there will

2580
01:06:41,190 --> 01:06:41,200
risky and it's fine but yeah there will
 

2581
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,710
risky and it's fine but yeah there will
still be streams it's part of who I am

your paral for us is that the word that

2660
01:08:20,349 --> 01:08:20,359
your paral for us is that the word that
 

2661
01:08:20,359 --> 01:08:23,349
your paral for us is that the word that
word has lost its meaning I feel I feel

2662
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:23,359
word has lost its meaning I feel I feel
 

2663
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:24,910
word has lost its meaning I feel I feel
like either that or it has a gazillion

2664
01:08:24,910 --> 01:08:24,920
like either that or it has a gazillion
 

2665
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:26,510
like either that or it has a gazillion
different meaning at this point it's

2666
01:08:26,510 --> 01:08:26,520
different meaning at this point it's
 

2667
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:29,149
different meaning at this point it's
kind of similar to to other buzzwords on

2668
01:08:29,149 --> 01:08:29,159
kind of similar to to other buzzwords on
 

2669
01:08:29,159 --> 01:08:32,110
kind of similar to to other buzzwords on
the internet at this point but I don't

2670
01:08:32,110 --> 01:08:32,120
the internet at this point but I don't
 

2671
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:35,269
the internet at this point but I don't
know um I need to stop being like that

2672
01:08:35,269 --> 01:08:35,279
know um I need to stop being like that
 

2673
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:37,430
know um I need to stop being like that
because sometimes it does affect like my

2674
01:08:37,430 --> 01:08:37,440
because sometimes it does affect like my
 

2675
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:39,669
because sometimes it does affect like my
sleep patterns and stuff like that I got

2676
01:08:39,669 --> 01:08:39,679
sleep patterns and stuff like that I got
 

2677
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:42,390
sleep patterns and stuff like that I got
to stop I have to

2678
01:08:42,390 --> 01:08:42,400
to stop I have to
 

2679
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:45,910
to stop I have to
stop stop it Mor that is the correct

2680
01:08:45,910 --> 01:08:45,920
stop stop it Mor that is the correct
 

2681
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:50,709
stop stop it Mor that is the correct
usage though I guess so I guess so maybe

2682
01:08:50,709 --> 01:08:50,719
usage though I guess so I guess so maybe
 

2683
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:53,990
usage though I guess so I guess so maybe
that may be but

2684
01:08:53,990 --> 01:08:54,000
that may be but
 

2685
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,910
that may be but
anyway yeah what a roller
