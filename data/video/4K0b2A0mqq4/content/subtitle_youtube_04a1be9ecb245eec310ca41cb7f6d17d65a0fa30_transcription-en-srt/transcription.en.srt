01:40:09,229 --> 01:40:09,239
I I offered an idea of
 

3711
01:40:09,239 --> 01:40:15,830
I I offered an idea of
uh maybe making a video about Phoenix's

3712
01:40:15,830 --> 01:40:15,840

 

3713
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:20,570

01:40:20,570 --> 01:40:20,580

 

3715
01:40:20,580 --> 01:40:22,970

and he said oh I like Phoenix's good

3716
01:40:22,970 --> 01:40:22,980
and he said oh I like Phoenix's good
 

3717
01:40:22,980 --> 01:40:26,570
and he said oh I like Phoenix's good
idea I don't know like if if he meant it

3718
01:40:26,570 --> 01:40:26,580
idea I don't know like if if he meant it
 

3719
01:40:26,580 --> 01:40:29,570
idea I don't know like if if he meant it
really like he was considering it but

3720
01:40:29,570 --> 01:40:29,580
really like he was considering it but
 

3721
01:40:29,580 --> 01:40:34,490
really like he was considering it but
it sounded a little bit like it

3722
01:40:34,490 --> 01:40:34,500

 

3723
01:40:34,500 --> 01:40:37,129

a little bit but maybe I mean even if if

3724
01:40:37,129 --> 01:40:37,139
a little bit but maybe I mean even if if
 

3725
01:40:37,139 --> 01:40:39,290
a little bit but maybe I mean even if if
that is under consideration I will take

3726
01:40:39,290 --> 01:40:39,300
that is under consideration I will take
 

3727
01:40:39,300 --> 01:40:43,850

yeah correct
 

4665
02:06:19,800 --> 02:06:23,689
yeah correct
kind of not that connected oh no I guess

4666
02:06:23,689 --> 02:06:23,699
kind of not that connected oh no I guess
 

4667
02:06:23,699 --> 02:06:26,030
kind of not that connected oh no I guess
no because no no because once you and

no because no no because once you and
 

4669
02:06:26,040 --> 02:06:28,189
no because no no because once you and
it's because once you annihilate them

4670
02:06:28,189 --> 02:06:28,199
it's because once you annihilate them
 

4671
02:06:28,199 --> 02:06:30,290
it's because once you annihilate them
there is nothing left

so why would I do why would anyone do
 

10021
04:29:13,199 --> 04:29:14,870
so why would I do why would anyone do
that I think it only makes sense if

10022
04:29:14,870 --> 04:29:14,880
that I think it only makes sense if
 

10023
04:29:14,880 --> 04:29:16,429
that I think it only makes sense if
you're planning on

10024
04:29:16,429 --> 04:29:16,439
you're planning on
 

10025
04:29:16,439 --> 04:29:19,490
you're planning on
like renting it out to someone

10026
04:29:19,490 --> 04:29:19,500
like renting it out to someone
 

10027
04:29:19,500 --> 04:29:21,410
like renting it out to someone
or if you live some with someone

10028
04:29:21,410 --> 04:29:21,420
or if you live some with someone
 

10029
04:29:21,420 --> 04:29:24,950
or if you live some with someone
together there and share the cost

10030
04:29:24,950 --> 04:29:24,960
together there and share the cost
 

10031
04:29:24,960 --> 04:29:27,530
together there and share the cost
but I've realized

10032
04:29:27,530 --> 04:29:27,540
but I've realized
 

10033
04:29:27,540 --> 04:29:30,290
but I've realized
with these prices

10034
04:29:30,290 --> 04:29:30,300
with these prices
 

10035
04:29:30,300 --> 04:29:32,330
with these prices
it makes no sense I would just like

10036
04:29:32,330 --> 04:29:32,340
it makes no sense I would just like
 

10037
04:29:32,340 --> 04:29:35,269
it makes no sense I would just like
waste my money

10038
04:29:35,269 --> 04:29:35,279
waste my money
 

10039
04:29:35,279 --> 04:29:39,490
waste my money
unless I want to be on the countryside

10040
04:29:39,490 --> 04:29:39,500

 

10041
04:29:39,500 --> 04:29:41,870

yeah yeah I could sell it at a later

10042
04:29:41,870 --> 04:29:41,880
yeah yeah I could sell it at a later
 

10043
04:29:41,880 --> 04:29:44,389
yeah yeah I could sell it at a later
Point sure sure but I'm looking for

10044
04:29:44,389 --> 04:29:44,399
Point sure sure but I'm looking for
 

10045
04:29:44,399 --> 04:29:45,950
Point sure sure but I'm looking for
something that I want to keep for myself

10046
04:29:45,950 --> 04:29:45,960
something that I want to keep for myself
 

10047
04:29:45,960 --> 04:29:49,309
something that I want to keep for myself
or hopefully as long as possible I mean

10048
04:29:49,309 --> 04:29:49,319
or hopefully as long as possible I mean
 

10049
04:29:49,319 --> 04:29:50,990
or hopefully as long as possible I mean
I do see the option I could oversell it

10050
04:29:50,990 --> 04:29:51,000
I do see the option I could oversell it
 

10051
04:29:51,000 --> 04:29:53,689
I do see the option I could oversell it
if I change my mind and all that but

10052
04:29:53,689 --> 04:29:53,699
if I change my mind and all that but
 

10053
04:29:53,699 --> 04:29:55,910
if I change my mind and all that but
this doesn't this didn't seem worth my

10054
04:29:55,910 --> 04:29:55,920
this doesn't this didn't seem worth my
 

10055
04:29:55,920 --> 04:29:59,090
this doesn't this didn't seem worth my
investment and and I wouldn't I wouldn't

10056
04:29:59,090 --> 04:29:59,100
investment and and I wouldn't I wouldn't
 

10057
04:29:59,100 --> 04:30:01,729
investment and and I wouldn't I wouldn't
even have the funds for that uh I would

10058
04:30:01,729 --> 04:30:01,739
even have the funds for that uh I would
 

10059
04:30:01,739 --> 04:30:04,969
even have the funds for that uh I would
have to save money for a while longer

10060
04:30:04,969 --> 04:30:04,979
have to save money for a while longer
 

10061
04:30:04,979 --> 04:30:07,250
have to save money for a while longer
so I couldn't even buy it right away if

10062
04:30:07,250 --> 04:30:07,260
so I couldn't even buy it right away if
 

10063
04:30:07,260 --> 04:30:08,689
so I couldn't even buy it right away if
I want to but that's not the normal way

10064
04:30:08,689 --> 04:30:08,699
I want to but that's not the normal way
 

10065
04:30:08,699 --> 04:30:11,689
I want to but that's not the normal way
people do it anyway apparently paying it

10066
04:30:11,689 --> 04:30:11,699
people do it anyway apparently paying it
 

10067
04:30:11,699 --> 04:30:13,429
people do it anyway apparently paying it
all up front

10068
04:30:13,429 --> 04:30:13,439
all up front
 

10069
04:30:13,439 --> 04:30:14,090
all up front
um

10070
04:30:14,090 --> 04:30:14,100
um
 

10071
04:30:14,100 --> 04:30:18,530
um
yeah yeah but so I I thought

10072
04:30:18,530 --> 04:30:18,540
yeah yeah but so I I thought
 

10073
04:30:18,540 --> 04:30:20,510
yeah yeah but so I I thought
no

10074
04:30:20,510 --> 04:30:20,520
no
 

10075
04:30:20,520 --> 04:30:24,530
no
then it would it seems more fun to

10076
04:30:24,530 --> 04:30:24,540
then it would it seems more fun to
 

10077
04:30:24,540 --> 04:30:28,729
then it would it seems more fun to
every like five years or so move to a

10078
04:30:28,729 --> 04:30:28,739
every like five years or so move to a
 

10079
04:30:28,739 --> 04:30:29,889
every like five years or so move to a
new apartment

10080
04:30:29,889 --> 04:30:29,899
new apartment
 

10081
04:30:29,899 --> 04:30:34,010
new apartment

at least when you don't own one
 

10083
04:30:34,020 --> 04:30:36,349
at least when you don't own one
then you can move around and check out

10084
04:30:36,349 --> 04:30:36,359
then you can move around and check out
 

10085
04:30:36,359 --> 04:30:38,510
then you can move around and check out
different places and you're free like

you don't have to bind yourself to
 

10089
04:30:40,080 --> 04:30:41,090
you don't have to bind yourself to
something

04:30:41,090 --> 04:30:41,100
something
 

10091
04:30:41,100 --> 04:30:44,210
something
and still I will save hundreds of

10092
04:30:44,210 --> 04:30:44,220
and still I will save hundreds of
 

10093
04:30:44,220 --> 04:30:46,610
and still I will save hundreds of
thousands of euros

10094
04:30:46,610 --> 04:30:46,620
thousands of euros
 

10095
04:30:46,620 --> 04:30:48,649
