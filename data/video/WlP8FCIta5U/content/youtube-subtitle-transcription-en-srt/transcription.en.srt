517
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,949

let me guess is it is it the capture

518
00:14:56,949 --> 00:14:56,959
let me guess is it is it the capture
 

519
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,350
let me guess is it is it the capture
card it was not the capture card but

520
00:14:59,350 --> 00:14:59,360
card it was not the capture card but
 

521
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,829
card it was not the capture card but
um it was sweet of her to assume that

00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:02,639
that was it
 

525
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,189
that was it
because it is often to capture what it

526
00:15:05,189 --> 00:15:05,199
because it is often to capture what it
 

527
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:05,910
because it is often to capture what it
used to be

piece of luggage i really hope that

2240
01:02:38,390 --> 01:02:38,400
piece of luggage i really hope that
 

2241
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:43,750
piece of luggage i really hope that
works out anyway

2242
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:43,760

 

2243
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,109

i usually take the graphics card as a

2244
01:02:45,109 --> 01:02:45,119
i usually take the graphics card as a
 

2245
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:46,309
i usually take the graphics card as a
carry-on because everything else is

2246
01:02:46,309 --> 01:02:46,319
carry-on because everything else is
 

2247
01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:48,150
carry-on because everything else is
pretty stable

2248
01:02:48,150 --> 01:02:48,160
pretty stable
 

2249
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:52,390
pretty stable

2250
01:02:52,390 --> 01:02:52,400

 

2251
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:57,750

maybe i'll do that too

2252
01:02:57,750 --> 01:02:57,760

 

2253
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:00,789

be careful with the pc heat sinks what
