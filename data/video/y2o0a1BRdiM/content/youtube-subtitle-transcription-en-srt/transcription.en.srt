01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,750
but they never managed to do it
successfully it's seems like they would

2678
01:01:56,750 --> 01:01:56,760
successfully it's seems like they would
 

2679
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:00,150
successfully it's seems like they would
open up the ceiling um and put like all

2680
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:00,160
open up the ceiling um and put like all

4215
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:27,950
together and started growing I guess it
was like half of like uh the pandemic

4216
01:38:27,950 --> 01:38:27,960
was like half of like uh the pandemic
 

4217

of a sudden people just started watching

4222
01:38:34,790 --> 01:38:34,800
of a sudden people just started watching
 

4223
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:37,310
of a sudden people just started watching
me and I think also because like I made

4224
01:38:37,310 --> 01:38:37,320
me and I think also because like I made
 

4225
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:39,270
me and I think also because like I made
friends in the community and like we all

4226
01:38:39,270 --> 01:38:39,280
friends in the community and like we all
 

4227
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:41,910
