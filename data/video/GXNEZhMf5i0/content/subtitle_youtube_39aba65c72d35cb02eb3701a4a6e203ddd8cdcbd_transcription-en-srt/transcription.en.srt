I think the best button mashing
character is probably

4296
02:02:39,709 --> 02:02:39,719

4297
02:02:39,719 --> 02:02:42,890

ayame or Elaine yeah she's a really

4298
02:02:42,890 --> 02:02:42,900
ayame or Elaine yeah she's a really
 

4299
02:02:42,900 --> 02:02:45,050
ayame or Elaine yeah she's a really
beginner friendly character like nice

4300
02:02:45,050 --> 02:02:45,060
beginner friendly character like nice
 

4301
02:02:45,060 --> 02:02:46,490
beginner friendly character like nice
close range

4302
02:02:46,490 --> 02:02:46,500
close range
 

4303
02:02:46,500 --> 02:02:48,470

02:11:22,490 --> 02:11:22,500
yeah yes but then what about the other
 

4693
02:11:22,500 --> 02:11:24,649
yeah yes but then what about the other
bar that says Max right now for me the

4694
02:11:24,649 --> 02:11:24,659
bar that says Max right now for me the
 

4695
02:11:24,659 --> 02:11:26,149
bar that says Max right now for me the
golden one

4696
02:11:26,149 --> 02:11:26,159
golden one
 

4697
02:11:26,159 --> 02:11:28,970
golden one
uh let's see there's like different ones

4698
02:11:28,970 --> 02:11:28,980
uh let's see there's like different ones
 

4699
02:11:28,980 --> 02:11:30,050
uh let's see there's like different ones
right

4700
02:11:30,050 --> 02:11:30,060
right
 

4701
02:11:30,060 --> 02:11:31,850
right
I'm pretty sure so they're like two

4702
02:11:31,850 --> 02:11:31,860
I'm pretty sure so they're like two
 

4703
02:11:31,860 --> 02:11:34,250
I'm pretty sure so they're like two
different levels of collab I believe for

4704
02:11:34,250 --> 02:11:34,260
different levels of collab I believe for
 

4705
02:11:34,260 --> 02:11:36,350
different levels of collab I believe for
example with Marian she has one where

4706
02:11:36,350 --> 02:11:36,360
example with Marian she has one where
 

4707
02:11:36,360 --> 02:11:37,910
example with Marian she has one where
she jumps out and grabs you and then she

4708
02:11:37,910 --> 02:11:37,920
she jumps out and grabs you and then she
 

4709
02:11:37,920 --> 02:11:39,410
she jumps out and grabs you and then she
has an even stronger one where her ship

4710
02:11:39,410 --> 02:11:39,420
has an even stronger one where her ship
 

4711
02:11:39,420 --> 02:11:41,149
has an even stronger one where her ship
comes out and shoots you oh that one I

4712
02:11:41,149 --> 02:11:41,159
comes out and shoots you oh that one I
 

4713
02:11:41,159 --> 02:11:44,270
comes out and shoots you oh that one I
believe I mean I believe it's that you

4714
02:11:44,270 --> 02:11:44,280
believe I mean I believe it's that you
 

4715
02:11:44,280 --> 02:11:46,010
believe I mean I believe it's that you
need to do a quarter circle plus heavier

4716
02:11:46,010 --> 02:11:46,020
need to do a quarter circle plus heavier
 

4717
02:11:46,020 --> 02:11:47,750
need to do a quarter circle plus heavier
special for that so you can't just press

4718
02:11:47,750 --> 02:11:47,760
special for that so you can't just press
 

4719
02:11:47,760 --> 02:11:51,109
special for that so you can't just press
a button cool yeah it's actually heavy

4720
02:11:51,109 --> 02:11:51,119
a button cool yeah it's actually heavy
 

4721
02:11:51,119 --> 02:11:53,390
a button cool yeah it's actually heavy
yeah that will never happen or special

4722
02:11:53,390 --> 02:11:53,400
yeah that will never happen or special
 

4723
02:11:53,400 --> 02:11:55,010
yeah that will never happen or special
or special either one of those buttons

4724
02:11:55,010 --> 02:11:55,020
or special either one of those buttons
 

4725
02:11:55,020 --> 02:11:56,870
or special either one of those buttons
works but yeah you have to do it I mean

4726
02:11:56,870 --> 02:11:56,880
works but yeah you have to do it I mean
 

4727
02:11:56,880 --> 02:11:57,950

again okay so like it doesn't quite

4812
02:13:38,149 --> 02:13:38,159
again okay so like it doesn't quite
 

4813
02:13:38,159 --> 02:13:39,890
again okay so like it doesn't quite
mimic like this I don't think they can

4814

mimic like this I don't think they can
 

4815
02:13:39,900 --> 02:13:41,990
mimic like this I don't think they can
mimic the circular motion of like the

4816
02:13:41,990 --> 02:13:42,000
mimic the circular motion of like the
 

4817
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:45,109
mimic the circular motion of like the
joystick as well yeah I think it's a

4818
02:13:45,109 --> 02:13:45,119
joystick as well yeah I think it's a
 

4819
02:13:45,119 --> 02:13:46,729
joystick as well yeah I think it's a
little harder they're saying it's easier

4820
02:13:46,729 --> 02:13:46,739
little harder they're saying it's easier
 

4821
02:13:46,739 --> 02:13:49,129
little harder they're saying it's easier
though they're all saying really let me

4822
02:13:49,129 --> 02:13:49,139
though they're all saying really let me
 

4823
02:13:49,139 --> 02:13:50,629
though they're all saying really let me
try

her first stream from her training Arc

6562
02:55:03,950 --> 02:55:03,960
her first stream from her training Arc
 

6563
02:55:03,960 --> 02:55:07,190
her first stream from her training Arc

think it's true you know there were kids
 

9404
04:06:33,239 --> 04:06:35,510
think it's true you know there were kids
who were good at math and those subjects

9405
04:06:35,510 --> 04:06:35,520
who were good at math and those subjects
 

9406
04:06:35,520 --> 04:06:37,370
who were good at math and those subjects
and then they could they didn't do so

9407
04:06:37,370 --> 04:06:37,380
and then they could they didn't do so
 

9408
04:06:37,380 --> 04:06:40,010
and then they could they didn't do so
well in English and you know creative

9409
04:06:40,010 --> 04:06:40,020
well in English and you know creative
 

9410
04:06:40,020 --> 04:06:42,769
well in English and you know creative
subjects and all that and I was I was

9411
04:06:42,769 --> 04:06:42,779
subjects and all that and I was I was
 

9412
04:06:42,779 --> 04:06:45,229
subjects and all that and I was I was
not good at you know

9413
04:06:45,229 --> 04:06:45,239
not good at you know
 

9414
04:06:45,239 --> 04:06:47,269
not good at you know
it makes sense when you hear my top

9415
04:06:47,269 --> 04:06:47,279
it makes sense when you hear my top
 

9416
04:06:47,279 --> 04:06:49,729
it makes sense when you hear my top
three of subjects and bad ads

9417
04:06:49,729 --> 04:06:49,739
three of subjects and bad ads
 

9418
04:06:49,739 --> 04:06:53,630
three of subjects and bad ads
you can sense a pattern I think

9419
04:06:53,630 --> 04:06:53,640
you can sense a pattern I think
 

9420
04:06:53,640 --> 04:06:55,429
you can sense a pattern I think
because I was like

9421
04:06:55,429 --> 04:06:55,439
because I was like
 

9422
04:06:55,439 --> 04:06:57,410
because I was like
the pro

9423
04:06:57,410 --> 04:06:57,420
the pro
 

9424
04:06:57,420 --> 04:07:01,309
the pro
and English like linguistic and and

9425
04:07:01,309 --> 04:07:01,319
and English like linguistic and and
 

9426
04:07:01,319 --> 04:07:03,769
and English like linguistic and and
creative subjects

9427
04:07:03,769 --> 04:07:03,779
creative subjects
 

9428
04:07:03,779 --> 04:07:05,870
creative subjects
um

9429
04:07:05,870 --> 04:07:05,880
um
 

9430
04:07:05,880 --> 04:07:10,670
um
those were easy easy easy

9431
04:07:10,670 --> 04:07:10,680

 

9432
04:07:10,680 --> 04:07:13,309

oh I I wasn't like super good at history

9433
04:07:13,309 --> 04:07:13,319
oh I I wasn't like super good at history
 

9434
04:07:13,319 --> 04:07:15,530
oh I I wasn't like super good at history
but I really enjoyed it and and I was

9435
04:07:15,530 --> 04:07:15,540
but I really enjoyed it and and I was
 

9436
04:07:15,540 --> 04:07:17,030
but I really enjoyed it and and I was
like mid I think

9437
04:07:17,030 --> 04:07:17,040
like mid I think
 

9438
04:07:17,040 --> 04:07:21,830
like mid I think
history stuff

9439
04:07:21,830 --> 04:07:21,840

 

9440
04:07:21,840 --> 04:07:24,590

I think

9441
04:07:24,590 --> 04:07:24,600
I think
 

9442
04:07:24,600 --> 04:07:26,389
I think
a lot of depends on the teacher yeah one

9443
04:07:26,389 --> 04:07:26,399
a lot of depends on the teacher yeah one
 

9444
04:07:26,399 --> 04:07:28,969
a lot of depends on the teacher yeah one
problem I had with math was that three

9445
04:07:28,969 --> 04:07:28,979
problem I had with math was that three
 

9446
04:07:28,979 --> 04:07:32,870
problem I had with math was that three
years in a row but even I guess

9447
04:07:32,870 --> 04:07:32,880
years in a row but even I guess
 

9448
04:07:32,880 --> 04:07:34,070
years in a row but even I guess
if you count

9449
04:07:34,070 --> 04:07:34,080
if you count
 

9450
04:07:34,080 --> 04:07:36,650
if you count
Junior High and High School

9451
04:07:36,650 --> 04:07:36,660
Junior High and High School
 

9452
04:07:36,660 --> 04:07:39,290
Junior High and High School
probably like five to six years in a row

9453
04:07:39,290 --> 04:07:39,300
probably like five to six years in a row
 

9454
04:07:39,300 --> 04:07:41,389
probably like five to six years in a row
I continuously

9455
04:07:41,389 --> 04:07:41,399
I continuously
 

9456
04:07:41,399 --> 04:07:44,210
I continuously
had a diff or even

9457
04:07:44,210 --> 04:07:44,220
had a diff or even
 

9458
04:07:44,220 --> 04:07:47,990
had a diff or even
yeah yeah six years in a row

9459
04:07:47,990 --> 04:07:48,000
yeah yeah six years in a row
 

9460
04:07:48,000 --> 04:07:52,309
yeah yeah six years in a row
I had a different map teacher each year

9461
04:07:52,309 --> 04:07:52,319

 

9462
04:07:52,319 --> 04:07:55,670

for reasons of switching schools many

9463
04:07:55,670 --> 04:07:55,680
for reasons of switching schools many
 

9464
04:07:55,680 --> 04:07:58,330
for reasons of switching schools many
times

9465
04:07:58,330 --> 04:07:58,340

 

9466
04:07:58,340 --> 04:08:02,750

and yeah so each teacher had a different

9467
04:08:02,750 --> 04:08:02,760
and yeah so each teacher had a different
 

9468
04:08:02,760 --> 04:08:05,630
and yeah so each teacher had a different
way of teaching

9469
04:08:05,630 --> 04:08:05,640
way of teaching
 

9470
04:08:05,640 --> 04:08:08,750
way of teaching
um no it's not normal normally we

9471
04:08:08,750 --> 04:08:08,760
um no it's not normal normally we
 

9472
04:08:08,760 --> 04:08:12,769
um no it's not normal normally we
usually have like the same teacher

9473
04:08:12,769 --> 04:08:12,779
usually have like the same teacher
 

9474
04:08:12,779 --> 04:08:16,729
usually have like the same teacher
if you stay in the same school and like

9475
04:08:16,729 --> 04:08:16,739
if you stay in the same school and like
 

9476
04:08:16,739 --> 04:08:17,929
if you stay in the same school and like
in the same class because you don't

9477
04:08:17,929 --> 04:08:17,939
in the same class because you don't
 

9478
04:08:17,939 --> 04:08:19,969
in the same class because you don't
repeat a year normally you have the same

9479
04:08:19,969 --> 04:08:19,979
repeat a year normally you have the same
 

9480
04:08:19,979 --> 04:08:22,309
repeat a year normally you have the same
teacher here

9481
04:08:22,309 --> 04:08:22,319
teacher here
 

9482
04:08:22,319 --> 04:08:26,150
teacher here
that's normal in us oh but not here and

9483
04:08:26,150 --> 04:08:26,160
that's normal in us oh but not here and
 

9484
04:08:26,160 --> 04:08:27,469
that's normal in us oh but not here and
I would have personally I really

9485
04:08:27,469 --> 04:08:27,479
I would have personally I really
 

9486
04:08:27,479 --> 04:08:31,610
I would have personally I really
appreciated keeping the same teacher

9487
04:08:31,610 --> 04:08:31,620

 

9488
04:08:31,620 --> 04:08:33,889

it was challenging for me to have a

9489
04:08:33,889 --> 04:08:33,899
it was challenging for me to have a
 

9490
04:08:33,899 --> 04:08:35,570
it was challenging for me to have a
different teacher and then get used to

9491
04:08:35,570 --> 04:08:35,580
different teacher and then get used to
 

9492
04:08:35,580 --> 04:08:37,729
different teacher and then get used to
that the way they teach it they were all

9493
04:08:37,729 --> 04:08:37,739
that the way they teach it they were all
 

9494
04:08:37,739 --> 04:08:41,650
that the way they teach it they were all
kind of different difficult and weird

9495
04:08:41,650 --> 04:08:41,660
kind of different difficult and weird
 

9496
04:08:41,660 --> 04:08:48,349
kind of different difficult and weird
they all had like weird quirks

9497
04:08:48,349 --> 04:08:48,359

 

9498
04:08:48,359 --> 04:08:50,210

and also like

9499
04:08:50,210 --> 04:08:50,220
and also like
 

9500
04:08:50,220 --> 04:08:52,070
and also like
when the year starts and you have this

9501
04:08:52,070 --> 04:08:52,080
when the year starts and you have this
 

9502
04:08:52,080 --> 04:08:54,410
when the year starts and you have this
different teacher a lot of time they

9503
04:08:54,410 --> 04:08:54,420
different teacher a lot of time they
 

9504
04:08:54,420 --> 04:08:55,429
different teacher a lot of time they
didn't

9505
04:08:55,429 --> 04:08:55,439
didn't
 

9506
04:08:55,439 --> 04:08:59,750
didn't
pick up where the others left

9507
04:08:59,750 --> 04:08:59,760

 

9508
04:08:59,760 --> 04:09:04,250

um that was also confusing

9509
04:09:04,250 --> 04:09:04,260

 

9510
04:09:04,260 --> 04:09:06,469

Math teachers are just weird

9511
04:09:06,469 --> 04:09:06,479
Math teachers are just weird
 

9512
04:09:06,479 --> 04:09:11,030
Math teachers are just weird
they're now I wouldn't say they're weird

9513
04:09:11,030 --> 04:09:11,040

 

9514
04:09:11,040 --> 04:09:14,570

uh but they're they're yeah the strict I

9515
04:09:14,570 --> 04:09:14,580
uh but they're they're yeah the strict I
 

9516
04:09:14,580 --> 04:09:16,929
uh but they're they're yeah the strict I
always had strict Math teachers

9517
04:09:16,929 --> 04:09:16,939
always had strict Math teachers
 

9518
04:09:16,939 --> 04:09:20,809
always had strict Math teachers
is it I don't want to say they're all

9519
04:09:20,809 --> 04:09:20,819
is it I don't want to say they're all
 

9520
04:09:20,819 --> 04:09:23,030
is it I don't want to say they're all
strict but for me

9521
04:09:23,030 --> 04:09:23,040
strict but for me
 

9522
04:09:23,040 --> 04:09:25,370
strict but for me
all my math teachers were the strict

9523
04:09:25,370 --> 04:09:25,380
all my math teachers were the strict
 

9524
04:09:25,380 --> 04:09:28,010
all my math teachers were the strict
teachers

9525
04:09:28,010 --> 04:09:28,020

 

9526
04:09:28,020 --> 04:09:31,130

and all my like German and English

9527
04:09:31,130 --> 04:09:31,140
and all my like German and English
 

9528
04:09:31,140 --> 04:09:34,790
and all my like German and English
teachers were sweet teachers

9529
04:09:34,790 --> 04:09:34,800
teachers were sweet teachers
 

9530
04:09:34,800 --> 04:09:39,830
teachers were sweet teachers
really sweet

9531
04:09:39,830 --> 04:09:39,840

 

9532
04:09:39,840 --> 04:09:42,110

it's just the Math teachers for me they

9533
04:09:42,110 --> 04:09:42,120
it's just the Math teachers for me they
 

9534
04:09:42,120 --> 04:09:43,969
it's just the Math teachers for me they
were all strict and it makes kind of

9535
04:09:43,969 --> 04:09:43,979
were all strict and it makes kind of
 

9536
04:09:43,979 --> 04:09:47,870
were all strict and it makes kind of
sense to me it fits math to be strict

9537
04:09:47,870 --> 04:09:47,880
sense to me it fits math to be strict
 

9538
04:09:47,880 --> 04:09:50,330
sense to me it fits math to be strict
that just makes sense it's just

9539
04:09:50,330 --> 04:09:50,340
that just makes sense it's just
 

9540
04:09:50,340 --> 04:09:54,110
that just makes sense it's just
it's a match made in heaven

9541
04:09:54,110 --> 04:09:54,120

 

9542
04:09:54,120 --> 04:09:55,790

yeah

9543
04:09:55,790 --> 04:09:55,800
yeah
 

9544
04:09:55,800 --> 04:09:58,429
yeah
different person are you

9545
04:09:58,429 --> 04:09:58,439
different person are you
 

9546
04:09:58,439 --> 04:10:00,469
different person are you
you like your Math teachers

9547
04:10:00,469 --> 04:10:00,479
you like your Math teachers
 

9548
04:10:00,479 --> 04:10:03,950
you like your Math teachers
well I I liked them as a person somewhat

9549
04:10:03,950 --> 04:10:03,960
well I I liked them as a person somewhat
 

9550
04:10:03,960 --> 04:10:06,290
well I I liked them as a person somewhat
too

9551
04:10:06,290 --> 04:10:06,300
too
 

9552
04:10:06,300 --> 04:10:08,630
too
when I felt so

9553
04:10:08,630 --> 04:10:08,640
when I felt so
 

9554
04:10:08,640 --> 04:10:14,450
when I felt so
useless and bad and wow my self-value as

9555
04:10:14,450 --> 04:10:14,460
useless and bad and wow my self-value as
 

9556
04:10:14,460 --> 04:10:16,910
useless and bad and wow my self-value as
a child was

9557
04:10:16,910 --> 04:10:16,920
a child was
 

9558
04:10:16,920 --> 04:10:20,210
a child was
as a student absolutely destroyed

9559
04:10:20,210 --> 04:10:20,220
as a student absolutely destroyed
 

9560
04:10:20,220 --> 04:10:23,570
as a student absolutely destroyed
because I failed

9561
04:10:23,570 --> 04:10:23,580
because I failed
 

9562
04:10:23,580 --> 04:10:26,630
because I failed
so much and I feel like that contributed

9563
04:10:26,630 --> 04:10:26,640
so much and I feel like that contributed
 

9564
04:10:26,640 --> 04:10:31,550
so much and I feel like that contributed
to me continuously failing even more

9565
04:10:31,550 --> 04:10:31,560
to me continuously failing even more
 

9566
04:10:31,560 --> 04:10:34,550
to me continuously failing even more
because once I had that in my mind that

9567
04:10:34,550 --> 04:10:34,560
because once I had that in my mind that
 

9568
04:10:34,560 --> 04:10:36,290
because once I had that in my mind that
I'm bad at math

9569
04:10:36,290 --> 04:10:36,300
I'm bad at math
 

9570
04:10:36,300 --> 04:10:39,229
I'm bad at math
I think that was like blocking me

9571
04:10:39,229 --> 04:10:39,239
