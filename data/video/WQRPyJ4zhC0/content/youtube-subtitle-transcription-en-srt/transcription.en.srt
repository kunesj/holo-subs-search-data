because like here is an arrow as well
 

5797
02:27:27,080 --> 02:27:28,870
because like here is an arrow as well
but that Arrow automatically goes up

into here and somebody goes into here

6360
02:40:30,469 --> 02:40:30,479
into here and somebody goes into here
 

6361
02:40:30,479 --> 02:40:32,910
into here and somebody goes into here
and we just have to figure out what it

6362
02:40:32,910 --> 02:40:32,920
and we just have to figure out what it
 

6363
02:40:32,920 --> 02:40:36,230
and we just have to figure out what it
is that both of us going into there

6364
02:40:36,230 --> 02:40:36,240
is that both of us going into there
 

6365
02:40:36,240 --> 02:40:38,190
is that both of us going into there
activates I hope it's not a thing where

6366
02:40:38,190 --> 02:40:38,200
activates I hope it's not a thing where
 

6367
02:40:38,200 --> 02:40:40,269
activates I hope it's not a thing where
you need more than three

6368
02:40:40,269 --> 02:40:40,279
you need more than three
 

6369
02:40:40,279 --> 02:40:43,469
you need more than three
people no no they said it's everything's

6370
02:40:43,469 --> 02:40:43,479
people no no they said it's everything's
 

6371
02:40:43,479 --> 02:40:47,150
people no no they said it's everything's
doable with just one person with one

6372
02:40:47,150 --> 02:40:47,160
doable with just one person with one
 

6373
02:40:47,160 --> 02:40:50,550
doable with just one person with one
okay nice yeah

6374
02:40:50,550 --> 02:40:50,560
okay nice yeah
 

6375
02:40:50,560 --> 02:40:51,630
okay nice yeah
actually I don't know how the puzzle

6376
02:40:51,630 --> 02:40:51,640
actually I don't know how the puzzle
 

6377
02:40:51,640 --> 02:40:52,950
actually I don't know how the puzzle
earlier would have been possible but I

6378
02:40:52,950 --> 02:40:52,960
earlier would have been possible but I
 

6379
02:40:52,960 --> 02:40:54,870
earlier would have been possible but I
doubt there okay I'm going to reset it

6380
02:40:54,870 --> 02:40:54,880
doubt there okay I'm going to reset it
 

6381
02:40:54,880 --> 02:40:59,070
doubt there okay I'm going to reset it
so that he goes into the F right one

6382
02:40:59,070 --> 02:40:59,080
so that he goes into the F right one
 

6383
02:40:59,080 --> 02:41:01,910
so that he goes into the F right one
okay well that one

6384
02:41:01,910 --> 02:41:01,920

 

6385
02:41:01,920 --> 02:41:05,429

though oh wait what was it he goes this

6386
02:41:05,429 --> 02:41:05,439
though oh wait what was it he goes this
 

6387
02:41:05,439 --> 02:41:08,670
though oh wait what was it he goes this
way this is kind of easy who says this

6388
02:41:08,670 --> 02:41:08,680
way this is kind of easy who says this
 

6389
02:41:08,680 --> 02:41:11,269
way this is kind of easy who says this
is easy they think it's easy cuz they

6390
02:41:11,269 --> 02:41:11,279
is easy they think it's easy cuz they
 

6391
02:41:11,279 --> 02:41:13,230
is easy they think it's easy cuz they
don't actually get

6392
02:41:13,230 --> 02:41:13,240
don't actually get
 

6393
02:41:13,240 --> 02:41:16,630
don't actually get
it are they fibbing they're

6394
