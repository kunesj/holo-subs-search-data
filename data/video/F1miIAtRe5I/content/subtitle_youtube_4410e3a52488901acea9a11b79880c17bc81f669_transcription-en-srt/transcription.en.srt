most likely last one right

188
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:45,140
most likely last one right
 

189
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:48,650
most likely last one right
uh ryza game would go and I was like

190
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:48,660
uh ryza game would go and I was like
 

191
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,570
uh ryza game would go and I was like
already really surprised when they

192
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:50,580
already really surprised when they
 

193
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,870
already really surprised when they
decided to do ryza 2 because I didn't

194
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:53,880
decided to do ryza 2 because I didn't
 

195
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,590
decided to do ryza 2 because I didn't
expect it at all

196
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:56,600
expect it at all
 

197
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,590
expect it at all
uh and then you know after right at two

198
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:00,600
uh and then you know after right at two
 

199
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,630
uh and then you know after right at two
it was like all right all right rise is

200
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:02,640
it was like all right all right rise is
 

201

205
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,389

00:59:39,549 --> 00:59:39,559
I think it's the same okay
 

1793
00:59:39,559 --> 00:59:42,589
I think it's the same okay
do I remember this at all it's been like

1794
00:59:42,589 --> 00:59:42,599
do I remember this at all it's been like
 

1795
00:59:42,599 --> 00:59:46,370
do I remember this at all it's been like
over a year I think

1796
00:59:46,370 --> 00:59:46,380

 

1797
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:48,650

of ingredient that can be used there are

1800
00:59:50,809 --> 00:59:50,819
of ingredient that can be used there are
 

1801
00:59:50,819 --> 00:59:53,750
of ingredient that can be used there are
also elements fire ice cold air I think

1802
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:53,760
also elements fire ice cold air I think
 

1803
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:57,170
also elements fire ice cold air I think
I remember that oh boy

1804
00:59:57,170 --> 00:59:57,180

 

1805
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:59,690

ingredients also have elements and when

1806
00:59:59,690 --> 00:59:59,700
ingredients also have elements and when
 

1807
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:02,270
ingredients also have elements and when
an ingredient with the same element as

1808
01:00:02,270 --> 01:00:02,280
an ingredient with the same element as
 

1809
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:04,789
an ingredient with the same element as
those in the material Loop is used the

1810
01:00:04,789 --> 01:00:04,799
those in the material Loop is used the
 

1811
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:06,770
those in the material Loop is used the
element balance will be accumulated uh

1812
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:06,780
element balance will be accumulated uh
 

1813
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:09,049
element balance will be accumulated uh
okay sure I read that if I understood

1814
01:00:09,049 --> 01:00:09,059
okay sure I read that if I understood
 

1815
01:00:09,059 --> 01:00:13,430
okay sure I read that if I understood
that is another story but will be fun

1816
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:13,440
that is another story but will be fun

are accumulated the material Loop will

1820
01:00:18,109 --> 01:00:18,119
are accumulated the material Loop will
 

1821
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:25,990
are accumulated the material Loop will
be leveled up and become more effective

1822
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:26,000

 

1823
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,069

remember this oh
 

1865
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,470
remember this oh
they put it on top of here that's cool

1866

dragging pulling it out and then putting

11394
05:34:53,990 --> 05:34:54,000
dragging pulling it out and then putting
 

11395
05:34:54,000 --> 05:34:56,330
dragging pulling it out and then putting
it back in but the same thing happened

11396

again and then it seemed like it showed
 

11401
05:35:00,060 --> 05:35:02,810
again and then it seemed like it showed
me a sign I think that was saying that

11402
05:35:02,810 --> 05:35:02,820
me a sign I think that was saying that
 

11403
05:35:02,820 --> 05:35:05,510
me a sign I think that was saying that
there was almost no black ink left when

11404
05:35:05,510 --> 05:35:05,520
there was almost no black ink left when
 

11405
05:35:05,520 --> 05:35:07,610
there was almost no black ink left when
it was when after it managed to finally

11406
05:35:07,610 --> 05:35:07,620
it was when after it managed to finally
 

11407
05:35:07,620 --> 05:35:10,910
it was when after it managed to finally
print one page and then get stuck again

11408
05:35:10,910 --> 05:35:10,920
print one page and then get stuck again
 

11409
05:35:10,920 --> 05:35:16,070
print one page and then get stuck again
so I actually had some fresh ink for the

11410
05:35:16,070 --> 05:35:16,080
so I actually had some fresh ink for the
 

11411
05:35:16,080 --> 05:35:18,230
so I actually had some fresh ink for the
