anymore yeah she surely tell that one
guard but I thought she would also like

4730
03:02:11,550 --> 03:02:11,560
guard but I thought she would also like
 

4731
03:02:11,560 --> 03:02:12,830
guard but I thought she would also like
play a bigger role in like

4732
03:02:12,830 --> 03:02:12,840
play a bigger role in like
 

4733
03:02:12,840 --> 03:02:14,790
play a bigger role in like
differentiating them and and like I I

4734
03:02:14,790 --> 03:02:14,800
differentiating them and and like I I
 

4735
03:02:14,800 --> 03:02:16,150
differentiating them and and like I I
would think she would like really be the

4736
03:02:16,150 --> 03:02:16,160
would think she would like really be the
 

4737
03:02:16,160 --> 03:02:19,070
would think she would like really be the
the one who makes it clear and then the

4738
03:02:19,070 --> 03:02:19,080
the one who makes it clear and then the
 

4739
03:02:19,080 --> 03:02:20,830
the one who makes it clear and then the
queen will be even more thankful to her

4740
03:02:20,830 --> 03:02:20,840
queen will be even more thankful to her
 

4741
03:02:20,840 --> 03:02:22,790
queen will be even more thankful to her
so I don't know um but she didn't show

4742
03:02:22,790 --> 03:02:22,800
so I don't know um but she didn't show
 

4743
03:02:22,800 --> 03:02:25,229
so I don't know um but she didn't show
up anymore which is kind of

4744
03:02:25,229 --> 03:02:25,239
up anymore which is kind of
 

4745
03:02:25,239 --> 03:02:28,550
up anymore which is kind of
weird and then I thought I thought like

4746
03:02:28,550 --> 03:02:28,560
weird and then I thought I thought like
 

4747
03:02:28,560 --> 03:02:31,190
weird and then I thought I thought like
at the point where one is dead I thought

4748
03:02:31,190 --> 03:02:31,200
at the point where one is dead I thought
 

4749
03:02:31,200 --> 03:02:32,550
at the point where one is dead I thought
it would be it would have been

4750
03:02:32,550 --> 03:02:32,560
it would be it would have been
 

4751
03:02:32,560 --> 03:02:35,309
it would be it would have been
interesting if the one that

4752
03:02:35,309 --> 03:02:35,319
interesting if the one that
 

4753
03:02:35,319 --> 03:02:39,110
interesting if the one that
remains she uh uh she re neighbor would

4754
03:02:39,110 --> 03:02:39,120
remains she uh uh she re neighbor would
 

4755
03:02:39,120 --> 03:02:41,870
remains she uh uh she re neighbor would
be like okay but are you the real one

4756
03:02:41,870 --> 03:02:41,880
be like okay but are you the real one
 

4757
03:02:41,880 --> 03:02:43,790
be like okay but are you the real one
and he'll have to prove himself but it's

4758
03:02:43,790 --> 03:02:43,800
and he'll have to prove himself but it's
 

4759
03:02:43,800 --> 03:02:46,309
and he'll have to prove himself but it's
not like one is dead one is dead so how

4760
03:02:46,309 --> 03:02:46,319
not like one is dead one is dead so how
 

4761
03:02:46,319 --> 03:02:49,150
not like one is dead one is dead so how
can the remaining one really ever be

4762
03:02:49,150 --> 03:02:49,160
can the remaining one really ever be
 

4763
03:02:49,160 --> 03:02:50,190
can the remaining one really ever be
truly

4764
03:02:50,190 --> 03:02:50,200
truly
 

4765
03:02:50,200 --> 03:02:55,030
truly
trusted uh cuz you could ask if they're

4766
03:02:55,030 --> 03:02:55,040
trusted uh cuz you could ask if they're
 

4767
03:02:55,040 --> 03:02:56,590
trusted uh cuz you could ask if they're
both Al life you could ask both of the

4768
03:02:56,590 --> 03:02:56,600
both Al life you could ask both of the
 

4769
03:02:56,600 --> 03:02:57,910
both Al life you could ask both of the
questions and you can probably figure it

4770
03:02:57,910 --> 03:02:57,920
questions and you can probably figure it
 

4771
03:02:57,920 --> 03:02:59,830
questions and you can probably figure it
out but if there's only one alive

4772
03:02:59,830 --> 03:02:59,840
out but if there's only one alive
 

4773
03:02:59,840 --> 03:03:01,870
out but if there's only one alive
there's no one not his other twin

4774
03:03:01,870 --> 03:03:01,880
there's no one not his other twin
 

4775
03:03:01,880 --> 03:03:04,389
there's no one not his other twin
wouldn't be there to disprove him so he

4776
03:03:04,389 --> 03:03:04,399
wouldn't be there to disprove him so he
 

4777
03:03:04,399 --> 03:03:09,110
wouldn't be there to disprove him so he
could continue to infiltrate and and uh

4778
03:03:09,110 --> 03:03:09,120
could continue to infiltrate and and uh
 

4779
03:03:09,120 --> 03:03:12,630
could continue to infiltrate and and uh
act as his other twin brother you know

4780
03:03:12,630 --> 03:03:12,640
act as his other twin brother you know
 

4781
03:03:12,640 --> 03:03:14,990
act as his other twin brother you know
but then he just suddenly yeah he just

4782
03:03:14,990 --> 03:03:15,000
but then he just suddenly yeah he just
 

4783
03:03:15,000 --> 03:03:18,150
but then he just suddenly yeah he just
commits to do I'm like what wait what

4784
03:03:18,150 --> 03:03:18,160
commits to do I'm like what wait what
 

4785
03:03:18,160 --> 03:03:20,110
commits to do I'm like what wait what
about this whole Arc I had in my head

4786
03:03:20,110 --> 03:03:20,120
about this whole Arc I had in my head
 

4787
03:03:20,120 --> 03:03:22,030
about this whole Arc I had in my head
now where you could have made it really

4788
03:03:22,030 --> 03:03:22,040
now where you could have made it really
 

4789
03:03:22,040 --> 03:03:24,349
now where you could have made it really
interesting in deceiving them even

4790
03:03:24,349 --> 03:03:24,359
interesting in deceiving them even
 

4791
03:03:24,359 --> 03:03:27,150
interesting in deceiving them even
further and infiltrating them even

4792
03:03:27,150 --> 03:03:27,160
further and infiltrating them even
 

4793
03:03:27,160 --> 03:03:29,429
further and infiltrating them even
further that's not where I thought this

4794
03:03:29,429 --> 03:03:29,439
further that's not where I thought this
 

4795
03:03:29,439 --> 03:03:30,349
further that's not where I thought this
was

4796
03:03:30,349 --> 03:03:30,359
was
 

4797
03:03:30,359 --> 03:03:36,469
was
going you thinking the same right

4798
03:03:36,469 --> 03:03:36,479
going you thinking the same right
 

4799
03:03:36,479 --> 03:03:39,630
going you thinking the same right
bro well obviously the one that was you

4800
03:03:39,630 --> 03:03:39,640
bro well obviously the one that was you
 

4801
03:03:39,640 --> 03:03:43,190
bro well obviously the one that was you
know slicing himself up in the end was

4802
03:03:43,190 --> 03:03:43,200
know slicing himself up in the end was
 

4803
03:03:43,200 --> 03:03:47,030
know slicing himself up in the end was
the good one the real one um but let's

4804
03:03:47,030 --> 03:03:47,040
the good one the real one um but let's
 

4805
03:03:47,040 --> 03:03:49,510
the good one the real one um but let's
say that it was the other way around

4806
03:03:49,510 --> 03:03:49,520
say that it was the other way around
 

4807
03:03:49,520 --> 03:03:51,670
say that it was the other way around
then he could have totally just stayed

4808
03:03:51,670 --> 03:03:51,680
then he could have totally just stayed
 

4809
03:03:51,680 --> 03:03:55,030
then he could have totally just stayed
alive and infiltrated and because it

4810
03:03:55,030 --> 03:03:55,040
alive and infiltrated and because it
 

4811
03:03:55,040 --> 03:03:56,870
alive and infiltrated and because it
wasn't exactly that I understand that

4812
03:03:56,870 --> 03:03:56,880
wasn't exactly that I understand that
 

4813
03:03:56,880 --> 03:03:58,349
wasn't exactly that I understand that
but then why didn't the book do it

4814
03:03:58,349 --> 03:03:58,359
but then why didn't the book do it
 

4815
03:03:58,359 --> 03:04:00,510
but then why didn't the book do it
differently this wasn't even this wasn't

4816
03:04:00,510 --> 03:04:00,520
differently this wasn't even this wasn't
 

4817
03:04:00,520 --> 03:04:02,469
differently this wasn't even this wasn't
as interesting as it could have been in

4818
03:04:02,469 --> 03:04:02,479
as interesting as it could have been in
 

4819
03:04:02,479 --> 03:04:05,070
as interesting as it could have been in
my opinion you know what I

4820

differently that the remaining one was
 

4831
03:04:17,160 --> 03:04:22,630
differently that the remaining one was
the evil

enough into any of these characters to
 

4853
03:04:48,239 --> 03:04:49,830
enough into any of these characters to
facilate this kind of Storytelling it

4854

there
 

4861
03:04:55,880 --> 03:04:58,389
there
a so they actually probably made a

4862
03:04:58,389 --> 03:04:58,399
a so they actually probably made a
 

4863
03:04:58,399 --> 03:05:00,309
a so they actually probably made a
bigger deal out of it than it was in the

4864
03:05:00,309 --> 03:05:00,319
bigger deal out of it than it was in the
 

4865
03:05:00,319 --> 03:05:02,990
bigger deal out of it than it was in the
books well that's that's unfortunate

books well that's that's unfortunate
 

4867
03:05:03,000 --> 03:05:06,750
books well that's that's unfortunate
that uh you you you you kind of start

that uh you you you you kind of start
 

4869
03:05:06,760 --> 03:05:08,510
that uh you you you you kind of start
making a big deal of out of it but then

4870
03:05:08,510 --> 03:05:08,520
making a big deal of out of it but then
 

4871
03:05:08,520 --> 03:05:12,950
making a big deal of out of it but then
you ended so in such a lame

4872
03:05:12,950 --> 03:05:12,960
you ended so in such a lame
 

4873
03:05:12,960 --> 03:05:15,830
you ended so in such a lame
way there was more potential there I

4874
03:05:15,830 --> 03:05:15,840
way there was more potential there I
 

4875
03:05:15,840 --> 03:05:18,429
way there was more potential there I
want to say
