343
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:42,710

going to go somewhere with a borrowed girl in February, but I

344
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:42,720
going to go somewhere with a borrowed girl in February, but I
 

345
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,710
going to go somewhere with a borrowed girl in February, but I
just can't stand it anymore.  Tou: I'll be

leaving Japan once February is over,
 

349
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:55,850
leaving Japan once February is over,
so I'm thinking that I'd like to see Atsuko a little more soon,

350
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:55,860

 

351
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:59,389

but it's a little tough because of some things.  It's

352
00:11:59,389 --> 00:11:59,399
but it's a little tough because of some things.  It's
 

353
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:06,350
but it's a little tough because of some things.  It's
been a year and I've only had one good trip, you idiot.I

But it's okay. I try to avoid places with lots of people,

361
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:19,630
But it's okay. I try to avoid places with lots of people,
 

362
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:24,230

Someone told me that it does happen sometimes,

385
00:13:06,009 --> 00:13:06,019
Someone told me that it does happen sometimes,
 

386
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:11,619
Someone told me that it does happen sometimes,
but not as often as in the past, and I used to live in Kansai.

00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:19,670
Once upon a time, not this year, not long ago, I
knew that something like that would happen in the Kansai region.  I

391
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,900
knew that something like that would happen in the Kansai region.  I

398
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:37,810

learned a lot of Kansai dialect, so I didn't ask to learn it,

399
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:37,820
learned a lot of Kansai dialect, so I didn't ask to learn it,
 

400
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:41,879
learned a lot of Kansai dialect, so I didn't ask to learn it,

were involved in that, you would
 

404
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:51,020
were involved in that, you would
have memorized Kansai dialect.After that, everyone was complaining, but you're the one who doesn't speak Kansai dialect.  I do

405
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:51,030
have memorized Kansai dialect.After that, everyone was complaining, but you're the one who doesn't speak Kansai dialect.  I do

2144
01:10:27,870 --> 01:10:30,980
been to Disneyland a few times.  I think it was once or three times. I think it
was once as a receiver. It

2145
01:10:30,980 --> 01:10:30,990
was once as a receiver. It
 

2146
01:10:30,990 --> 01:10:35,729
was once as a receiver. It
was quite fun, but the scenes might have been more fun.

2147
01:10:35,729 --> 01:10:35,739
was quite fun, but the scenes might have been more fun.

looking for a restaurant inside Disney,

2228
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:21,170
looking for a restaurant inside Disney,
 

2229
01:13:21,170 --> 01:13:23,419
looking for a restaurant inside Disney,
but I couldn't find it.There was

2230
01:13:23,419 --> 01:13:23,429
but I couldn't find it.There was
 

2231
01:13:23,429 --> 01:13:27,709
but I couldn't find it.There was
nothing vacant, so I decided not to go there today.  There

2232
01:13:27,709 --> 01:13:29,320
nothing vacant, so I decided not to go there today.  There
 

2233
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:29,330

 

2234
01:13:29,330 --> 01:13:32,740

was only a small snack that was written there,

2235
01:13:32,740 --> 01:13:32,750
was only a small snack that was written there,
 

2236
01:13:32,750 --> 01:13:40,090
was only a small snack that was written there,
so I found just one lesson and found that wrestler who was supposed to be vacant,

2237
01:13:40,090 --> 01:13:40,100
so I found just one lesson and found that wrestler who was supposed to be vacant,

2240
01:13:42,710 --> 01:13:45,300
but I
didn't feel like there was a key to doing something.

2241
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:45,310
didn't feel like there was a key to doing something.
 

2242
01:13:45,310 --> 01:13:48,570
didn't feel like there was a key to doing something.
Although it wasn't a solo role, I felt a great sense of freedom.When I

2243
01:13:48,570 --> 01:13:48,580
Although it wasn't a solo role, I felt a great sense of freedom.When I
 

2244
01:13:48,580 --> 01:13:54,700
Although it wasn't a solo role, I felt a great sense of freedom.When I
went to the restaurant, I believe it opened 3 hours after middle school,

2245
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:54,710
went to the restaurant, I believe it opened 3 hours after middle school,

01:13:54,710 --> 01:13:57,030
went to the restaurant, I believe it opened 3 hours after middle school,
which was 3 hours longer.It

2247
01:13:57,030 --> 01:13:57,040
which was 3 hours longer.It
 

2248
01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:01,410
which was 3 hours longer.It
said it would open at 4 o'clock,

2249
01:14:01,410 --> 01:14:01,420
said it would open at 4 o'clock,
 

2250
01:14:01,420 --> 01:14:04,540
said it would open at 4 o'clock,
but when I went at 8 o'clock...  It looks

2251
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:06,080
but when I went at 8 o'clock...  It looks
 

2252
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:06,090

 

2253
01:14:06,090 --> 01:14:10,069

like I'm going to close it and there's no

rice.

01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:12,730
rice.
 

2257
01:14:12,730 --> 01:14:17,390
rice.
If it's not strange, it's not amazing.

2258
01:14:17,390 --> 01:14:22,810
If it's not strange, it's not amazing.
 

2259
