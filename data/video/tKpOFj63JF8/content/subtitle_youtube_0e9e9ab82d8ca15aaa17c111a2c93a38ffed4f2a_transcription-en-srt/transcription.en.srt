about
 

2584
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:11,430
about
it is okay i'll do a mock one okay this

2585
01:07:11,430 --> 01:07:11,440
it is okay i'll do a mock one okay this
 

2586
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:12,549

should we do the work this isn't this is

2609
01:07:49,029 --> 01:07:49,039
should we do the work this isn't this is
 

2610

yeah this looks right okay imagine if
 

2616
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:55,510
yeah this looks right okay imagine if
this was one higher on the ground then

2617
01:07:55,510 --> 01:07:55,520
this was one higher on the ground then
 

2618
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:56,470
this was one higher on the ground then
it would make sense

2619
01:07:56,470 --> 01:07:56,480
it would make sense
 

2620
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:59,990
it would make sense
yeah sounds good i have the coordinates

2621
01:07:59,990 --> 01:08:00,000
yeah sounds good i have the coordinates
 

2622
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:00,710
yeah sounds good i have the coordinates
don't worry

2623
01:08:00,710 --> 01:08:00,720
