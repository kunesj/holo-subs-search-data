oh really that's good though yeah and I

4042
02:00:52,430 --> 02:00:52,440
oh really that's good though yeah and I
 

4043
02:00:52,440 --> 02:00:54,629
oh really that's good though yeah and I
think in Germany it's one to six and

4044
02:00:54,629 --> 02:00:54,639
think in Germany it's one to six and
 

4045
02:00:54,639 --> 02:00:57,589
think in Germany it's one to six and
with a five you can maybe still pass but

4046
02:00:57,589 --> 02:00:57,599
with a five you can maybe still pass but
 

4047
02:00:57,599 --> 02:00:59,669
with a five you can maybe still pass but
I I find it amazing that there's one to

4048
02:00:59,669 --> 02:00:59,679
I I find it amazing that there's one to
 

4049
02:00:59,679 --> 02:01:03,709
I I find it amazing that there's one to
six 1 to 10 I mean in Italy because

4050
02:01:03,709 --> 02:01:03,719
six 1 to 10 I mean in Italy because
 

4051
02:01:03,719 --> 02:01:06,149
six 1 to 10 I mean in Italy because
then like what's the if you already

4052
02:01:06,149 --> 02:01:06,159
then like what's the if you already
 

4053
02:01:06,159 --> 02:01:09,430
then like what's the if you already
don't pass with a five what's the point

4054
02:01:09,430 --> 02:01:09,440
don't pass with a five what's the point
 

4055
02:01:09,440 --> 02:01:13,390
don't pass with a five what's the point
of having 1 2 3 4 five so um cuz you say

4056
02:01:13,390 --> 02:01:13,400
of having 1 2 3 4 five so um cuz you say
 

4057
02:01:13,400 --> 02:01:16,589
of having 1 2 3 4 five so um cuz you say
minimum is six I think it counts on the

4058
02:01:16,589 --> 02:01:16,599
minimum is six I think it counts on the
 

4059
02:01:16,599 --> 02:01:18,470
minimum is six I think it counts on the
average

4060
02:01:18,470 --> 02:01:18,480
average
 

4061
02:01:18,480 --> 02:01:21,550
average
