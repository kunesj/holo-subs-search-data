00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,829
up a hill yeah it's crazy it's always at
an incline

182
00:09:02,829 --> 00:09:02,839
an incline
 

183
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:06,030
an incline
yeah but walking was pretty comfortable

184
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:06,040
yeah but walking was pretty comfortable
 

185
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,990
yeah but walking was pretty comfortable
uh I feel like I was able to walk

186
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,000
uh I feel like I was able to walk
 

187
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,790
uh I feel like I was able to walk
comfortably for a longer time today than

188
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:10,800
comfortably for a longer time today than
 

189
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,269
comfortably for a longer time today than
usual and I was watching some stuff I

190
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:13,279
usual and I was watching some stuff I
 

191
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,310
usual and I was watching some stuff I
figured out how to connect my Bluetooth

192
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:16,320
figured out how to connect my Bluetooth
 

193
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,310
figured out how to connect my Bluetooth
headphones to my

194
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:18,320
headphones to my
 

195
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,310
headphones to my
PC so I was watching on my PC with the

196
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:21,320
PC so I was watching on my PC with the
 

197
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,949
PC so I was watching on my PC with the
Bluetooth headphones something while

198
00:09:22,949 --> 00:09:22,959
Bluetooth headphones something while
 

199
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,150
Bluetooth headphones something while
walking and running uh this way it was

200
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,160
walking and running uh this way it was
 

201
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,430
walking and running uh this way it was
not so [\h__\h] noisy and I could hear

202
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:28,440
not so [\h__\h] noisy and I could hear
 

203
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,590
not so [\h__\h] noisy and I could hear
clearly

204
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:30,600
clearly
 

205
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,550
clearly
but but the headphones also got a little

206
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:32,560
but but the headphones also got a little
 

207
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,470
but but the headphones also got a little
bit sweaty man because they're so thick

208
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:35,480
bit sweaty man because they're so thick
 

209
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,310
bit sweaty man because they're so thick
so now I think I finally under like

210
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:38,320
so now I think I finally under like
 

211
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,430
so now I think I finally under like
found one very very

212
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:41,440
found one very very
 

213
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,470
found one very very
reasonable reason of why you might want

214
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:44,480
reasonable reason of why you might want
 

215
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,670
reasonable reason of why you might want
to use

216
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:46,680
to use
 

217
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,509
to use
earbuds I get it when it comes to sports

218
00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:50,519
earbuds I get it when it comes to sports
 

219
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:54,110
earbuds I get it when it comes to sports
I definitely get it I do have a few like

220
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:54,120
I definitely get it I do have a few like
 

221
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,630
I definitely get it I do have a few like
two pairs or so from different makers I

222
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:57,640
two pairs or so from different makers I
 

223
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,790
two pairs or so from different makers I
might try that out next

224
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:00,800
might try that out next
 

225
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,949
might try that out next
of course I wiped I wiped the headphones

226
00:10:03,949 --> 00:10:03,959
of course I wiped I wiped the headphones
 

227
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:05,829
of course I wiped I wiped the headphones
afterwards but I noticed they they did

228
00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:05,839
afterwards but I noticed they they did
 

229
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,829
afterwards but I noticed they they did
get pretty

230
00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:09,839

 

231
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,710

sweaty um it's kind of hot so I'm going

232
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:13,720
sweaty um it's kind of hot so I'm going
 

233
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,949
sweaty um it's kind of hot so I'm going
to turn on I turned on the

234
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:16,959
to turn on I turned on the
 

235
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,350
to turn on I turned on the
fan I using Bluetooth earphones for

236
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:19,360
fan I using Bluetooth earphones for
 

237
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,230
fan I using Bluetooth earphones for
workout yeah makes

238
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:22,240
workout yeah makes
 

239
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,910
workout yeah makes
sense I'll buy those sweaty headphones

240
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:24,920
sense I'll buy those sweaty headphones
 

241
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,470
sense I'll buy those sweaty headphones
they the headphones themselves were

242
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:26,480
they the headphones themselves were
 

243
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,269
they the headphones themselves were
already pretty expensive so with my

244
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:28,279
already pretty expensive so with my
 

245
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:29,670
already pretty expensive so with my
sweat attached you know know it's going

246
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:29,680
sweat attached you know know it's going
 

247
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:36,790
sweat attached you know know it's going
to be very

248
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:36,800

 

249
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,550

expensive tissue paper between ears and

250
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:39,560
expensive tissue paper between ears and
 

251
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,910
expensive tissue paper between ears and
headphone that's just going to feel

252
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:40,920
headphone that's just going to feel
 

253
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,870
headphone that's just going to feel
weird

254
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:43,880

 

255
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,990

no have you played it or the others

256
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,000
no have you played it or the others
 

257
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,430
no have you played it or the others
before no I have not played any other

258
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:48,440
before no I have not played any other
 

259
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,470
before no I have not played any other
witch spring

260
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:51,480

 

261
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,430

games you blast my music at full power

262
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:55,440
games you blast my music at full power
 

263
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,030
games you blast my music at full power
nice yeah I I would do that too but my

264
00:10:59,030 --> 00:10:59,040
nice yeah I I would do that too but my
 

265
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,350
nice yeah I I would do that too but my
uh the little speakers that I have

266
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:01,360
uh the little speakers that I have
 

267
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,550
uh the little speakers that I have
normally I always use headphones at my

268
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:03,560
normally I always use headphones at my
 

269
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,790
normally I always use headphones at my
PC constantly it was just recently that

270
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:06,800
PC constantly it was just recently that
 

271
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,910
PC constantly it was just recently that
I finally attached uh uh speakers for

272
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:09,920
I finally attached uh uh speakers for
 

273
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,230
I finally attached uh uh speakers for
the first time but those speakers

274
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:11,240
the first time but those speakers
 

275
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,230
the first time but those speakers
they're really not that powerful I think

276
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:13,240
they're really not that powerful I think
 

277
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,269
they're really not that powerful I think
they're also kind of being throttled by

278
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:15,279
they're also kind of being throttled by
 

279
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,750
they're also kind of being throttled by
the broadcaster for some reason um but

280
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:17,760
the broadcaster for some reason um but
 

281
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,310
the broadcaster for some reason um but
it doesn't get that loud so when I have

282
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:19,320
it doesn't get that loud so when I have
 

283
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,150
it doesn't get that loud so when I have
the the fan and the running machine on

284
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:23,160
the the fan and the running machine on
 

285
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,550
the the fan and the running machine on
then yeah the speakers get a little bit

286
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:26,560
then yeah the speakers get a little bit
 

287
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,790
then yeah the speakers get a little bit
drowned out and it's hard to hear so

288
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:29,800
drowned out and it's hard to hear so
 

289
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,269
drowned out and it's hard to hear so
yeah that's why I like bone conduction

290
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:33,279
yeah that's why I like bone conduction
 

291
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,870
yeah that's why I like bone conduction
headphones for exercise they don't cover

292
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:34,880
headphones for exercise they don't cover
 

293
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,550
headphones for exercise they don't cover
your ears and get

294
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:36,560
your ears and get
 

295
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,590
your ears and get
sweaty or go in your ears bone

296
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:39,600
sweaty or go in your ears bone
 

297
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,230
sweaty or go in your ears bone
conduction ah you mean is

298
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:42,240
conduction ah you mean is
 

299
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:48,069
conduction ah you mean is
it is it those ah aha oh they go around

300
00:11:48,069 --> 00:11:48,079
it is it those ah aha oh they go around
 

301
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,150
it is it those ah aha oh they go around
the head in the back too I thought it

302
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:50,160
the head in the back too I thought it
 

303
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,550
the head in the back too I thought it
was

304
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:51,560
was
 

305
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,069
was
like H wait those are also B bone

306
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:54,079
like H wait those are also B bone
 

307
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,790
like H wait those are also B bone
conduction right the ones that don't

308
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:55,800
conduction right the ones that don't
 

309
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,509
conduction right the ones that don't
necessarily go around your head in the

310
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:57,519
necessarily go around your head in the
 

311
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,350
necessarily go around your head in the
back but just around your ear like in a

312
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:00,360
back but just around your ear like in a
 

313
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,350
back but just around your ear like in a
weird

314
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:02,360
weird
 

315
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,430
weird
shape those are both bone conduction I

316
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:05,440
shape those are both bone conduction I
 

317
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,150
shape those are both bone conduction I
guess not they have a weird name

318
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:08,160
guess not they have a weird name
 

319
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,389
guess not they have a weird name
man H I've tried these kind of uh

around the whole head in the back but
the ones that like you know they look

326
00:12:19,629 --> 00:12:19,639
the ones that like you know they look
 

327
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:22,870
the ones that like you know they look
like here let's let's show this the ones

328
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:22,880
like here let's let's show this the ones
 

329
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,590
like here let's let's show this the ones
that look like this I've tried before I

330
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:24,600
that look like this I've tried before I
 

331
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,230
that look like this I've tried before I
don't know why my app keeps on stopping

332
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:26,240
don't know why my app keeps on stopping
 

333
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,750
don't know why my app keeps on stopping
again today tried these before but

334
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:30,760
again today tried these before but
 

335
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,910
again today tried these before but
uh different brand but they were like it

336
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:33,920
uh different brand but they were like it
 

337
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,430
uh different brand but they were like it
was impossible to get them in or around

338
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:37,440
was impossible to get them in or around
 

339
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,590
was impossible to get them in or around
my ear it was like how the [\h__\h] does

340
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:39,600
my ear it was like how the [\h__\h] does
 

341
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:39,990
my ear it was like how the [\h__\h] does
this

342
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:40,000
this
 

343
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,230
this
[Laughter]

344
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:42,240
[Laughter]
 

345
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,949
[Laughter]

11270
05:47:08,110 --> 05:47:08,120
the weird light from my lamps so I
 

11271
05:47:08,120 --> 05:47:11,350
the weird light from my lamps so I
waited until the next day when there was

11272
05:47:11,350 --> 05:47:11,360
waited until the next day when there was
 

11273
05:47:11,360 --> 05:47:14,070
waited until the next day when there was
good light from outside and I was like

11274
05:47:14,070 --> 05:47:14,080
good light from outside and I was like
 

11275
05:47:14,080 --> 05:47:17,310
good light from outside and I was like
nope yep there are like weird

11276
05:47:17,310 --> 05:47:17,320
nope yep there are like weird
 

11277
05:47:17,320 --> 05:47:21,070
nope yep there are like weird
uneven areas where I can see the brush

11278
05:47:21,070 --> 05:47:21,080
uneven areas where I can see the brush
 

11279
05:47:21,080 --> 05:47:23,948
uneven areas where I can see the brush
strokes and stuff or the difference from

11280
05:47:23,948 --> 05:47:23,958
strokes and stuff or the difference from
 

11281
05:47:23,958 --> 05:47:26,310
strokes and stuff or the difference from
the edges that are made with a brush and

11282
05:47:26,310 --> 05:47:26,320
the edges that are made with a brush and
 

11283
05:47:26,320 --> 05:47:28,708
the edges that are made with a brush and
the big areas that are made with the the

11284
05:47:28,708 --> 05:47:28,718
the big areas that are made with the the
 

11285
05:47:28,718 --> 05:47:32,230
the big areas that are made with the the
roll thingy I was like damn it yeah I

11286
05:47:32,230 --> 05:47:32,240
roll thingy I was like damn it yeah I
 

11287
05:47:32,240 --> 05:47:34,788
roll thingy I was like damn it yeah I
think I have to fix this because it's

11288
05:47:34,788 --> 05:47:34,798
think I have to fix this because it's
 

11289
05:47:34,798 --> 05:47:39,110
think I have to fix this because it's
quite a lot of this so I tried on the

11290
05:47:39,110 --> 05:47:39,120
quite a lot of this so I tried on the
 

11291
05:47:39,120 --> 05:47:43,468
quite a lot of this so I tried on the
second day to like fix smaller things

11292
05:47:43,468 --> 05:47:43,478
second day to like fix smaller things
 

11293
05:47:43,478 --> 05:47:46,350
second day to like fix smaller things
and details but then partially I made it

11294
05:47:46,350 --> 05:47:46,360
and details but then partially I made it
 

11295
05:47:46,360 --> 05:47:49,468
and details but then partially I made it
kind of worse because I didn't realize

11296
05:47:49,468 --> 05:47:49,478
kind of worse because I didn't realize
 

11297
05:47:49,478 --> 05:47:52,110
kind of worse because I didn't realize
that you should do it with the spongy

11298
05:47:52,110 --> 05:47:52,120
that you should do it with the spongy
 

11299
05:47:52,120 --> 05:47:55,910
that you should do it with the spongy
roller not with the um brush I just

11300
05:47:55,910 --> 05:47:55,920
roller not with the um brush I just
 

11301
05:47:55,920 --> 05:47:58,190
roller not with the um brush I just
thought it's smaller area so I might as

11302
05:47:58,190 --> 05:47:58,200
thought it's smaller area so I might as
 

11303
05:47:58,200 --> 05:48:00,868
thought it's smaller area so I might as
well do it with a brush

11304
05:48:00,868 --> 05:48:00,878
well do it with a brush
 

11305
05:48:00,878 --> 05:48:05,990
well do it with a brush

H but after it dried and I really tried
 

11307
05:48:06,000 --> 05:48:08,310

my best it was a lot especially around

11308
05:48:08,310 --> 05:48:08,320
my best it was a lot especially around
 

11309
05:48:08,320 --> 05:48:10,948
my best it was a lot especially around
the edges where the tape was originally

11310
05:48:10,948 --> 05:48:10,958
the edges where the tape was originally
 

11311
05:48:10,958 --> 05:48:15,190
the edges where the tape was originally
I found so many like

11312
05:48:15,190 --> 05:48:15,200
I found so many like
 

11313
05:48:15,200 --> 05:48:20,310
I found so many like
little holes in the paint so to

11314
05:48:20,310 --> 05:48:20,320

 

11315
05:48:20,320 --> 05:48:23,270

say I was on it for hours and then even

11316
05:48:23,270 --> 05:48:23,280
say I was on it for hours and then even
 

11317
05:48:23,280 --> 05:48:25,750
say I was on it for hours and then even
after that after it all dried it still

11318
05:48:25,750 --> 05:48:25,760
after that after it all dried it still
 

11319
05:48:25,760 --> 05:48:29,548
after that after it all dried it still
looked like m not much

11320
05:48:29,548 --> 05:48:29,558

better yeah need some real skill yeah I
did some research and then watched some

11324
05:48:34,788 --> 05:48:34,798
did some research and then watched some
 

11325
05:48:34,798 --> 05:48:37,310
did some research and then watched some
painting videos from painting pros and

11326
05:48:37,310 --> 05:48:37,320
painting videos from painting pros and
 

11327
05:48:37,320 --> 05:48:40,270
painting videos from painting pros and
figured out ah okay you really need to

11328
05:48:40,270 --> 05:48:40,280
figured out ah okay you really need to
 

11329
05:48:40,280 --> 05:48:42,628
figured out ah okay you really need to
go over it with the

11330
05:48:42,628 --> 05:48:42,638
go over it with the
 

11331
05:48:42,638 --> 05:48:45,990
go over it with the
same uh like material that you used for

11332
05:48:45,990 --> 05:48:46,000
same uh like material that you used for
 

11333
05:48:46,000 --> 05:48:47,390
same uh like material that you used for
it originally because you're going to

11334
05:48:47,390 --> 05:48:47,400
it originally because you're going to
 

11335
05:48:47,400 --> 05:48:49,390
it originally because you're going to
see a difference

11336
05:48:49,390 --> 05:48:49,400
see a difference
 

11337
05:48:49,400 --> 05:48:53,468
see a difference
between uh the brush strokes and the

11338
05:48:53,468 --> 05:48:53,478
between uh the brush strokes and the
 

11339
05:48:53,478 --> 05:48:56,910
between uh the brush strokes and the
sponge like the texture is very

11340
05:48:56,910 --> 05:48:56,920
sponge like the texture is very
 

11341
05:48:56,920 --> 05:48:59,310
sponge like the texture is very
different I thought for touchups it's

11342
05:48:59,310 --> 05:48:59,320
different I thought for touchups it's
 

11343
05:48:59,320 --> 05:49:01,620
different I thought for touchups it's
going to be

11344
05:49:01,620 --> 05:49:01,630
going to be
