​​​ ​We're on the same team, A-chan?​ ​​

28
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:48,766
​​​ ​I choose Kiara's 17!​ ​​

00:00:46,397 --> 00:00:55,639

00:00:51,568 --> 00:00:55,639
​​​ ​The team with the most number​ ​​
​​ ​of correct matches wins.​ ​​

33
00:00:51,602 --> 00:00:55,639
​​​ ​You got it right...​ ​​

34
00:00:55,639 --> 00:01:00,911
​​​ ​We choose the other team's numbers,​ ​​
​​ ​not our own, correct?​ ​​

35
00:00:55,973 --> 00:01:02,212
​​​ ​Choose from the opposing team's panel.​ ​​

36
00:00:56,607 --> 00:00:57,408
​​​ ​Yes.​ ​​

37
00:01:00,911 --> 00:01:02,212
​​​ ​That's correct!​ ​​

38
00:01:02,212 --> 00:01:05,682
​​​ ​For our team,​ ​​
​​ ​we'll be choosing from your panel.​ ​​

39
00:01:05,682 --> 00:01:09,453
​​​ ​And for your team,​ ​​
​​ ​you'll be choosing from our panel.​ ​​

40
00:01:09,753 --> 00:01:12,456
​​​ ​AkiRose & Choco Team:​ ​​
​​ ​Choose Your Number!​ ​​

41
00:01:12,456 --> 00:01:13,323
​​​ ​First off,​ ​​

42
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:16,093
​​​ ​please choose a number.​ ​​

43
00:01:16,093 --> 00:01:18,996
​​​ ​Just tell us whose number​ ​​
​​ ​you're going for.​ ​​

44
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:22,566
​​​ ​Let's start with Kiara's 102.​ ​​

45
00:01:21,565 --> 00:01:23,934
​​​ ​102 is a pretty big number.​ ​​

46
00:01:23,934 --> 00:01:25,702
​​​ ​It'd be hilarious if it turned out​ ​​

47
00:01:25,702 --> 00:01:28,105
​​​ ​to be the number of​ ​​
​​ ​keyboards she's broken.​ ​​

48
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,105
​​​ ​That would be...​ ​​

49
00:01:28,105 --> 00:01:30,274
​​​ ​hard for keyboard sponsorships​ ​​
​​ ​to endorse...​ ​​

50
00:01:30,441 --> 00:01:32,509
​​​ ​Destruction to all keyboards!​ ​​

51
00:01:31,775 --> 00:01:33,110
​​​ ​* This is a bit​ ​​

52
00:01:33,277 --> 00:01:34,611
​​​ ​I have a pretty good guess.​ ​​

53
00:01:34,611 --> 00:01:35,746
​​​ ​That's quick.​ ​​

54
00:01:35,746 --> 00:01:39,583
​​​ ​I think you've taken a lot of pictures​ ​​
​​ ​since your last visit to Japan,​ ​​

55
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:43,287
​​​ ​so I'd say that's the number of​ ​​
​​ ​pictures you've taken this week.​ ​​

56
00:01:43,287 --> 00:01:47,558
​​​ ​She might have just been​ ​​
​​ ​shooting a panorama, to be fair.​ ​​

57
00:01:44,822 --> 00:01:46,557
​​​ ​Could be the case.​ ​​

58
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,558
​​<i>​ ​Click! Click! Click!​ ​</i>​

59
00:01:47,558 --> 00:01:50,327
​​​ ​Does that 102 refer to​ ​​

60
00:01:50,327 --> 00:01:54,231
​​​ ​the number of pictures​ ​​
​​ ​Kiara took this week...?​ ​​

61
00:01:54,832 --> 00:01:57,334
​​​ ​Ah! Yes it is!​ ​​

62
00:01:57,334 --> 00:01:58,836
​​​ ​That's correct!​ ​​

63
00:01:58,836 --> 00:02:01,138
​​​ ​I did an actual count,​ ​​

64
00:02:01,138 --> 00:02:02,139
​​​ ​and most of them​ ​​

65
00:02:02,139 --> 00:02:03,440
​​​ ​turned out to be cat pics.​ ​​

66
00:02:04,575 --> 00:02:08,345
​​​ ​We also have this week's​ ​​
​​ ​pic count of everyone else here.​ ​​

67
00:02:08,345 --> 00:02:10,581
​​​ ​Let's compare the numbers.​ ​​

68
00:02:10,581 --> 00:02:11,715
​​​ ​Here they are.​ ​​

69
00:02:10,781 --> 00:02:16,019
​​​ ​No. of pics taken this week​ ​​

70
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:14,685
​​​ ​For real?! Don't you guys take pics at all?​ ​​

71
00:02:12,516 --> 00:02:16,019
​​​ ​The gap is quite real.​ ​​

72
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:19,723
​​​ ​I think most of mine are all​ ​​

73
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:22,626
​​​ ​just pics of kitties.​ ​​

74
00:02:22,626 --> 00:02:24,928
​​​ ​Aren't you compelled to take even more?​ ​​

75
00:02:24,928 --> 00:02:28,499
​​​ ​The urge to touch them is just greater.​ ​​

76
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:27,965
​​​ ​Understandable.​ ​​

77
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,831
​​​ ​That's true...​ ​​

78
00:02:27,965 --> 00:02:29,566
​​​ ​That makes sense.​ ​​

79
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,869
​​​ ​I don't really take pictures that often.​ ​​

80
00:02:31,869 --> 00:02:35,873
​​​ ​I was asked to take​ ​​
​​ ​those ten pics of food.​ ​​

81
00:02:31,869 --> 00:02:37,975
​​​ ​Guess The Calorie​ ​​
​​ ​10 pics for a different show​ ​​

82
00:02:34,872 --> 00:02:36,840
​​​ ​It was a request...​ ​​

83
00:02:37,975 --> 00:02:41,044
​​​ ​What were those six pictures, A-chan?​ ​​

84
00:02:41,044 --> 00:02:45,816
​​​ ​I have this habit of taking​ ​​
​​ ​screenshots of notes I take down.​ ​​

85
00:02:41,044 --> 00:02:49,453
​​​ ​Actual screenshots​ ​​

86
00:02:45,816 --> 00:02:48,852
​​​ ​You truly are an office professional.​ ​​

87
00:02:46,984 --> 00:02:49,453
​​​ ​There's nothing wrong with that!​ ​​

88
00:02:49,653 --> 00:02:52,389
​​​ ​Anyway, congrats on your first point!​ ​​

89
00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:55,058
​​​ ​Hooray!​ ​​

90
00:02:52,656 --> 00:02:55,058

​​​ ​Kiara & Friend A Team:​ ​​
​​ ​Choose Your Number!​ ​​

92
00:02:58,061 --> 00:03:02,332
​​​ ​Instead of starting with a number,​ ​​

93
00:03:02,332 --> 00:03:05,702
​​​ ​why don't we start with the phrases?​ ​​

94
00:03:03,467 --> 00:03:06,470
​​​ ​You wanna start with those?​ ​​

95
00:03:05,702 --> 00:03:06,937
​​​ ​Yeah.​ ​​

96
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:08,906
​​​ ​Which is an easy pick?​ ​​

97
00:03:08,906 --> 00:03:11,708
​​​ ​I've been to Choco-sensei's home.​ ​​

98
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,844
​​​ ​She has a ton of clothes.​ ​​

99
00:03:14,811 --> 00:03:16,146
​​​ ​Wanna go with that?​ ​​

100
00:03:16,413 --> 00:03:18,749
​​​ ​I don't want to make that call...​ ​​

101
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,685
​​​ ​150 is the number of clothes​ ​​

102
00:03:21,685 --> 00:03:24,488
​​​ ​Choco has at home!​ ​​

103
00:03:25,656 --> 00:03:28,825
​​​ ​Whoa! I got it!​ ​​

104
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:30,727
​​​ ​Ah darn, she got it right!​ ​​

105
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:30,727
​​​ ​Thank goodness!​ ​​

106
00:03:30,727 --> 00:03:34,031
​​​ ​I think I spend the most​ ​​
​​ ​on clothes in general.​ ​​

107
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:35,632
​​​ ​They are cute, to be fair.​ ​​

108
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:36,967
​​​ ​I have a lot of dresses.​ ​​

109
00:03:36,266 --> 00:03:37,801
​​​ ​Yep.​ ​​

110
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:40,704
​​​ ​Especially those with back zippers.​ ​​

111
00:03:39,203 --> 00:03:40,704
​​​ ​Right.​ ​​

112
00:03:41,004 --> 00:03:43,874
​​​ ​We got everyone's numbers too.​ ​​

113
00:03:43,874 --> 00:03:45,943
​​​ ​Let's take a look.​ ​​

114
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:45,943
​​​ ​Yours is probably low, A-chan.​ ​​

115
00:03:45,943 --> 00:03:47,211
​​​ ​Here they are!​ ​​

116
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:50,881
​​​ ​No. of clothes​ ​​

117
00:03:49,046 --> 00:03:50,881
​​​ ​Kiara-san has over a hundred.​ ​​

118
00:03:50,881 --> 00:03:53,750
​​​ ​They are too many to count,​ ​​

119
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,219
​​​ ​so it's just a rough average.​ ​​

120
00:03:55,586 --> 00:03:58,355
​​​ ​Aki-senpai and A-chan​ ​​
​​ ​have too few though!​ ​​

121
00:03:58,355 --> 00:04:00,090
​​​ ​I keep things real simple.​ ​​

122
00:04:00,591 --> 00:04:03,527
​​​ ​I carry four of the same variety.​ ​​

123
00:04:03,527 --> 00:04:05,362
​​​ ​Just like Steve Jobs!​ ​​

124
00:04:04,728 --> 00:04:05,362
​​​ ​Exactly!​ ​​

125
00:04:05,362 --> 00:04:08,131
​​​ ​I have four pairs of the same style,​ ​​

126
00:04:08,131 --> 00:04:12,135
​​​ ​which are then further split into seasons.​ ​​

127
00:04:12,135 --> 00:04:13,804
​​​ ​So that's at least 32 articles of clothing.​ ​​

128
00:04:13,804 --> 00:04:14,771
​​​ ​Today I learned​ ​​

129
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:18,242
​​​ ​Steve Jobs​ ​​
​​ ​Style​ ​​

130
00:04:14,771 --> 00:04:17,674
​​​ ​that people like that do exist. Wow.​ ​​

131
00:04:16,573 --> 00:04:17,474
​​​ ​We do.​ ​​

132
00:04:18,242 --> 00:04:20,310
​​​ ​Aki-san had fewer than I thought.​ ​​

133
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,479
​​​ ​I thought you had dance clothes.​ ​​

134
00:04:22,746 --> 00:04:27,017
​​​ ​I didn't add those into the count.​ ​​

135
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:27,517
​​​ ​So it'd be a bigger count​ ​​
​​ ​if you added them in?​ ​​

136
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:30,087
​​​ ​I think I have about 50 dance clothes.​ ​​

137
00:04:27,551 --> 00:04:30,087
​​​ ​Casual wear​ ​​

138
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:30,087
​​​ ​Dance wear​ ​​

139
00:04:30,454 --> 00:04:34,925
​​​ ​Aki-san, don't leave me behind!​ ​​

140
00:04:32,489 --> 00:04:33,657
​​​ ​Sorry, A-chan.​ ​​

141
00:04:33,657 --> 00:04:35,292
​​​ ​I'm just different.​ ​​

142
00:04:35,592 --> 00:04:38,295
​​​ ​AkiRose & Choco Team:​ ​​
​​ ​Choose Your Number!​ ​​

143
00:04:38,295 --> 00:04:42,666
​​​ ​I'd like to guess what Friend A's 0 is.​ ​​

144
00:04:42,132 --> 00:04:43,400
​​​ ​Zero, huh.​ ​​

145
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,504
​​​ ​You have both socks and mirrors​ ​​
​​ ​in your washroom so those aren't zero.​ ​​

146
00:04:47,504 --> 00:04:49,773
​​​ ​I think I've got it, Choco-sensei!​ ​​

147
00:04:49,773 --> 00:04:50,974
​​​ ​Give your answer!​ ​​

148
00:04:50,974 --> 00:04:53,910
​​​ ​I've heard her say she doesn't own a cat,​ ​​

149
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,480
​​​ ​so she doesn't have any cat litter, right?​ ​​

150
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,948
​​​ ​You make a good point.​ ​​

151
00:04:57,948 --> 00:05:00,083
​​​ ​A-chan. A-chan!​ ​​

152
00:04:58,815 --> 00:05:00,083
​​​ ​You're whistling...​ ​​

153
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,519
​​​ ​Your reaction makes it way too obvious!​ ​​

154
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:04,154
​​​ ​I'm sorry, Kiara-san!​ ​​

155
00:05:04,154 --> 00:05:06,690
​​​ ​Anyway, so is Friend A's 0​ ​​

156
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:09,026
​​​ ​the amount of cat litter in her house?​ ​​

157
00:05:10,027 --> 00:05:12,996
​​​ ​Yes! That is correct!​ ​​

158
00:05:11,962 --> 00:05:13,730
​​​ ​Yay!​ ​​

159
00:05:13,997 --> 00:05:17,334
​​​ ​I can't keep cats at my current place.​ ​​

160
00:05:17,334 --> 00:05:19,736
​​​ ​I'd want to have one once I move out.​ ​​

161
00:05:20,137 --> 00:05:22,606
​​​ ​Let's see everyone else's numbers.​ ​​

162
00:05:22,606 --> 00:05:30,247
​​​ ​No. of cat litter at home​ ​​

163
00:05:23,173 --> 00:05:30,247
​​​ ​grains​ ​​

164
00:05:23,173 --> 00:05:30,247
​​​ ​bags​ ​​

165
00:05:23,173 --> 00:05:30,247
​​​ ​liters​ ​​

166
00:05:23,974 --> 00:05:25,475
​​​ ​The counters are different?!​ ​​

167
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:30,247
​​​ ​I have a few questions about​ ​​
​​ ​these highly specific counters, but...​ ​​

168
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:31,982
​​​ ​Choco-sensei,​ ​​
​​ ​by pieces you mean bags?​ ​​

169
00:05:31,982 --> 00:05:33,417
​​​ ​Like 2 bags of cat litter.​ ​​

170
00:05:32,849 --> 00:05:33,417
​​​ ​Yep.​ ​​

171
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:34,851
​​​ ​Kiara-san's in <i>liters</i>?!​ ​​

172
00:05:34,851 --> 00:05:36,119
​​​ ​That's how it was.​ ​​

173
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:38,555
​​​ ​I ordered them from Am*zon,​ ​​
​​ ​and they were pretty heavy.​ ​​

174
00:05:38,555 --> 00:05:39,890
​​​ ​The box said "liters."​ ​​

175
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:43,593
​​​ ​One package was about 10 liters.​ ​​

176
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,428
​​​ ​So that's how it was.​ ​​

177
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:46,096
​​​ ​I have a lot, yes.​ ​​

178
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:47,931
​​​ ​I see.​ ​​

179
00:05:46,997 --> 00:05:47,931
​​​ ​I get you.​ ​​

180
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:50,133
​​​ ​Aki-san, did you actually​ ​​
​​ ​count 10,000 of the grains?​ ​​

181
00:05:50,801 --> 00:05:52,235
​​​ ​How did you...?​ ​​

182
00:05:52,235 --> 00:05:55,238
​​​ ​I think I have around​ ​​
​​ ​10,000 of them grains.​ ​​

183
00:05:54,538 --> 00:05:56,006
​​​ ​Are you sure?​ ​​

184
00:05:55,238 --> 00:05:56,807
​​​ ​How could you know?!​ ​​

185
00:05:56,807 --> 00:05:59,176
​​​ ​She probably let​ ​​
​​ ​her muscles do the counting.​ ​​

186
00:05:59,176 --> 00:06:01,611
​​​ ​Swolenthal counted 10,000.​ ​​

187
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,380
​​​ ​That's another point for your team.​ ​​

188
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:06,183
​​​ ​Congratulations!​ ​​

189
00:06:06,183 --> 00:06:07,818
​​​ ​Yay!​ ​​

190
00:06:08,085 --> 00:06:11,121
​​​ ​Act ignorant next time, got it?​ ​​

191
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,587
​​​ ​Sorry!​ ​​

192
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,189
​​​ ​I'll try!​ ​​

193
00:06:12,489 --> 00:06:15,192
​​​ ​Kiara & Friend A Team:​ ​​
​​ ​Choose Your Number!​ ​​

194
00:06:15,192 --> 00:06:17,494
​​​ ​Let's take another swing at it.​ ​​

195
00:06:17,494 --> 00:06:18,862
​​​ ​We're gonna catch up!​ ​​

196
00:06:18,862 --> 00:06:19,563
​​​ ​This one.​ ​​

197
00:06:19,563 --> 00:06:22,733
​​​ ​This 7.9 has me curious.​ ​​

198
00:06:22,733 --> 00:06:27,371
​​​ ​Time records for 50-meter sprints​ ​​
​​ ​have decimal places, right?​ ​​

199
00:06:27,371 --> 00:06:30,006
​​​ ​I have no clue how fast​ ​​

200
00:06:30,006 --> 00:06:32,042
​​​ ​that is, to be honest.​ ​​

201
00:06:31,575 --> 00:06:34,511
​​​ ​It's below 8 seconds, at least.​ ​​

202
00:06:34,511 --> 00:06:38,315
​​​ ​We're good, then. Let's go with that.​ ​​

203
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:38,315
​​​ ​Let's lock it in.​ ​​

204
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:39,750
​​​ ​AkiRose's 7.9​ ​​

205
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:43,487
​​​ ​refers to her time in a 50-meter sprint!​ ​​

206
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:45,155
​​​ ​Please be it!​ ​​

207
00:06:45,756 --> 00:06:49,359
​​​ ​We got it!​ ​​

208
00:06:46,857 --> 00:06:49,359
​​​ ​Oh my god!​ ​​

209
00:06:49,726 --> 00:06:52,796
​​​ ​Let's compare it with everyone's times.​ ​​

210
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,330
​​​ ​Alright.​ ​​

211
00:06:52,796 --> 00:06:56,066
​​​ ​50-meter sprint record​ ​​

212
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:56,066
​​​ ​Don't remember​ ​​

213
00:06:53,697 --> 00:06:54,931
​​​ ​You don't remember...​ ​​

214
00:06:56,066 --> 00:06:58,168
​​​ ​You're pretty fast, Aki-san.​ ​​

215
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:01,705
​​​ ​That was me at my prime.​ ​​

216
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:04,341
​​​ ​We don't really test for it now, do we?​ ​​

217
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:05,208
​​​ ​Did you guys​ ​​

218
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,210
​​​ ​record your times back at school?​ ​​

219
00:07:06,543 --> 00:07:08,311
​​​ ​Yep, we did.​ ​​

220
00:07:08,745 --> 00:07:11,081
​​​ ​What do you do with it?​ ​​

221
00:07:11,081 --> 00:07:14,584
​​​ ​I think we use it to set​ ​​
​​ ​the order in relay races,​ ​​

222
00:07:14,584 --> 00:07:16,486
​​​ ​choosing the fastest runners.​ ​​

223
00:07:16,486 --> 00:07:18,054
​​​ ​What about you, A-chan?​ ​​

224
00:07:18,054 --> 00:07:20,657
​​​ ​This was a pretty recent record,​ ​​
​​ ​so it's quite slow.​ ​​

225
00:07:21,892 --> 00:07:24,728
​​​ ​I think I was faster back​ ​​
​​ ​when I played soccer.​ ​​

226
00:07:24,728 --> 00:07:26,630
​​​ ​You played soccer?!​ ​​

227
00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:27,597
​​​ ​I did!​ ​​

228
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:30,734
​​​ ​We're learning so much about A-chan...​ ​​

229
00:07:29,566 --> 00:07:31,034
​​​ ​Unexpected, right?​ ​​

230
00:07:31,334 --> 00:07:34,037
​​​ ​AkiRose & Choco Team:​ ​​
​​ ​Choose Your Number!​ ​​

231
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:36,306
​​​ ​Friend A's 20...​ ​​

232
00:07:36,306 --> 00:07:39,609
​​​ ​has to be the number of socks she has.​ ​​

233
00:07:39,609 --> 00:07:43,146
​​​ ​Five-day work week,​ ​​

234
00:07:39,676 --> 00:07:44,681
​​​ ​5 days x 4 pairs = 20 socks?​ ​​

235
00:07:43,146 --> 00:07:44,681
​​​ ​which means she goes out​ ​​
​​ ​five times a week.​ ​​

236
00:07:44,681 --> 00:07:47,751
​​​ ​Going from how she described​ ​​
​​ ​her clothing habits,​ ​​

237
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:49,619
​​​ ​Steve Jobs Style: Revisited​ ​​

238
00:07:47,751 --> 00:07:49,619
​​​ ​I'd say this hypothesis holds, Aki-sama.​ ​​

239
00:07:49,619 --> 00:07:50,387
​​​ ​The hints have been​ ​​

240
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:53,290
​​​ ​pretty obvious all throughout.​ ​​

241
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:54,291
​​​ ​Time! Time out!​ ​​

242
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,459
​​​ ​We should go with this.​ ​​

243
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:57,260
​​​ ​I agree.​ ​​

244
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:57,928
​​​ ​Let's go!​ ​​

245
00:07:57,928 --> 00:07:59,729
​​​ ​Is Friend A's 20​ ​​

246
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,832
​​​ ​the number of socks she has?​ ​​

247
00:08:01,832 --> 00:08:03,567
​​​ ​Please no...​ ​​

248
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:06,470
​​​ ​That is correct!​ ​​

249
00:08:08,138 --> 00:08:11,441
​​​ ​You're too easy, A-chan!​ ​​

250
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:12,209
​​​ ​So easy!​ ​​

251
00:08:12,209 --> 00:08:14,377
​​​ ​Let's check out everyone else's numbers.​ ​​

252
00:08:14,377 --> 00:08:17,180
​​​ ​No. of socks​ ​​

253
00:08:15,278 --> 00:08:17,180
​​​ ​We all have a lot of socks!​ ​​

254
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,482
​​​ ​We match!​ ​​

255
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,182
​​​ ​We do match.​ ​​

256
00:08:19,182 --> 00:08:21,017
​​​ ​Aki-san! Choco-sensei!​ ​​

257
00:08:21,017 --> 00:08:22,586
​​​ ​Why so few socks?!​ ​​

258
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:24,721
​​​ ​I don't go out much.​ ​​

259
00:08:24,721 --> 00:08:28,225
​​​ ​I'm more of a barefoot person.​ ​​

260
00:08:25,722 --> 00:08:28,225
​​​ ​Team Barefoot​ ​​

261
00:08:28,225 --> 00:08:29,125
​​​ ​So you see,​ ​​

262
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:32,562
​​​ ​I only have one kind for all pairs.​ ​​

263
00:08:32,562 --> 00:08:34,931
​​​ ​They're all short black socks.​ ​​

264
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:38,168
​​​ ​I recommend it! Lose one,​ ​​
​​ ​and you just swap for another!​ ​​

265
00:08:38,168 --> 00:08:39,369
​​​ ​I mean, that's true, but...​ ​​

266
00:08:39,369 --> 00:08:40,937
​​​ ​You have a point, but...​ ​​

267
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,405
​​​ ​No buts!​ ​​

268
00:08:42,405 --> 00:08:44,774
​​​ ​Don't judge me, please!​ ​​

269
00:08:45,075 --> 00:08:47,777
​​​ ​Kiara & Friend A Team:​ ​​
​​ ​Choose Your Number!​ ​​

270
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:51,147
​​​ ​I wonder what Choco-sensei's 0 is?​ ​​

271
00:08:51,147 --> 00:08:54,084
​​​ ​Maybe it's the number of times​ ​​
​​ ​she soaks in the tub?​ ​​

272
00:08:54,084 --> 00:08:56,620
​​​ ​If she's a shower person,​ ​​
​​ ​then it makes sense.​ ​​

273
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,455
​​​ ​Are there Japanese people like that?​ ​​

274
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:01,057
​​​ ​I mean,​ ​​
​​ ​Chloe-san doesn't even take baths.​ ​​

275
00:09:01,825 --> 00:09:02,826
​​​ ​True.​ ​​

276
00:09:02,826 --> 00:09:05,028
​​​ ​Erm, hold on.​ ​​

277
00:09:05,028 --> 00:09:07,797
​​​ ​I don't vibe with this. Let's change it.​ ​​

278
00:09:06,363 --> 00:09:09,699
​​​ ​Sure, sure. Denied so cleanly, huh.​ ​​

279
00:09:07,097 --> 00:09:09,699
​​​ ​Not her vibe.​ ​​

280
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:13,770
​​​ ​Both Choco-sensei and Aki-senpai​ ​​

281
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:15,772
​​​ ​usually cook their own meals,​ ​​

282
00:09:15,772 --> 00:09:19,543
​​​ ​so I wonder if they ever order delivery.​ ​​

283
00:09:17,374 --> 00:09:19,543
​​​ ​That's a really good question!​ ​​

284
00:09:19,543 --> 00:09:22,612
​​​ ​I get the impression​ ​​
​​ ​that they don't often do it.​ ​​

285
00:09:22,612 --> 00:09:26,283
​​​ ​Maybe Aki-san is a frequent user?​ ​​

286
00:09:26,283 --> 00:09:27,584
​​​ ​Maybe?​ ​​

287
00:09:27,584 --> 00:09:29,252
​​​ ​Take a guess.​ ​​

288
00:09:29,252 --> 00:09:30,854
​​​ ​No, we're digging in!​ ​​

289
00:09:30,854 --> 00:09:33,456
​​​ ​That 7 is for number of food deliveries!​ ​​

290
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:33,456
​​​ ​Okay!​ ​​

291
00:09:33,456 --> 00:09:35,992
​​​ ​Is AkiRose's 7​ ​​

292
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:39,796
​​​ ​the number of food deliveries​ ​​
​​ ​she had this week?​ ​​

293
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,867
​​​ ​Yay! We got it!​ ​​

294
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:46,436
​​​ ​No way! Really?!​ ​​

295
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:46,436
​​​ ​We got it right.​ ​​

296
00:09:46,636 --> 00:09:50,707
​​​ ​I just moved in to a new place, so...​ ​​

297
00:09:49,239 --> 00:09:50,707
​​​ ​That explains it!​ ​​

298
00:09:50,707 --> 00:09:55,879
​​​ ​The only choices I had were eating out,​ ​​
​​ ​take-out, or food delivery.​ ​​

299
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:57,180
​​​ ​She just moved in, so the kitchen was​ ​​
​​ ​still unusable. Had to order delivery.​ ​​

300
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:01,284
​​​ ​I kept it at one delivery a day!​ ​​

301
00:09:59,716 --> 00:10:01,284
​​​ ​Makes sense.​ ​​

302
00:10:01,284 --> 00:10:03,954
​​​ ​Let's see how much the others ordered.​ ​​

303
00:10:03,954 --> 00:10:05,055
​​​ ​Reveal it.​ ​​

304
00:10:04,821 --> 00:10:09,926
​​​ ​No. of food deliveries ordered this week​ ​​

305
00:10:05,488 --> 00:10:08,892
​​​ ​I... got kebabs, yeah.​ ​​

306
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:09,926
​​​ ​(kebab)​ ​​

307
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,059
​​​ ​Kebab...​ ​​

308
00:10:09,926 --> 00:10:12,095
​​​ ​That's less than I thought,​ ​​
​​ ​Choco-sensei.​ ​​

309
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,497
​​​ ​I've been eating out lately.​ ​​

310
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:16,900
​​​ ​Eating on the move and stuff.​ ​​

311
00:10:15,832 --> 00:10:17,834
​​​ ​You mentioned that.​ ​​

312
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,803
​​​ ​That's how I've been this week.​ ​​

313
00:10:19,803 --> 00:10:22,105
​​​ ​I'm surprised you're at 0, Kiara-san.​ ​​

314
00:10:22,105 --> 00:10:23,473
​​​ ​Unlike Japan,​ ​​

315
00:10:23,473 --> 00:10:27,644
​​​ ​Austria's delivery services​ ​​
​​ ​get very expensive.​ ​​

316
00:10:26,409 --> 00:10:28,278
​​​ ​Oh, really?​ ​​

317
00:10:28,278 --> 00:10:29,245
​​​ ​I also feel like​ ​​

318
00:10:29,245 --> 00:10:33,216
​​​ ​I keep ordering the same stuff,​ ​​

319
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:36,586
​​​ ​so I've been cooking​ ​​
​​ ​at home more instead.​ ​​

320
00:10:33,283 --> 00:10:36,586
​​​ ​Cooking more at home​ ​​

321
00:10:36,586 --> 00:10:39,155
​​​ ​Did you really want that kebab, A-chan?​ ​​

322
00:10:39,155 --> 00:10:41,024
​​​ ​I've been on a kebab habit lately.​ ​​

323
00:10:41,024 --> 00:10:44,227
​​​ ​I crave it twice a week.​ ​​

324
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,196
​​​ ​Drizzle it with that super spicy sauce.​ ​​

325
00:10:44,995 --> 00:10:46,696
​​​ ​Delicious, ain't it?​ ​​

326
00:10:46,196 --> 00:10:47,430
​​​ ​Yep!​ ​​

327
00:10:46,696 --> 00:10:48,131
​​​ ​It's very good.​ ​​

​​​ ​Two-Person Coop!​ ​​
​​ ​Private Number Quiz!​ ​​

329
00:10:51,134 --> 00:10:53,770
​​​ ​Man, we had an intense match!​ ​​

330
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:58,575
​​​ ​We're not yet sure who will win.​ ​​

331
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:58,575
​​​ ​AkiRose & Choco Team​ ​​
​​ ​3 Points​ ​​

332
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:58,575
​​​ ​Kiara & Friend A Team​ ​​
​​ ​3 Points​ ​​

333
00:10:57,474 --> 00:10:58,575
​​​ ​But...?​ ​​

334
00:10:58,575 --> 00:10:59,809
​​​ ​We're done!​ ​​

335
00:10:59,809 --> 00:11:01,344
​​​ ​Game over! Bye, guys!​ ​​

336
00:11:00,877 --> 00:11:03,046
​​​ ​What?!​ ​​

337
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,146
​​​ ​Pack it up!​ ​​

338
00:11:02,712 --> 00:11:03,480
​​​ ​For real?!​ ​​

339
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,816
​​​ ​We had too much fun talking,​ ​​
​​ ​so now we're out of time.​ ​​

340
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,619
​​​ ​I wanna know the rest!​ ​​

341
00:11:09,619 --> 00:11:10,453
​​​ ​Okay, then.​ ​​

342
00:11:10,453 --> 00:11:12,088
​​​ ​Any numbers​ ​​
​​ ​you'd like to check, Aki-san?​ ​​

343
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:17,093
​​​ ​What was Kiara's 7?​ ​​

344
00:11:15,325 --> 00:11:17,661
​​​ ​Kiara's 7? Let's see...​ ​​

345
00:11:17,661 --> 00:11:19,229
​​​ ​Here it is.​ ​​

346
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:23,433
​​​ ​No. of mirrors at home​ ​​

347
00:11:20,163 --> 00:11:23,433
​​​ ​It's the number of mirrors​ ​​
​​ ​in her home! She has a lot!​ ​​

348
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,669
​​​ ​I don't count the small ones.​ ​​

349
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:27,837
​​​ ​Her home has a lot of rooms,​ ​​
​​ ​each with mirrors.​ ​​

350
00:11:25,669 --> 00:11:27,837
​​​ ​Only the big ones,​ ​​
​​ ​since I have a lot of rooms with them.​ ​​

351
00:11:28,171 --> 00:11:30,040
​​​ ​Choco-sensei only has two?​ ​​

352
00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:31,241
​​​ ​That's surprisingly few.​ ​​

353
00:11:31,841 --> 00:11:33,276
​​​ ​One in the washroom, one in the bath.​ ​​

354
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:35,578
​​​ ​You don't have a full body mirror?​ ​​

355
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:37,047
​​​ ​Oh, does that count?​ ​​

356
00:11:37,047 --> 00:11:38,648
​​​ ​Yes, it should.​ ​​

357
00:11:38,648 --> 00:11:39,516
​​​ ​Yes!​ ​​

358
00:11:39,983 --> 00:11:41,384
​​​ ​And Aki-san has five.​ ​​

359
00:11:41,384 --> 00:11:43,019
​​​ ​They're for dance use.​ ​​

360
00:11:42,185 --> 00:11:43,520
​​​ ​Oh right.​ ​​

361
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:47,590
​​​ ​I have three 180 x 100 cm​ ​​
​​ ​mirrors just lined up.​ ​​

362
00:11:45,522 --> 00:11:47,590
​​​ ​They're pretty big.​ ​​

363
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:48,858
​​​ ​Wow.​ ​​

364
00:11:48,858 --> 00:11:50,360
​​​ ​I wanna know what​ ​​
​​ ​Choco-sensei's 0 is.​ ​​

365
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,429
​​​ ​Choco-sensei's 0? Here it is.​ ​​

366
00:11:52,262 --> 00:11:57,133
​​​ ​Time taken soaking​ ​​
​​ ​in the bath in seconds​ ​​

367
00:11:53,563 --> 00:11:57,133
​​​ ​Bathing time!​ ​​

368
00:11:57,434 --> 00:11:59,269
​​​ ​I don't soak in the bath.​ ​​

369
00:11:59,269 --> 00:11:59,969
​​​ ​Really?!​ ​​

370
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,571
​​​ ​I just shower.​ ​​

371
00:12:00,336 --> 00:12:03,406
​​​ ​I knew it!​ ​​

372
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,275
​​​ ​I'm shocked at how I take the longest.​ ​​

373
00:12:05,275 --> 00:12:06,943
​​​ ​What do you do to take that long?!​ ​​

374
00:12:06,943 --> 00:12:10,480
​​​ ​I watch YouTube in that entire hour.​ ​​

375
00:12:09,746 --> 00:12:15,118
​​​ ​No work. Watch Youtube.​ ​​

376
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,118
​​​ ​I take that entire time as my break time.​ ​​

377
00:12:10,547 --> 00:12:11,948
​​​ ​Guessed it.​ ​​

378
00:12:15,118 --> 00:12:18,521
​​​ ​It's good you find time to relax.​ ​​

379
00:12:18,788 --> 00:12:21,191
​​​ ​Which do you wanna check?​ ​​

380
00:12:21,191 --> 00:12:23,326
​​​ ​Friend A's 3.​ ​​

381
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:24,694
​​​ ​What was that again?​ ​​

382
00:12:24,694 --> 00:12:26,463
​​​ ​Let's check.​ ​​

383
00:12:25,795 --> 00:12:32,535
​​​ ​No. of keyboards broken​ ​​

384
00:12:26,463 --> 00:12:27,831
​​​ ​Wait, huh?​ ​​

385
00:12:27,797 --> 00:12:29,399
​​​ ​Keyboards?!​ ​​

386
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:28,798
​​​ ​I have the most?​ ​​

387
00:12:29,599 --> 00:12:31,401
​​​ ​How did you break them?!​ ​​

388
00:12:30,533 --> 00:12:32,535
​​​ ​That's not a lot.​ ​​

389
00:12:30,867 --> 00:12:31,768
​​​ ​For real?!​ ​​

390
00:12:32,535 --> 00:12:34,504
​​​ ​I've never broken one.​ ​​

391
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:34,504
​​​ ​What?!​ ​​

392
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:35,405
​​​ ​Really?​ ​​

393
00:12:34,537 --> 00:12:35,405
​​​ ​Same here.​ ​​

394
00:12:35,405 --> 00:12:39,709
​​​ ​Don't they break eventually?​ ​​
​​ ​Like when a key falls off.​ ​​

395
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:41,111
​​​ ​Never.​ ​​

396
00:12:40,376 --> 00:12:41,111
​​​ ​Wha?!​ ​​

397
00:12:41,644 --> 00:12:42,812
​​​ ​Haven't had that happen.​ ​​

398
00:12:42,812 --> 00:12:46,082
​​​ ​Do you press too hard?​ ​​

399
00:12:45,448 --> 00:12:46,916
​​​ ​Keyboard smash!​ ​​

400
00:12:47,117 --> 00:12:49,352
​​​ ​Let's go for the last one.​ ​​

401
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,154
​​​ ​Aki-san's 30.​ ​​

402
00:12:51,154 --> 00:12:54,290
​​​ ​I wonder what is it?​ ​​

403
00:12:53,256 --> 00:12:54,290
​​​ ​Is it...​ ​​

404
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,125
​​​ ​Here it is.​ ​​

405
00:12:54,824 --> 00:13:02,699
​​​ ​No. of push-ups in one go​ ​​

406
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,762
​​​ ​It's push-ups, wow!​ ​​

407
00:12:58,762 --> 00:13:02,699
​​​ ​Those are low numbers for​ ​​
​​ ​Choco-sensei and Kiara-san...​ ​​

408
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:06,903
​​​ ​This number assumes​ ​​
​​ ​I can do push-ups.​ ​​

409
00:13:06,903 --> 00:13:08,738
​​​ ​The number is actually lower.​ ​​

410
00:13:08,738 --> 00:13:10,039
​​​ ​My viewers always say​ ​​

411
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,475
​​​ ​I have noodle arms.​ ​​

412
00:13:12,475 --> 00:13:14,177
​​​ ​That's how weak I am.​ ​​

413
00:13:14,177 --> 00:13:16,179
​​​ ​I might actually be too weak to live.​ ​​

414
00:13:16,179 --> 00:13:19,382
​​​ ​Do you practice doing​ ​​
​​ ​push-ups, Aki-senpai?​ ​​

415
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:22,318
​​​ ​I have done much lately.​ ​​

416
00:13:22,318 --> 00:13:26,256
​​​ ​Core exercises x30​ ​​

417
00:13:22,352 --> 00:13:25,655
​​​ ​I did core exercises​ ​​

418
00:13:25,655 --> 00:13:29,559
​​​ ​every day for around 3-4 years​ ​​

419
00:13:26,256 --> 00:13:29,959
​​​ ​3 years x 365 days​ ​​

420
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:33,029
​​​ ​every morning and evening.​ ​​

421
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:33,029
​​​ ​Day and night (x2)​ ​​

422
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,029
​​​ ​You are a dancer, after all.​ ​​

423
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:35,365
​​​ ​So inspiring!​ ​​

424
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:35,999
​​​ ​Hehe!​ ​​

425
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,568
​​​ ​With all that wrapped up,​ ​​

426
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:41,171
​​​ ​it was fun seeing everyone's info!​ ​​

427
00:13:41,171 --> 00:13:42,839
​​​ ​For a quiz challenge,​ ​​

428
00:13:41,171 --> 00:13:54,417
​​​ ​Subscribe to the hololive official​ ​​
​​ ​& our guests' channels!​ ​​

429
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:46,409
​​​ ​A-chan gave out too many hints.​ ​​

430
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:46,176
​​​ ​Right?​ ​​

431
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:50,146
​​​ ​It was too easy.​ ​​

432
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:50,146
​​​ ​Darn it, they see right through me!​ ​​

433
00:13:50,146 --> 00:13:52,115
​​​ ​I'm sorry for being an open book!​ ​​

434
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:53,149
​​​ ​No denying that.​ ​​

435
00:13:52,115 --> 00:13:54,417
​​​ ​Pretty much.​ ​​
