there will be a segment for Holiday

168
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:33,780
there will be a segment for Holiday
 

169
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,830
there will be a segment for Holiday
members and non-allife members because I

170
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:36,840
members and non-allife members because I
 

171
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,930
members and non-allife members because I
think it's going to be easier for me to

172
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:38,940
think it's going to be easier for me to
 

173
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,930
think it's going to be easier for me to
list them off as much as I want to mix

174
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:41,940
list them off as much as I want to mix
 

175
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,629
list them off as much as I want to mix
them like the holiday members with my

176
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:44,639
them like the holiday members with my
 

177
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,150
them like the holiday members with my
non-hollow friends it'll be a little bit

178
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:47,160
non-hollow friends it'll be a little bit
 

179
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,390
non-hollow friends it'll be a little bit
hard to keep track of all of the videos

180
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:49,400
hard to keep track of all of the videos
 

181
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,490
hard to keep track of all of the videos
so yeah I'll be dividing them into two

182
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:52,500
so yeah I'll be dividing them into two
 

183
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,770
so yeah I'll be dividing them into two
but don't worry
