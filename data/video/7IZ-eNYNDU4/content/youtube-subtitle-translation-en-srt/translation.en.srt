00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:33,969
like that all the time.  I
 

123
00:04:33,969 --> 00:04:37,559
like that all the time.  I
was at the bottom of the class, but being able to become

00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:41,460
that dango means that you've gotten that much better.I'm really
 

127
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:41,470

 

128
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,350

bad at games like this,

129
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:43,360
bad at games like this,
 

130
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,880
bad at games like this,
but even so, I've been practicing quietly and

131
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:47,890
but even so, I've been practicing quietly and
 

132
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:50,340
but even so, I've been practicing quietly and
working really hard, and I'm seeing the results.

00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:53,760

 

136
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,610

that my sister and I can't play together with everyone else,

137
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:56,620
that my sister and I can't play together with everyone else,
 

138
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,620
that my sister and I can't play together with everyone else,
so I

139
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:58,630
so I
 

140
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,270
so I
don't really play Mario Kart.

141
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,980
don't really play Mario Kart.
 

142
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,770

 

143
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:05,780

 

144
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,450

When I say "Let's go," I'm like, "Where are we all?" It's

145
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:09,220
When I say "Let's go," I'm like, "Where are we all?" It's
 

146
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:09,230

 

147
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:13,540

like, "We've all already reached the goal." That's basically what happened in front of that one call, like they were

148
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:13,550

interested in the entertainment that was waiting for them.  It

00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:20,360
interested in the entertainment that was waiting for them.  It
 

151
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:20,370

 

152
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:24,350

seems like it used to be, but now it's like my

153
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:24,360
seems like it used to be, but now it's like my
 

154
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,050
seems like it used to be, but now it's like my
brother is messing around and saying things like 6 is good or not,
