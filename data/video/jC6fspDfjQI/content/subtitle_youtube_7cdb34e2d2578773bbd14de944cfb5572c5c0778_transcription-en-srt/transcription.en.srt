while having
 

11941
07:11:26,718 --> 07:11:30,628
while having
cancer but then they could have then

11942
07:11:30,628 --> 07:11:30,638
cancer but then they could have then
 

11943
07:11:30,638 --> 07:11:32,270
cancer but then they could have then
they didn't need to give him cancer if

11944
07:11:32,270 --> 07:11:32,280
they didn't need to give him cancer if
 

11945
07:11:32,280 --> 07:11:34,310
they didn't need to give him cancer if
you want to make it like that you could

11946
07:11:34,310 --> 07:11:34,320
you want to make it like that you could
 

11947
07:11:34,320 --> 07:11:36,670
you want to make it like that you could
have died protecting someone I don't

11948

know Ichiban taking a bullet for Ichiban

11950

11951
07:11:39,120 --> 07:11:41,590
know Ichiban taking a bullet for Ichiban
oh my God if that actually

11952
07:11:41,590 --> 07:11:41,600
oh my God if that actually
 

11953
07:11:41,600 --> 07:11:43,388
oh my God if that actually
happens

11954
07:11:43,388 --> 07:11:43,398
happens
 

11955
07:11:43,398 --> 07:11:47,548
happens
oh quote me

11956
07:11:47,548 --> 07:11:47,558

 

11957
07:11:47,558 --> 07:11:49,880

now um

11958
07:11:49,880 --> 07:11:49,890
now um
 

11959
07:11:49,890 --> 07:11:52,990
now um
[Laughter]

11960
07:11:52,990 --> 07:11:53,000
[Laughter]
 

11961
07:11:53,000 --> 07:11:55,910
[Laughter]
but the cancer is unnecessary a little

11962
07:11:55,910 --> 07:11:55,920
but the cancer is unnecessary a little
 

11963
07:11:55,920 --> 07:11:57,708
but the cancer is unnecessary a little
bit they could have just uh had a very

11964
07:11:57,708 --> 07:11:57,718
bit they could have just uh had a very
 

11965
07:11:57,718 --> 07:12:00,830
bit they could have just uh had a very
dramatic like but then then if it was

11966
07:12:00,830 --> 07:12:00,840
dramatic like but then then if it was
 

11967
07:12:00,840 --> 07:12:02,388
dramatic like but then then if it was
something more like taking a bullet or

11968
07:12:02,388 --> 07:12:02,398
something more like taking a bullet or
 

11969
07:12:02,398 --> 07:12:04,948
something more like taking a bullet or
so there would have been no reason to do

11970
07:12:04,948 --> 07:12:04,958
so there would have been no reason to do
 

11971
07:12:04,958 --> 07:12:06,788
so there would have been no reason to do
all this bucket list stuff and like let

11972
07:12:06,788 --> 07:12:06,798
all this bucket list stuff and like let
 

11973
07:12:06,798 --> 07:12:08,270
all this bucket list stuff and like let
him meet all these people and all that

11974
07:12:08,270 --> 07:12:08,280
him meet all these people and all that
 

11975
07:12:08,280 --> 07:12:09,868
him meet all these people and all that
with cancer you know that he's going to

11976
07:12:09,868 --> 07:12:09,878
with cancer you know that he's going to
 

11977
07:12:09,878 --> 07:12:13,070
with cancer you know that he's going to
die and then we have a reason why for

11978
07:12:13,070 --> 07:12:13,080
die and then we have a reason why for
 

11979
07:12:13,080 --> 07:12:15,230
die and then we have a reason why for
many many chapters in the game we can

11980
07:12:15,230 --> 07:12:15,240
many many chapters in the game we can
 

11981
07:12:15,240 --> 07:12:17,990
many many chapters in the game we can
lead him yeah through this like trip of

11982
07:12:17,990 --> 07:12:18,000
lead him yeah through this like trip of
 

11983
07:12:18,000 --> 07:12:19,270
lead him yeah through this like trip of
memory

11984
07:12:19,270 --> 07:12:19,280
memory
 

11985
07:12:19,280 --> 07:12:22,350

Hall so it has to be something that is

11986
07:12:22,350 --> 07:12:22,360
Hall so it has to be something that is
 

11987
07:12:22,360 --> 07:12:24,590
Hall so it has to be something that is
cooking and that we know is coming

11988
07:12:24,590 --> 07:12:24,600
cooking and that we know is coming
 

11989
07:12:24,600 --> 07:12:25,948
cooking and that we know is coming
slowly but

11990
07:12:25,948 --> 07:12:25,958
slowly but
 

11991
07:12:25,958 --> 07:12:29,110
slowly but
surely so that we can do this oh so he's

11992
07:12:29,110 --> 07:12:29,120
surely so that we can do this oh so he's
 

11993
07:12:29,120 --> 07:12:31,628
surely so that we can do this oh so he's
definitely going to die

11994
07:12:31,628 --> 07:12:31,638
definitely going to die
 

11995
07:12:31,638 --> 07:12:33,510
definitely going to die
it's just making more and more sense in

11996
07:12:33,510 --> 07:12:33,520
it's just making more and more sense in
 

11997
07:12:33,520 --> 07:12:43,450
it's just making more and more sense in
my brain more and more sense in my

11998
07:12:43,450 --> 07:12:43,460

yeah I don't know I still find it weird

12004
07:12:52,230 --> 07:12:52,240
yeah I don't know I still find it weird
 

12005
07:12:52,240 --> 07:12:55,468
yeah I don't know I still find it weird
to like kill off a character like this

12006
07:12:55,468 --> 07:12:55,478
to like kill off a character like this
 

12007
07:12:55,478 --> 07:12:58,230
to like kill off a character like this
though like would they really do that

12008
07:12:58,230 --> 07:12:58,240
though like would they really do that
 

12009
07:12:58,240 --> 07:13:03,510
though like would they really do that
but then all the signs are leading to

12010
07:13:03,510 --> 07:13:03,520
but then all the signs are leading to
 

12011
07:13:03,520 --> 07:13:10,948
but then all the signs are leading to
it but that's just a theory a game

complaint cuz you can do a complaint for
the food being off and you can do a

12152
07:16:37,590 --> 07:16:37,600
the food being off and you can do a
 

12153
07:16:37,600 --> 07:16:39,628
the food being off and you can do a
complaint for the packaging being open

12154
07:16:39,628 --> 07:16:39,638
complaint for the packaging being open
 

12155

12157
07:16:41,718 --> 07:16:43,270
and so on but I just did the O package
is open one because I thought that's

12158
07:16:43,270 --> 07:16:43,280
is open one because I thought that's
 

12159
07:16:43,280 --> 07:16:44,910
is open one because I thought that's
just like it makes sense obviously if

12160
07:16:44,910 --> 07:16:44,920
just like it makes sense obviously if
 

12161
07:16:44,920 --> 07:16:46,910
just like it makes sense obviously if
the package of a fish is open then the

12162
07:16:46,910 --> 07:16:46,920
the package of a fish is open then the
 

12163
07:16:46,920 --> 07:16:48,708
the package of a fish is open then the
result is probably that the fish is

12164
07:16:48,708 --> 07:16:48,718
result is probably that the fish is
 

12165
07:16:48,718 --> 07:16:50,030
result is probably that the fish is
going to go

12166
07:16:50,030 --> 07:16:50,040

12167
07:16:50,040 --> 07:16:52,190
