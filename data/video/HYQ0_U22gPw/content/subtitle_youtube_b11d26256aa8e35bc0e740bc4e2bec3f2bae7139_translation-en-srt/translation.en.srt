1892
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:01,270
Okay, finally, there's only one more person left, and it was definitely this Ame-chan color. I also
want a dog and Ame-chan, but I need a little help.

1893
01:07:01,270 --> 01:07:01,280
want a dog and Ame-chan, but I need a little help.

That's right, but if it starts with human interviews, I

That's right, but if it starts with human interviews, I
still have Oku Resources and the 200 Waterfall Reactor, but the house.  Resources are tight, right?

1897
01:07:09,329 --> 01:07:09,339
still have Oku Resources and the 200 Waterfall Reactor, but the house.  Resources are tight, right?

With the reactor, you can gather everyone in the same place, so it's

With the reactor, you can gather everyone in the same place, so it's
 

1902
01:07:15,470 --> 01:07:20,700
With the reactor, you can gather everyone in the same place, so it's
easy and simple, but it's easy, but because you're away from each other,

1903
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:20,710
easy and simple, but it's easy, but because you're away from each other,
 

1904
01:07:20,710 --> 01:07:24,900
easy and simple, but it's easy, but because you're away from each other,
the moment you leave, you're called fat.  I've

1905
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:24,910

 

1906
01:07:24,910 --> 01:07:28,140

taken care of that. It's Akari,

1907
01:07:28,140 --> 01:07:28,150

 

1908
01:07:28,150 --> 01:07:34,550

isn't it? It's quite

1909
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:34,560

 

1910
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:39,900

difficult.

1911
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:39,910

 

1912
01:07:39,910 --> 01:07:51,180

I haven't been able to do the task at all yet,

1913
01:07:51,180 --> 01:07:51,190

 

1914
01:07:51,190 --> 01:07:53,450


1915
01:07:53,450 --> 01:07:53,460

 

1916
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:59,630

so it's okay. Maybe I'm to blame, too.  I

01:07:59,630 --> 01:08:09,000

 

1918
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:09,010
