them just because it's too annoying I've
 

639
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:49,970
them just because it's too annoying I've
been paying them even though I don't

640
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:49,980
been paying them even though I don't
 

641
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,930
been paying them even though I don't
have like I have a TV but I'm I'm not

642
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:53,940
have like I have a TV but I'm I'm not
 

643
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,409
have like I have a TV but I'm I'm not
using what they would need you to pay

644
00:19:57,409 --> 00:19:57,419
using what they would need you to pay
 

645
00:19:57,419 --> 00:20:00,049
using what they would need you to pay
for you know I'm just using Netflix and

646
00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:00,059
for you know I'm just using Netflix and
 

647
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:03,169
for you know I'm just using Netflix and
stuff like that but in theory my TV I

648
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:03,179
stuff like that but in theory my TV I
 

649
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:06,890
stuff like that but in theory my TV I
guess could if I attached it to that

650
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:06,900
guess could if I attached it to that
 

651
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,130
guess could if I attached it to that
little box in the wall

652
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:10,140
little box in the wall
 

653
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,630
little box in the wall
I don't even have a cable for that

654
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:11,640
I don't even have a cable for that
 

655
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,669
I don't even have a cable for that
though but in theory I guess it could

656
00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:13,679
though but in theory I guess it could
 

657
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,090
though but in theory I guess it could
receive TV stuff so because of that you

658
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:17,100
receive TV stuff so because of that you
 

659
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,350
receive TV stuff so because of that you
have to pay

660
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:18,360

but at least it doesn't go up to the
 

831
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,370
but at least it doesn't go up to the
minimum of 50.

00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:10,380
minimum of 50.
 

833

1220
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:12,000
well for him very sad he said so let's
 

1221
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:18,950
well for him very sad he said so let's
go

1222
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:18,960

 

1223
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,710

um I said to my brother that even even

1224
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:21,720
um I said to my brother that even even
 

1225
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,830
um I said to my brother that even even
if the holes were already there

1226
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:24,840
if the holes were already there
 

1227
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,409
if the holes were already there
I think we should just brute force it

1228
00:33:27,409 --> 00:33:27,419
I think we should just brute force it
 

1229
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:31,549
I think we should just brute force it
and assume that maybe maybe the holes

1230
00:33:31,549 --> 00:33:31,559
and assume that maybe maybe the holes
 

1231
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:33,710
and assume that maybe maybe the holes
were in the wrong place I can't really

1232
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:33,720
were in the wrong place I can't really
 

1233
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,930
were in the wrong place I can't really
imagine that happening but apparently

1234
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:35,940
imagine that happening but apparently
 

1235
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,850
imagine that happening but apparently
sometimes it happens right

1236
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:37,860
sometimes it happens right
 

1237
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:40,730
sometimes it happens right
in production so I I say yeah just let's

1238
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:40,740
in production so I I say yeah just let's
 

1239
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,889
in production so I I say yeah just let's
just make our own holes because it looks

1240
00:33:42,889 --> 00:33:42,899
just make our own holes because it looks
 

1241
00:33:42,899 --> 00:33:45,169
just make our own holes because it looks
like it must work if we just

1242
00:33:45,169 --> 00:33:45,179
like it must work if we just
 

1243
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:47,450
like it must work if we just
scooch everything lower

1244
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:47,460
scooch everything lower
 

1245
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:52,610
scooch everything lower
make our own holes we can we can

1246
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:52,620
make our own holes we can we can
 

1247
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,389
make our own holes we can we can
um

1248
00:33:53,389 --> 00:33:53,399
um
 

1249
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:56,570
um
yeah we just make our own holes scooch

1250
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:56,580
yeah we just make our own holes scooch
 

1251
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,909
yeah we just make our own holes scooch
it down

1252
00:33:58,909 --> 00:33:58,919
it down
 

1253
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:01,310
it down
and then it should work

1254
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:01,320
and then it should work
 

1255
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,889
and then it should work
but we'll build the second one first

1256
00:34:03,889 --> 00:34:03,899
but we'll build the second one first
 

1257
00:34:03,899 --> 00:34:05,630
but we'll build the second one first
today

1258
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:05,640
today
 

1259
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,430
today
from zero

1260
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:07,440
from zero
 

1261
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,470
from zero
and see if we missed something but we

1262
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:09,480
and see if we missed something but we
 

1263
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,970
and see if we missed something but we
really looked at everything so closely

1264
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:13,980

 

1265
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:25,510

we paid a lot of attention to it

1266
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:25,520

 

1267
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,490

why not

1268
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:28,500
why not
 

1269
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,770
why not
those machines make no mistake that's

1270
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:30,780
those machines make no mistake that's
 

1271
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:33,349
those machines make no mistake that's
what I kind of thought

1272
00:34:33,349 --> 00:34:33,359
what I kind of thought
 

1273
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:36,530
what I kind of thought
no nothing is Switched no nothing is

1274
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:36,540
no nothing is Switched no nothing is
 

1275

balanced if we keep on adding and we'll

2490
01:08:45,590 --> 01:08:45,600
balanced if we keep on adding and we'll
 

2491
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:47,450
balanced if we keep on adding and we'll
be 10 eventually and then and then it

2492
01:08:47,450 --> 01:08:47,460
be 10 eventually and then and then it
 

2493
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:49,130
be 10 eventually and then and then it
will be even more difficult to use them

2494
01:08:49,130 --> 01:08:49,140
will be even more difficult to use them
 

2495
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:50,630
will be even more difficult to use them
as a unit because you don't you have to

2496
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:50,640
as a unit because you don't you have to
 

2497
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:52,910
as a unit because you don't you have to
use them all

2498
01:08:52,910 --> 01:08:52,920
use them all
 

2499
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:54,349
use them all
um

consider that because I this is the
 

3973
01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:53,570
consider that because I this is the
second year in a row right didn't they

3974
01:52:53,570 --> 01:52:53,580
second year in a row right didn't they

second year in a row right didn't they
use a live band last year too

01:52:56,209 --> 01:52:56,219
use a live band last year too
 

3977
01:52:56,219 --> 01:52:58,490
use a live band last year too

01:52:58,490 --> 01:52:58,500
in that case
 

3979
01:52:58,500 --> 01:53:02,330
in that case
I will consider it and not choose the

3980
01:53:02,330 --> 01:53:02,340
I will consider it and not choose the
 

3981
01:53:02,340 --> 01:53:04,129
I will consider it and not choose the
one I want to perform the most but the

3982
01:53:04,129 --> 01:53:04,139
one I want to perform the most but the
 

3983

one I want to perform the most but the
one that would fit the most

3984
01:53:05,930 --> 01:53:05,940
one that would fit the most
 

3985
01:53:05,940 --> 01:53:08,390
one that would fit the most
if they use the live band again

3986
01:53:08,390 --> 01:53:08,400
if they use the live band again
 

3987
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:12,050
if they use the live band again

01:58:31,860 --> 01:58:34,850
um from what I've seen it's like they
are very unlikely to get into these

4208
01:58:34,850 --> 01:58:34,860
are very unlikely to get into these
 

4209
01:58:34,860 --> 01:58:37,550
are very unlikely to get into these
things when they have to type it out and

4210
01:58:37,550 --> 01:58:37,560
things when they have to type it out and
 

4211
01:58:37,560 --> 01:58:42,410
things when they have to type it out and
they're against like kaigai nikkis

4212
01:58:42,410 --> 01:58:42,420
they're against like kaigai nikkis
