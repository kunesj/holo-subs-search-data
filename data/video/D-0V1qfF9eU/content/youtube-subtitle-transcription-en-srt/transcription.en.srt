2901
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:07,990

fast I'm going to try to make another D

2902
01:16:07,990 --> 01:16:08,000
fast I'm going to try to make another D
 

2903

collector but I don't know if there's a

2904
01:16:09,310 --> 01:16:09,320
collector but I don't know if there's a
 

2905
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:14,870
collector but I don't know if there's a
better way to collect water um so what I

2906
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:14,880
better way to collect water um so what I
 

2907
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:18,470
better way to collect water um so what I
assume is there are mods to mod the DU

2908
01:16:18,470 --> 01:16:18,480
assume is there are mods to mod the DU
 

2909
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:20,390
assume is there are mods to mod the DU
collector on the right side if you look

2910
01:16:20,390 --> 01:16:20,400
collector on the right side if you look
 

2911
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:22,229
collector on the right side if you look
at the Duke collector you can buy those

2912
01:16:22,229 --> 01:16:22,239
at the Duke collector you can buy those
 

2913
01:16:22,239 --> 01:16:26,470
at the Duke collector you can buy those
from the Traders um so might want to

2914
01:16:26,470 --> 01:16:26,480

you guys know if you have like two
weapons but one is higher level like I

9420
04:06:17,590 --> 04:06:17,600
weapons but one is higher level like I
 

9421
04:06:17,600 --> 04:06:20,229
weapons but one is higher level like I
have one five level five item and one

9422
04:06:20,229 --> 04:06:20,239
have one five level five item and one
 

9423
04:06:20,239 --> 04:06:21,830
have one five level five item and one
level three item how big is the

9424
04:06:21,830 --> 04:06:21,840
level three item how big is the
 

9425
04:06:21,840 --> 04:06:25,510
level three item how big is the
difference there the I wonder the higher

9426
04:06:25,510 --> 04:06:25,520
difference there the I wonder the higher
 

9427
04:06:25,520 --> 04:06:27,990
difference there the I wonder the higher
tier like the like for example if you

9428
04:06:27,990 --> 04:06:28,000
tier like the like for example if you
 

9429
04:06:28,000 --> 04:06:30,070
tier like the like for example if you
have a bone knife and a hunting knife

9430
04:06:30,070 --> 04:06:30,080
have a bone knife and a hunting knife
 

9431
04:06:30,080 --> 04:06:31,750
have a bone knife and a hunting knife
the hunting knife will be better than

9432
04:06:31,750 --> 04:06:31,760
the hunting knife will be better than
 

9433
04:06:31,760 --> 04:06:34,830
the hunting knife will be better than
the level five bone knife but uh if you

9434
04:06:34,830 --> 04:06:34,840
the level five bone knife but uh if you
 

9435
04:06:34,840 --> 04:06:36,750
the level five bone knife but uh if you
have the higher number it's going to

9436
04:06:36,750 --> 04:06:36,760
have the higher number it's going to
 

9437
