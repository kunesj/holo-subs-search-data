okay that's overcooked

6516
02:28:02,950 --> 02:28:02,960

 

6517
02:28:02,960 --> 02:28:10,469

6521
02:28:13,040 --> 02:28:14,950
shot that's a shotgun it's so long
though i thought that uh

6522
02:28:14,950 --> 02:28:14,960
though i thought that uh
 

6523
02:28:14,960 --> 02:28:17,030
though i thought that uh
the shorter the gun

6524
02:28:17,030 --> 02:28:17,040
the shorter the gun
 

6525
02:28:17,040 --> 02:28:18,469
the shorter the gun
the shorter

6526
02:28:18,469 --> 02:28:18,479
the shorter
 

6527
02:28:18,479 --> 02:28:20,150
the shorter
maybe the range i don't know because

6528
02:28:20,150 --> 02:28:20,160
maybe the range i don't know because
 

6529
02:28:20,160 --> 02:28:23,110
maybe the range i don't know because

03:40:10,229 --> 03:40:10,239
the rest i guess
 

9473
03:40:10,239 --> 03:40:10,950
the rest i guess
if

9474
03:40:10,950 --> 03:40:10,960
if
 

9475
03:40:10,960 --> 03:40:13,670
