but at the end, I just
 

2095
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:37,130
but at the end, I just
decided last night.

2096
01:21:37,130 --> 01:21:37,140
decided last night.
 

2097
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:40,630
decided last night.
Thank you. It's funny.

2098
01:21:40,630 --> 01:21:40,640

 

2099
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:44,330

I

2100
01:21:44,330 --> 01:21:44,340
I
 

2101
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:47,630
I
don't play FPS games like APEX or anything like that.  It seems like we

2102
01:21:47,630 --> 01:21:47,640
don't play FPS games like APEX or anything like that.  It seems like we
 

2103
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:53,270
don't play FPS games like APEX or anything like that.  It seems like we
haven't had any collaborations like that at all.The reason for this was that we

2104
01:21:53,270 --> 01:21:54,950
haven't had any collaborations like that at all.The reason for this was that we
 

2105
01:21:54,950 --> 01:21:54,960

 

2106
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:59,050

didn't really match each other's hobbies, but

2107
01:21:59,050 --> 01:21:59,060
didn't really match each other's hobbies, but
 

2108
01:21:59,060 --> 01:22:04,370
didn't really match each other's hobbies, but
now that we have Netflix, Game Strong, I

2109
01:22:04,370 --> 01:22:04,380
now that we have Netflix, Game Strong, I
 

2110
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:08,649
now that we have Netflix, Game Strong, I
'll send you another message next time.  It's

01:22:08,649 --> 01:22:08,659

 

2112
01:22:08,659 --> 01:22:13,189

really only at the very end, so
please trust me. It's
