00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:00,020
reason I was born is
 

1068
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:04,609
reason I was born is
that when I fail in some kind of cooking game, I'm

1069
00:53:04,609 --> 00:53:04,619
that when I fail in some kind of cooking game, I'm
 

1070
00:53:04,619 --> 00:53:06,710
that when I fail in some kind of cooking game, I'm
carried away on rails,

00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:06,720
carried away on rails,
 

1072
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:10,190
carried away on rails,
but when I look at the trash can, I look, look, look, I

1073
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:10,200
but when I look at the trash can, I look, look, look, I
 

1074

00:53:17,089 --> 00:53:17,099
think too much about
 

1078
00:53:17,099 --> 00:53:18,890
think too much about
it, just write it down.I don't think it's okay

1079
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:18,900
it, just write it down.I don't think it's okay
 

1080
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:23,089
it, just write it down.I don't think it's okay
since you're a listener.On the other hand, if you think

1081
00:53:23,089 --> 00:53:23,099
since you're a listener.On the other hand, if you think
 

1082
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:25,370

about things like how to design something, it

1083
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:25,380
about things like how to design something, it
 

1084
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:29,470
about things like how to design something, it
won't be possible to put it into form, so don't

1085
00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:29,480
won't be possible to put it into form, so don't
 

1086
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:32,990
won't be possible to put it into form, so don't
think too much about it.  Is it better not to write it?

1087
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:35,770
think too much about it.  Is it better not to write it?

1089
00:53:35,780 --> 00:54:00,440

Maybe it's better to just doodle without thinking.

Why did you become friends with Okayu-senpai?  I was
introduced to her by a friend,

introduced to her by a friend,

1743
01:21:17,460 --> 01:21:21,550
but Corde was shy and shy, and
was the type of person who wouldn't go out on her own, so I

1744
01:21:21,550 --> 01:21:21,560

 

1745
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:24,729

didn't ask her to join me, but

01:21:24,729 --> 01:21:24,739
didn't ask her to join me, but
 

1747
01:21:24,739 --> 01:21:27,890
didn't ask her to join me, but
she started talking to me a lot after that, and she said we

she started talking to me a lot after that, and she said we
 

1749
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:31,610
she started talking to me a lot after that, and she said we
should talk on the phone and play games together.  He

1750
01:21:31,610 --> 01:21:31,620
should talk on the phone and play games together.  He
 

1751
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:34,370
should talk on the phone and play games together.  He
invited me to so many things,

invited me to so many things,

So, were you

1780
01:22:20,780 --> 01:22:25,510

using Skype at that time

01:22:25,510 --> 01:22:25,520
using Skype at that time
 

1782
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:27,530
using Skype at that time
? I think it was Skype.

1783
01:22:27,530 --> 01:22:27,540
? I think it was Skype.
 

1784
01:22:27,540 --> 01:22:32,149
? I think it was Skype.
Skype was more popular in the past,

1785
01:22:32,149 --> 01:22:32,159
Skype was more popular in the past,
 

1786
01:22:32,159 --> 01:22:34,209
Skype was more popular in the past,
so maybe that's why.

1787
01:22:34,209 --> 01:22:34,219
so maybe that's why.
 

1788
01:22:34,219 --> 01:22:39,610
so maybe that's why.
So we became friends pretty quickly. That's
