go to a different hospital I noticed
that if you steal something once it

2176
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:41,520
that if you steal something once it
 

2177
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,490
that if you steal something once it
doesn't come back to the house

2178
00:55:43,490 --> 00:55:43,500
doesn't come back to the house
 

2179
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,890
doesn't come back to the house
so

2180
00:55:45,890 --> 00:55:45,900
so
 

2181
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:47,870
so
I can't steal the same things over and

2182
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:47,880
I can't steal the same things over and
 

2183
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:50,930
I can't steal the same things over and
over again but I mean I still left some

2184
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:50,940
over again but I mean I still left some
 

2185
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:53,030
over again but I mean I still left some
big items in some of the previous

2186
00:55:53,030 --> 00:55:53,040
big items in some of the previous
 

2187
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,890
big items in some of the previous
buildings

2188
00:55:54,890 --> 00:55:54,900
buildings
 

2189
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:57,470
buildings
so in theory I could go back to those I

2190
00:55:57,470 --> 00:55:57,480
so in theory I could go back to those I
 

2191
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:00,430
so in theory I could go back to those I
guess

2192
00:56:00,430 --> 00:56:00,440

 

2193
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:03,829

that would be a little broken I guess so

2194
00:56:03,829 --> 00:56:03,839
that would be a little broken I guess so
 

2195
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:06,109
that would be a little broken I guess so
what if you spend too much money and you

2196
00:56:06,109 --> 00:56:06,119
what if you spend too much money and you
 

2197

what if you spend too much money and you
need more money

2198
00:56:09,890 --> 00:56:09,900

700 all right I think we're gonna be
able to afford

4960
02:07:25,010 --> 02:07:25,020
able to afford
 

4961
02:07:25,020 --> 02:07:26,410
able to afford
um

4962
02:07:26,410 --> 02:07:26,420
um
 

4963
02:07:26,420 --> 02:07:31,010
um

4964
02:07:31,010 --> 02:07:31,020
the rest of the tools just fine
 

4965
02:07:31,020 --> 02:07:34,990
the rest of the tools just fine
when when the guitar

4966
02:07:34,990 --> 02:07:35,000
when when the guitar
 

4967
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,370
when when the guitar
and they keep on restocking the guitar

4968
02:07:37,370 --> 02:07:37,380
and they keep on restocking the guitar
 

4969
02:07:37,380 --> 02:07:41,270
and they keep on restocking the guitar
too so I think those are like easy

4970
02:07:41,270 --> 02:07:41,280
too so I think those are like easy

4988
02:08:07,790 --> 02:08:07,800
oh now I don't have money for the tenant
 

4989
02:08:07,800 --> 02:08:09,830
oh now I don't have money for the tenant
routines though

4990
02:08:09,830 --> 02:08:09,840
routines though
 

4991
02:08:09,840 --> 02:08:12,830
routines though
all right let's train this one here what

4992
02:08:12,830 --> 02:08:12,840
all right let's train this one here what
 

4993
02:08:12,840 --> 02:08:15,649
all right let's train this one here what
hold the rotate Direction shown by the

4994
02:08:15,649 --> 02:08:15,659
hold the rotate Direction shown by the
 

4995
02:08:15,659 --> 02:08:18,050
hold the rotate Direction shown by the
arrows until the tone of the sound

4996
02:08:18,050 --> 02:08:18,060
arrows until the tone of the sound
 

4997
02:08:18,060 --> 02:08:20,810
arrows until the tone of the sound
changes then carefully press the proper

4998
02:08:20,810 --> 02:08:20,820
changes then carefully press the proper
 

4999
02:08:20,820 --> 02:08:22,609
changes then carefully press the proper
direction until the combination is

5000
02:08:22,609 --> 02:08:22,619
direction until the combination is
 

5001
02:08:22,619 --> 02:08:23,810
direction until the combination is
accepted

5002
02:08:23,810 --> 02:08:23,820
accepted
 

5003
02:08:23,820 --> 02:08:25,790
accepted
oh okay

5004
02:08:25,790 --> 02:08:25,800
oh okay
 

5005
02:08:25,800 --> 02:08:27,770
oh okay
after that start rotating in the

5006
02:08:27,770 --> 02:08:27,780
after that start rotating in the
 

5007
02:08:27,780 --> 02:08:29,330
after that start rotating in the
opposite direction okay what I don't

5008
02:08:29,330 --> 02:08:29,340
opposite direction okay what I don't
 

5009
02:08:29,340 --> 02:08:31,850
opposite direction okay what I don't
understand

5010
02:08:31,850 --> 02:08:31,860

 

5011
02:08:31,860 --> 02:08:40,070

did it change

5012
02:08:40,070 --> 02:08:40,080

 

5013
02:08:40,080 --> 02:08:42,109

yeah

5014
02:08:42,109 --> 02:08:42,119
yeah
 

5015
02:08:42,119 --> 02:08:45,109
yeah
was that okay was that good

5016
02:08:45,109 --> 02:08:45,119
was that okay was that good
 

5017
02:08:45,119 --> 02:08:46,490
was that okay was that good
that's the proper direction until

5018
02:08:46,490 --> 02:08:46,500
that's the proper direction until
 

5019
02:08:46,500 --> 02:08:57,950
that's the proper direction until
combination is accepted so 66 okay

5020
02:08:57,950 --> 02:08:57,960

 

5021
02:08:57,960 --> 02:09:02,229

oh what

5022
02:09:02,229 --> 02:09:02,239

 

5023
02:09:02,239 --> 02:09:05,930

I understand

5024
02:09:05,930 --> 02:09:05,940

 

5025
02:09:05,940 --> 02:09:10,250

slowest wait do I have to type in 66 now

5026
02:09:10,250 --> 02:09:10,260
slowest wait do I have to type in 66 now
 

5027
02:09:10,260 --> 02:09:12,350
slowest wait do I have to type in 66 now
I went too far

5028
02:09:12,350 --> 02:09:12,360
I went too far
 

5029
02:09:12,360 --> 02:09:15,050
I went too far
ah wait so I know it happens around 66

5030
02:09:15,050 --> 02:09:15,060
ah wait so I know it happens around 66
 

5031
02:09:15,060 --> 02:09:18,470
ah wait so I know it happens around 66
so around there I should go slower

5032
02:09:18,470 --> 02:09:18,480
so around there I should go slower
 

5033
02:09:18,480 --> 02:09:23,950
so around there I should go slower
because it's like immediately over

5034
02:09:23,950 --> 02:09:23,960

 

5035
02:09:23,960 --> 02:09:25,490

ah

5036
02:09:25,490 --> 02:09:25,500
ah
 

5037
02:09:25,500 --> 02:09:32,149
ah
and now that's ah okay okay

5038
02:09:32,149 --> 02:09:32,159

 

5039
02:09:32,159 --> 02:09:35,510

well this might [\h__\h] it up again now

5040
02:09:35,510 --> 02:09:35,520
well this might [\h__\h] it up again now
 

5041
02:09:35,520 --> 02:09:38,050
well this might [\h__\h] it up again now
I have to redo it right from the start

5042
02:09:38,050 --> 02:09:38,060
I have to redo it right from the start
 

5043
02:09:38,060 --> 02:09:52,250
I have to redo it right from the start
so let's go slowly

5044
02:09:52,250 --> 02:09:52,260

 

5045
02:09:52,260 --> 02:09:54,169

how far

5046
02:09:54,169 --> 02:09:54,179
how far
 

5047
02:09:54,179 --> 02:09:55,609
how far
I didn't even know that this is how

5048
02:09:55,609 --> 02:09:55,619
I didn't even know that this is how
 

5049
02:09:55,619 --> 02:09:57,290
I didn't even know that this is how
saves work I've never like in hotel

5050
02:09:57,290 --> 02:09:57,300
saves work I've never like in hotel
 

5051

I've never used one before because I

5054
02:10:01,070 --> 02:10:01,080
I've never used one before because I
 

5055
02:10:01,080 --> 02:10:02,810
I've never used one before because I
have no idea how how they work how do

5056
02:10:02,810 --> 02:10:02,820
have no idea how how they work how do
 

5057
02:10:02,820 --> 02:10:08,689
have no idea how how they work how do
you even set your own code

5058
02:10:08,689 --> 02:10:08,699

 

5059
02:10:08,699 --> 02:10:11,810
