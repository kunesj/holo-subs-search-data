8165
04:05:47,680 --> 04:05:50,870

30 to 40 minutes it felt longer it might

8166
04:05:50,870 --> 04:05:50,880
30 to 40 minutes it felt longer it might
 

8167
04:05:50,880 --> 04:05:52,630
30 to 40 minutes it felt longer it might
have been longer i feel like we might

8168
04:05:52,630 --> 04:05:52,640
have been longer i feel like we might
 

8169
04:05:52,640 --> 04:05:54,309
have been longer i feel like we might
have been standing there for an hour to

8170
04:05:54,309 --> 04:05:54,319
have been standing there for an hour to
 

8171
04:05:54,319 --> 04:06:12,389
have been standing there for an hour to
be honest i'm not sure

8172
04:06:12,389 --> 04:06:12,399

 

8173
04:06:12,399 --> 04:06:15,030

yeah the line was especially

8174
04:06:15,030 --> 04:06:15,040
yeah the line was especially
 

8175
04:06:15,040 --> 04:06:17,349
yeah the line was especially
slow because um

8176
04:06:17,349 --> 04:06:17,359
slow because um
 

8177
04:06:17,359 --> 04:06:19,990
slow because um
they were only letting in eight people i

8178
04:06:19,990 --> 04:06:20,000
they were only letting in eight people i
 

8179
04:06:20,000 --> 04:06:21,189
they were only letting in eight people i
think

8180
04:06:21,189 --> 04:06:21,199
think
 

8181
04:06:21,199 --> 04:06:23,830
think
uh at the most into the store

8182
04:06:23,830 --> 04:06:23,840
uh at the most into the store
 

8183
04:06:23,840 --> 04:06:27,590
uh at the most into the store
due to the sea thing um

8184
04:06:27,590 --> 04:06:27,600
due to the sea thing um
 

8185
04:06:27,600 --> 04:06:29,750
due to the sea thing um
so i think under normal conditions it

8186
04:06:29,750 --> 04:06:29,760
so i think under normal conditions it
 

8187
04:06:29,760 --> 04:06:34,150
so i think under normal conditions it
wouldn't be that bad and also

8188
04:06:34,150 --> 04:06:34,160

 

8189
04:06:34,160 --> 04:06:37,189

something i figured out later on

8190
04:06:37,189 --> 04:06:37,199
something i figured out later on
 

8191
04:06:37,199 --> 04:06:41,030
something i figured out later on
uh this was a saturday so maybe during

8192
04:06:41,030 --> 04:06:41,040
uh this was a saturday so maybe during
 

8193
04:06:41,040 --> 04:06:43,590
uh this was a saturday so maybe during
the weekday it's not that bad

8194
04:06:43,590 --> 04:06:43,600
the weekday it's not that bad
 

8195
04:06:43,600 --> 04:06:45,670
the weekday it's not that bad
but the reason why it might have been

8196
04:06:45,670 --> 04:06:45,680
but the reason why it might have been
 

8197
04:06:45,680 --> 04:06:48,469
but the reason why it might have been
even worse on saturday uh not just

8198
04:06:48,469 --> 04:06:48,479
even worse on saturday uh not just
 

8199
04:06:48,479 --> 04:06:50,309
even worse on saturday uh not just
because it's a weekend but

8200
04:06:50,309 --> 04:06:50,319
because it's a weekend but
 

8201
04:06:50,319 --> 04:06:52,550
because it's a weekend but
apparently

8202
04:06:52,550 --> 04:06:52,560
apparently
 

8203
04:06:52,560 --> 04:06:54,630
apparently
every weekend

8204
04:06:54,630 --> 04:06:54,640
every weekend
 

8205
04:06:54,640 --> 04:06:56,710
every weekend
uh

8206
04:06:56,710 --> 04:06:56,720

8207
04:06:56,720 --> 04:06:59,269
uh

correctly
uh of like

8212
04:07:02,870 --> 04:07:02,880
uh of like
 

8213
04:07:02,880 --> 04:07:04,389
uh of like
you know

8214
04:07:04,389 --> 04:07:04,399
you know
 

8215
04:07:04,399 --> 04:07:06,469
you know
people

8216
04:07:06,469 --> 04:07:06,479

japan fans and cosplayers and weeps in
the the big park where that big

8220
04:07:12,550 --> 04:07:12,560
the the big park where that big
 

8221
04:07:12,560 --> 04:07:15,429
the the big park where that big
convention happens which is somewhat

8222
04:07:15,429 --> 04:07:15,439
convention happens which is somewhat
 

8223
04:07:15,439 --> 04:07:18,870
convention happens which is somewhat
close to this uh japanese

8224
04:07:18,870 --> 04:07:18,880
close to this uh japanese
 

8225
04:07:18,880 --> 04:07:20,469

city street

8226
04:07:20,469 --> 04:07:20,479
city street
 

8227
04:07:20,479 --> 04:07:23,590
city street
in the city center um

8228
04:07:23,590 --> 04:07:23,600
in the city center um
 

8229
04:07:23,600 --> 04:07:26,550
in the city center um
yeah apparently it's every week

8230
04:07:26,550 --> 04:07:26,560
yeah apparently it's every week
 

8231
04:07:26,560 --> 04:07:27,349
yeah apparently it's every week
so

8232
04:07:27,349 --> 04:07:27,359
so
 

8233
04:07:27,359 --> 04:07:29,910
so
i think probably what they do is that

8234
04:07:29,910 --> 04:07:29,920
i think probably what they do is that
 

8235
04:07:29,920 --> 04:07:32,229
i think probably what they do is that
before they go to the gathering or

8236
04:07:32,229 --> 04:07:32,239
before they go to the gathering or
 

8237
04:07:32,239 --> 04:07:34,469
before they go to the gathering or
afterwards as well they probably go to

8238
04:07:34,469 --> 04:07:34,479
afterwards as well they probably go to
 

8239
04:07:34,479 --> 04:07:37,189
afterwards as well they probably go to
the street get some bread or get some

8240
04:07:37,189 --> 04:07:37,199
the street get some bread or get some
 

8241
04:07:37,199 --> 04:07:40,389
the street get some bread or get some
other dinner lunch whatever and then go

8244
04:07:41,429 --> 04:07:41,439
to the
 

8245
04:07:41,439 --> 04:07:42,550
to the
go to the

8246
04:07:42,550 --> 04:07:42,560
go to the
 

8247
04:07:42,560 --> 04:07:44,389
go to the

um
 

8251
04:07:45,760 --> 04:07:48,710
um
that's probably why the line was longer

8252
04:07:48,710 --> 04:07:48,720
that's probably why the line was longer
 

8253
04:07:48,720 --> 04:07:51,670
that's probably why the line was longer
than usual

8254
04:07:51,670 --> 04:07:51,680

04:07:51,680 --> 04:07:54,229

trying because it's something very

04:09:41,429 --> 04:09:41,439
trying because it's something very
 

8325
04:09:41,439 --> 04:09:44,790
trying because it's something very
popular and common in japan

04:26:48,880 --> 04:26:51,269
but i have a bad feeling because the
trains could be late so let's go

9078
04:26:51,269 --> 04:26:51,279
trains could be late so let's go
 

9079
04:26:51,279 --> 04:26:53,830
trains could be late so let's go
with the first one and the second one

with the first one and the second one
 

9081
04:26:53,840 --> 04:26:57,510
with the first one and the second one
the one that arrives too early

9082
04:26:57,510 --> 04:26:57,520
the one that arrives too early
 

9083
04:26:57,520 --> 04:26:59,030
the one that arrives too early

smart decision because our train

9088

most of the choices they had were with

13192
06:15:08,070 --> 06:15:08,080
most of the choices they had were with
 

13193
06:15:08,080 --> 06:15:10,390
most of the choices they had were with
avocados in it so

13194
06:15:10,390 --> 06:15:10,400
avocados in it so
 

13195
06:15:10,400 --> 06:15:12,310
avocados in it so
uh i chose one of the few options

13196
06:15:12,310 --> 06:15:12,320
uh i chose one of the few options
 

13197
06:15:12,320 --> 06:15:14,230
uh i chose one of the few options
without avocados because i don't like

13198
06:15:14,230 --> 06:15:14,240
without avocados because i don't like
 

13199
06:15:14,240 --> 06:15:16,310
without avocados because i don't like
avocados which is probably

13200
06:15:16,310 --> 06:15:16,320
avocados which is probably
 

13201
06:15:16,320 --> 06:15:17,990
avocados which is probably
a problem with that kind of food because

13202
06:15:17,990 --> 06:15:18,000
a problem with that kind of food because
 

13203
06:15:18,000 --> 06:15:19,830
a problem with that kind of food because
there's avocados everywhere for some

13204
06:15:19,830 --> 06:15:19,840
there's avocados everywhere for some
 

13205
06:15:19,840 --> 06:15:21,030
there's avocados everywhere for some
reason

13206
06:15:21,030 --> 06:15:21,040
reason
 

13207
06:15:21,040 --> 06:15:22,070
reason
um

13208
06:15:22,070 --> 06:15:22,080
um
 

13209
06:15:22,080 --> 06:15:24,470
um
so this this kind of aleppo i was

13210
06:15:24,470 --> 06:15:24,480
so this this kind of aleppo i was
 

13211
06:15:24,480 --> 06:15:27,270
so this this kind of aleppo i was
