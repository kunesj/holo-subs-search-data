221
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,909
to shoot not moving and not alive
targets I think oh yeah it's good to

222
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:43,919
targets I think oh yeah it's good to
 

223
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,990
targets I think oh yeah it's good to
shoot dead what not yeah

224
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:47,000
shoot dead what not yeah
 

225
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,550
shoot dead what not yeah
anyways

226
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:48,560
anyways
 

227
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,469
anyways
if you're talking about the target sheet

228
00:07:51,469 --> 00:07:51,479
if you're talking about the target sheet
 

229
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:53,390
if you're talking about the target sheet
in the back if you shoot the red spots

230
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:53,400
in the back if you shoot the red spots
 

231
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,950
in the back if you shoot the red spots
you'll be able to see like where you

232
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:54,960
you'll be able to see like where you
 

233
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,529
you'll be able to see like where you
shot it'll show up as like yellow when

234
00:07:57,529 --> 00:07:57,539
shot it'll show up as like yellow when
 

235
00:07:57,539 --> 00:07:59,270
shot it'll show up as like yellow when
you actually hit it for real it turns

236
00:07:59,270 --> 00:07:59,280
you actually hit it for real it turns
 

237
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,670
you actually hit it for real it turns
yellow yeah yeah how can it do that it's

238
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:01,680
yellow yeah yeah how can it do that it's
 

239
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,650
yellow yeah yeah how can it do that it's
because it the back side of it is yellow

240
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:03,660
because it the back side of it is yellow
 

241
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,689
because it the back side of it is yellow
I think so it just scratches off like

242
00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:05,699
I think so it just scratches off like
 

243
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:08,270
I think so it just scratches off like
the front layer but it also goes through

244
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:08,280
the front layer but it also goes through
 

245
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,309
the front layer but it also goes through
so it creates like a little a little

246
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:10,319
so it creates like a little a little
 

247
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,770
so it creates like a little a little
yeah you have a lot of shotguns down

248
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:12,780
yeah you have a lot of shotguns down
 

249
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,089
yeah you have a lot of shotguns down
there yeah

250
00:08:14,089 --> 00:08:14,099

uh shoot this one because the compressed
 

271
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,870
uh shoot this one because the compressed
air it was so heavy yeah it's heavy but

272
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:41,880
air it was so heavy yeah it's heavy but
 

273
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,170
air it was so heavy yeah it's heavy but
it also uh like it you can see that the

274
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:45,180
it also uh like it you can see that the
 

275
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,210
it also uh like it you can see that the
compressed air like kind of like a real

276
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:47,220
compressed air like kind of like a real
 

277
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,190
compressed air like kind of like a real
gun you saw the air yeah you didn't see

278
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:49,200
gun you saw the air yeah you didn't see
 

279
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,630
gun you saw the air yeah you didn't see
it I didn't see that is that right in

280
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:50,640
it I didn't see that is that right in
 

281
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,090
it I didn't see that is that right in
front of your face I felt it felt it

282
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:53,100
front of your face I felt it felt it
 

283

front of your face I felt it felt it
yeah I think that this one compared to

284
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:55,500
yeah I think that this one compared to
 

285
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,650
yeah I think that this one compared to
the electric one is kind of more similar

286
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:57,660
the electric one is kind of more similar
 

287
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,690
the electric one is kind of more similar
to shooting almost a real gun in a way

288
00:08:59,690 --> 00:08:59,700
to shooting almost a real gun in a way
 

289
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,670
to shooting almost a real gun in a way
but obviously the kickback is not as
