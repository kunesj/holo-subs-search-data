1911
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:29,270
sure but I cannot see us like finishing
the whole game together I doubt that we

1912
00:56:29,270 --> 00:56:29,280
the whole game together I doubt that we
 

1913
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:34,030
the whole game together I doubt that we
can make time so often and yeah yeah

1914
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:34,040
can make time so often and yeah yeah
 

1915
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:36,650
can make time so often and yeah yeah
especially because I want to play

1916
00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:36,660
especially because I want to play
 

1917
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:38,569
especially because I want to play
a lot of times where not everybody is

1918
00:56:38,569 --> 00:56:38,579
a lot of times where not everybody is
 

1919
00:56:38,579 --> 00:56:40,250
a lot of times where not everybody is
available so I'll probably beat the game

1920
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:40,260
available so I'll probably beat the game
 

1921
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:43,069
available so I'll probably beat the game
on my own as well I'll be available
