like 6,000 is like the
 

1251
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,669
like 6,000 is like the
guaranteed but then there's like but but

6323
02:39:13,279 --> 02:39:16,150
dear oh no it's okay A it can be
difficult like I heard that sometime the

6324
02:39:16,150 --> 02:39:16,160
difficult like I heard that sometime the
 

6325
02:39:16,160 --> 02:39:18,790
difficult like I heard that sometime the
more easy something is like is to throw

6326
02:39:18,790 --> 02:39:18,800
more easy something is like is to throw
 

6327
02:39:18,800 --> 02:39:20,750
more easy something is like is to throw
that the more difficult you know that

6328
02:39:20,750 --> 02:39:20,760
that the more difficult you know that
 

6329
02:39:20,760 --> 02:39:23,710
that the more difficult you know that
like the same concept as drawing Kirby

6330
02:39:23,710 --> 02:39:23,720
like the same concept as drawing Kirby
 

6331
02:39:23,720 --> 02:39:26,030
like the same concept as drawing Kirby
you know Kirby is so hard to draw even

6332
02:39:26,030 --> 02:39:26,040
you know Kirby is so hard to draw even
 

6333
02:39:26,040 --> 02:39:29,070
you know Kirby is so hard to draw even
if it's a just a bow right that actually

6334
02:39:29,070 --> 02:39:29,080
if it's a just a bow right that actually
 

6335
02:39:29,080 --> 02:39:31,790
if it's a just a bow right that actually
makes sense because since there's like

6336
02:39:31,790 --> 02:39:31,800
makes sense because since there's like
 

6337
02:39:31,800 --> 02:39:34,870
makes sense because since there's like
less detail I guess I don't know how to

6338
02:39:34,870 --> 02:39:34,880
less detail I guess I don't know how to
 

6339
02:39:34,880 --> 02:39:36,630
less detail I guess I don't know how to
explain it but you're you have to put

6340
02:39:36,630 --> 02:39:36,640
explain it but you're you have to put
 

6341
02:39:36,640 --> 02:39:38,510
explain it but you're you have to put
everything in the right position yeah

6342
02:39:38,510 --> 02:39:38,520
everything in the right position yeah
 

6343
02:39:38,520 --> 02:39:42,309
everything in the right position yeah
