thrown into the no yeah but I I would
 

1223
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,309
thrown into the no yeah but I I would
say that seed to Tiny plant is probably

1224
00:37:09,309 --> 00:37:09,319
say that seed to Tiny plant is probably
 

1225
00:37:09,319 --> 00:37:13,150
say that seed to Tiny plant is probably
really short time like not that big of a
