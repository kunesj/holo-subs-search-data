graphic and we see a bunny that's trying
 

1981
00:55:52,119 --> 00:55:56,349
graphic and we see a bunny that's trying
to hop to the goal on the other yeah and

1982
00:55:56,349 --> 00:55:56,359
to hop to the goal on the other yeah and
 

1983
00:55:56,359 --> 00:55:59,390
to hop to the goal on the other yeah and
it's split in three parts as you can see

1984
00:55:59,390 --> 00:55:59,400
it's split in three parts as you can see
 

1985
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:03,150
it's split in three parts as you can see
so uh we start with the wava on this

1986
00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:03,160
so uh we start with the wava on this
 

1987
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:05,029
so uh we start with the wava on this
platform I'll be holding the spoon

1988
00:56:05,029 --> 00:56:05,039
platform I'll be holding the spoon
 

1989
00:56:05,039 --> 00:56:06,910
platform I'll be holding the spoon
watching for me I'll be holding the

1990
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:06,920
watching for me I'll be holding the
 

1991
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:08,470
watching for me I'll be holding the
spoon and there will you will see there

1992
00:56:08,470 --> 00:56:08,480
spoon and there will you will see there
 

1993
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,430
spoon and there will you will see there
will be obstacles coming at me that I'll

1994
00:56:10,430 --> 00:56:10,440
will be obstacles coming at me that I'll
 

1995
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:13,309
will be obstacles coming at me that I'll
try to dodge and the spoon and the egg

1996
00:56:13,309 --> 00:56:13,319
try to dodge and the spoon and the egg
 

1997
00:56:13,319 --> 00:56:17,470
try to dodge and the spoon and the egg
has physics so if the obstacle hits the

1998
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:17,480
has physics so if the obstacle hits the
 

1999
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:19,549
has physics so if the obstacle hits the
egg the egg will drop and the bunny will

2000
00:56:19,549 --> 00:56:19,559
egg the egg will drop and the bunny will

we have to do this three times until the
 

2005
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:29,309
we have to do this three times until the
bunny reaches a free time successfully

2006

immediately it will go to the middle
 

2013
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:37,670
immediately it will go to the middle
stage which is you

2014
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:37,680
stage which is you

2035
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,430
a question I'll move on to the answer if
you got it right then there'll be a

2036
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:07,440
you got it right then there'll be a
 

2037
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,630
you got it right then there'll be a
right or a wrong ding ding ding

spoon maybe the you can see

2102
00:58:46,109 --> 00:58:46,119
spoon maybe the you can see
 

2103
00:58:46,119 --> 00:58:48,990

a rock scissors paper but there's only
 

2591
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:37,550
a rock scissors paper but there's only
two options I guess over here follow me

2592
01:11:37,550 --> 01:11:37,560
two options I guess over here follow me
 

2593
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:38,669
two options I guess over here follow me
if you

2594
01:11:38,669 --> 01:11:38,679
if you
 

2595
01:11:38,679 --> 01:11:41,990
if you
want over here there's the eggs that we

2596
01:11:41,990 --> 01:11:42,000
want over here there's the eggs that we
 

2597
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:47,149

it you look at them you see if you have

2608
01:12:00,910 --> 01:12:00,920
it you look at them you see if you have
 

2609
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:03,030
it you look at them you see if you have
a connection with the egg then you take

2610
01:12:03,030 --> 01:12:03,040
a connection with the egg then you take
 

2611
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:06,189
a connection with the egg then you take
it to the boxing ring and then you will

2612
01:12:06,189 --> 01:12:06,199
it to the boxing ring and then you will
 

2613
01:12:06,199 --> 01:12:08,669
it to the boxing ring and then you will
face your opponent and we'll see which

2614
01:12:08,669 --> 01:12:08,679
face your opponent and we'll see which
 

2615
01:12:08,679 --> 01:12:10,669
face your opponent and we'll see which
egg was the stronger one just for the

2616
01:12:10,669 --> 01:12:10,679
egg was the stronger one just for the
 

2617
01:12:10,679 --> 01:12:12,629
egg was the stronger one just for the
audience who understand these eggs have

2618
01:12:12,629 --> 01:12:12,639
audience who understand these eggs have
 

2619
01:12:12,639 --> 01:12:15,629
audience who understand these eggs have
randomly assigned stats to them some are

2620
01:12:15,629 --> 01:12:15,639
randomly assigned stats to them some are
 

2621
01:12:15,639 --> 01:12:17,149
randomly assigned stats to them some are
already decided to be stronger than

2622
01:12:17,149 --> 01:12:17,159
already decided to be stronger than
 

2623
01:12:17,159 --> 01:12:19,430

2629
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:29,390
we'll see who gets the right egg and who
wins to be the expert 2024 one's really

2630
01:12:29,390 --> 01:12:29,400
wins to be the expert 2024 one's really
 

2631
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:32,070
wins to be the expert 2024 one's really
