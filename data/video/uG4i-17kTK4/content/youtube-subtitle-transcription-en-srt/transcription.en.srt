several moves where um we would kind of
 

1740
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,870
several moves where um we would kind of
do a very similar movement but the

timings where we would do it were just
 

1744
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:42,190
timings where we would do it were just
very slightly one beat off like one of

1846
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:16,950
like if I want her to be in my like
birthday frd for example that I get only

1847
00:58:16,950 --> 00:58:16,960
birthday frd for example that I get only
 

1848
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,349
birthday frd for example that I get only
once in a year then she has to be able

1849
00:58:19,349 --> 00:58:19,359
once in a year then she has to be able
 

1850
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:21,230
once in a year then she has to be able
in Japan otherwise it's not going to

1851
00:58:21,230 --> 00:58:21,240
in Japan otherwise it's not going to
 

1852
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:23,710
in Japan otherwise it's not going to
work out right

1853
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:23,720
work out right
 

1854
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:26,190
work out right
so

1855
00:58:26,190 --> 00:58:26,200
so
 

1856
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:28,549
so
chance is probably

1857
00:58:28,549 --> 00:58:28,559
chance is probably
 

1858
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:31,789
chance is probably
generally kind of

1859
00:58:31,789 --> 00:58:31,799
generally kind of
 

1860
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:34,230

and this is a cool thing that I already
 

13153
06:22:10,638 --> 06:22:16,190
and this is a cool thing that I already
saw before um from AOE players um maybe

eventually I'll pick up this strategy

13156
06:22:18,430 --> 06:22:18,440
eventually I'll pick up this strategy
 

13157
06:22:18,440 --> 06:22:22,150
eventually I'll pick up this strategy
too but like when people are um like

13158
06:22:22,150 --> 06:22:22,160
too but like when people are um like
 

13159

something up really quickly what you can

13164
06:22:29,190 --> 06:22:29,200
something up really quickly what you can
 

13165
06:22:29,200 --> 06:22:31,868
something up really quickly what you can
do is if you have a villager close by

13166
06:22:31,868 --> 06:22:31,878
do is if you have a villager close by
 

13167
06:22:31,878 --> 06:22:33,868
do is if you have a villager close by
doesn't even have to be close by I think

13168
06:22:33,868 --> 06:22:33,878
doesn't even have to be close by I think
 

13169
06:22:33,878 --> 06:22:36,830
doesn't even have to be close by I think
you just make them build a house or any

you just make them build a house or any
 

13171
06:22:36,840 --> 06:22:40,310
you just make them build a house or any
kind of building there and already when

13172
06:22:40,310 --> 06:22:40,320
kind of building there and already when
 

13173
06:22:40,320 --> 06:22:42,110
kind of building there and already when

worth it cuz he was already seeing most

13228
06:23:59,310 --> 06:23:59,320
worth it cuz he was already seeing most
 

13229
06:23:59,320 --> 06:24:03,270
worth it cuz he was already seeing most
of the

13230
06:24:03,270 --> 06:24:03,280

 

13231
06:24:03,280 --> 06:24:05,390

map yeah these people play these games

13232
06:24:05,390 --> 06:24:05,400
map yeah these people play these games
 

13233
06:24:05,400 --> 06:24:06,990
map yeah these people play these games
for years and years yeah but then I

13234
06:24:06,990 --> 06:24:07,000
for years and years yeah but then I
 

13235
06:24:07,000 --> 06:24:09,070
for years and years yeah but then I
think about Ellie and it gives me hope

13236
06:24:09,070 --> 06:24:09,080
think about Ellie and it gives me hope
 

13237
06:24:09,080 --> 06:24:11,628
think about Ellie and it gives me hope
because uh she said she only started

13238
06:24:11,628 --> 06:24:11,638
because uh she said she only started
 

13239
06:24:11,638 --> 06:24:14,868
because uh she said she only started
with the pandemic and then even then

13240
06:24:14,868 --> 06:24:14,878
with the pandemic and then even then
 

13241
06:24:14,878 --> 06:24:18,750
with the pandemic and then even then
she's been mostly casting for a while

13242
06:24:18,750 --> 06:24:18,760
she's been mostly casting for a while
 

13243
06:24:18,760 --> 06:24:23,030
she's been mostly casting for a while
now so it's not that much time that she

13244
06:24:23,030 --> 06:24:23,040
now so it's not that much time that she
 

13245
06:24:23,040 --> 06:24:27,468
now so it's not that much time that she
put into the game after actually maybe

13246
06:24:27,468 --> 06:24:27,478
put into the game after actually maybe
 

13247
06:24:27,478 --> 06:24:30,948
put into the game after actually maybe
one or 2 years that she played

13248
06:24:30,948 --> 06:24:30,958
one or 2 years that she played
 

13249
06:24:30,958 --> 06:24:34,430
