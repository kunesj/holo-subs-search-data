no, Grenadier.  It's a neat and clean name, but when you get to know it, you're a customer who saves water. That's how long you should wait. It's
not good, is it? There are some

people who are not good.
 

758
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:49,510
people who are not good.
Even in the base game, it's more about living than Hatayama-chan. I

There are differences in the sex selection, but it's

invited the sweater to my house and didn't tell him about it. That's so

791
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:54,720
invited the sweater to my house and didn't tell him about it. That's so
 

792
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,480
invited the sweater to my house and didn't tell him about it. That's so
rude. It looks like we're going to fight, so I'm a good kid.

793
00:27:59,480 --> 00:27:59,490
rude. It looks like we're going to fight, so I'm a good kid.

various things, Mengqiarzu.  I think I probably wouldn't have been found out if I hadn't said anything. I'm

799
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:32,830

sure I'd be able to get away with it. I wrote "Are-kaa-san" when I was a kid and I'm also looking at Twitter and stuff, but I'm really not good at it. I'm

not good at taking baths.  It's

00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:39,049
not good at taking baths.  It's
 

803
00:28:39,049 --> 00:28:45,249
not good at taking baths.  It's
not like the usual "your illustrations are good" kind of thing. It's a

00:28:45,249 --> 00:28:45,259
not like the usual "your illustrations are good" kind of thing. It's a
 

805
00:28:45,259 --> 00:28:46,749
not like the usual "your illustrations are good" kind of thing. It's a
different material. It's much

806
00:28:46,749 --> 00:28:46,759
different material. It's much
 

807
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:53,769
different material. It's much
more like "let's have some tea" than the Janeno that I asked to bring it.

808
00:28:53,769 --> 00:28:53,779
more like "let's have some tea" than the Janeno that I asked to bring it.
