1436
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:45,240
I can't figure out what it is and at
 

1437
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,230
I can't figure out what it is and at

1443
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:56,270
let's do the vaccines later because
we're gonna like try to figure out this

1444
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:56,280
we're gonna like try to figure out this
 

1445
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,349
we're gonna like try to figure out this
issue first they didn't want to do both

1446
00:40:58,349 --> 00:40:58,359
issue first they didn't want to do both
 

1447
00:40:58,359 --> 00:40:59,990
issue first they didn't want to do both
of them at this both of these issues at

1448
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:00,000
of them at this both of these issues at
 

1449
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,710
of them at this both of these issues at
the same time because the vaccines can

1450
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:01,720
the same time because the vaccines can
 

1451
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,910
the same time because the vaccines can
make them kind of weak and stuff for a

1452
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:04,920
make them kind of weak and stuff for a
 

1453
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,670
make them kind of weak and stuff for a
day or so I guess and they said like

day or so I guess and they said like
 

1455
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,069
day or so I guess and they said like
just bring them back for the vaccines

1456
00:41:10,069 --> 00:41:10,079
just bring them back for the vaccines
 

1457

repeat this and throw her right on nanoa

repeat this and throw her right on nanoa
 

2829
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:20,870

like one of these or throw her on the

worked I wonder if I should do it

01:21:14,830 --> 01:21:14,840
worked I wonder if I should do it
 

2905
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:21,990

have I I don't know how to throw it so
 

2931
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:02,350

that she will stay there cuz you know

line like if I throw it here it will

2936
01:22:07,870 --> 01:22:07,880
line like if I throw it here it will
 

2937
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:09,870

just the throw will be too straight and

2938
01:22:09,870 --> 01:22:09,880
just the throw will be too straight and
 

2939
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:11,229
just the throw will be too straight and
there's a high chance over is that it

2940
01:22:11,229 --> 01:22:11,239
there's a high chance over is that it
 

2941
01:22:11,239 --> 01:22:13,709
there's a high chance over is that it
will bounce off and fall down so I need

2942
01:22:13,709 --> 01:22:13,719
will bounce off and fall down so I need
 

2943
01:22:13,719 --> 01:22:15,270
will bounce off and fall down so I need
to throw it higher but if I throw it

2944
01:22:15,270 --> 01:22:15,280
to throw it higher but if I throw it
 

2945
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:19,030
to throw it higher but if I throw it
higher then there's more like momentum

2946
01:22:19,030 --> 01:22:19,040
higher then there's more like momentum
 

2947
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:20,750
higher then there's more like momentum
and it might like bounce over there to

2948
01:22:20,750 --> 01:22:20,760
and it might like bounce over there to
 

2949
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:24,189
and it might like bounce over there to
