5196
02:36:46,910 --> 02:36:46,920
then let the F3 well I would probably do
 

5197
02:36:46,920 --> 02:36:50,090
then let the F3 well I would probably do
it like that too yeah but it's like

5198
02:36:50,090 --> 02:36:50,100
it like that too yeah but it's like
 

5199

it like that too yeah but it's like
slower actually if you can differentiate

slower actually if you can differentiate
 

5201
02:36:53,160 --> 02:36:56,690
slower actually if you can differentiate
it with your yeah your eyes yeah it's

5202

05:13:58,610 --> 05:13:58,620
accents it's not a suit I think those
 

10951
05:13:58,620 --> 05:14:00,350
accents it's not a suit I think those
are the straps yeah

10952
05:14:00,350 --> 05:14:00,360
are the straps yeah
 

10953
05:14:00,360 --> 05:14:01,970
are the straps yeah
but that one works apparently and then

10954
05:14:01,970 --> 05:14:01,980
but that one works apparently and then
 

10955
05:14:01,980 --> 05:14:05,208
but that one works apparently and then
combine it with the meta gloves that are

10956
05:14:05,208 --> 05:14:05,218
combine it with the meta gloves that are
 

10957
05:14:05,218 --> 05:14:07,070
combine it with the meta gloves that are
6 000 Euro

10958
05:14:07,070 --> 05:14:07,080
6 000 Euro
 

10959
05:14:07,080 --> 05:14:10,670
6 000 Euro
the gloves are more expensive than the

10960
05:14:10,670 --> 05:14:10,680
the gloves are more expensive than the
 

10961
05:14:10,680 --> 05:14:13,430
the gloves are more expensive than the
whole body trick

10962
05:14:13,430 --> 05:14:13,440
whole body trick
 

10963
05:14:13,440 --> 05:14:16,070
whole body trick
gloves you know it's it's a thing with

10964
05:14:16,070 --> 05:14:16,080
gloves you know it's it's a thing with
 

10965
05:14:16,080 --> 05:14:19,310
gloves you know it's it's a thing with
motion capture gloves tend to be very

10966
05:14:19,310 --> 05:14:19,320
motion capture gloves tend to be very
 

10967
05:14:19,320 --> 05:14:22,250
motion capture gloves tend to be very
expensive for every motion capture

10968
05:14:22,250 --> 05:14:22,260
expensive for every motion capture
 

10969
05:14:22,260 --> 05:14:23,208
expensive for every motion capture
solution

10970
05:14:23,208 --> 05:14:23,218
solution
 

10971
05:14:23,218 --> 05:14:25,610
solution
so six thousand plus four thousand two

10972
05:14:25,610 --> 05:14:25,620
so six thousand plus four thousand two
 

10973
05:14:25,620 --> 05:14:29,530
so six thousand plus four thousand two
hundred which is already over a 10K 10

10974
05:14:29,530 --> 05:14:29,540
hundred which is already over a 10K 10
 

10975
05:14:29,540 --> 05:14:32,208
hundred which is already over a 10K 10
200 euro

10976
05:14:32,208 --> 05:14:32,218
200 euro
 

10977
05:14:32,218 --> 05:14:35,628
200 euro
and then we need software

10978
05:14:35,628 --> 05:14:35,638
and then we need software
 

10979
05:14:35,638 --> 05:14:38,868
and then we need software
and there's one that I need for

10980
05:14:38,868 --> 05:14:38,878
and there's one that I need for
 

10981
05:14:38,878 --> 05:14:40,970
and there's one that I need for
streaming

10982
05:14:40,970 --> 05:14:40,980
streaming
 

10983
05:14:40,980 --> 05:14:44,208
streaming
which is either 2500 per year

10984
05:14:44,208 --> 05:14:44,218
which is either 2500 per year
 

10985
05:14:44,218 --> 05:14:48,470
which is either 2500 per year
or 250 per month every month cancelable

10986
05:14:48,470 --> 05:14:48,480
or 250 per month every month cancelable
 

10987
05:14:48,480 --> 05:14:50,990
or 250 per month every month cancelable
and I don't think I'll be doing a stream

10988
05:14:50,990 --> 05:14:51,000
and I don't think I'll be doing a stream
 

10989
05:14:51,000 --> 05:14:52,670
and I don't think I'll be doing a stream
every

10990
05:14:52,670 --> 05:14:52,680
every
 

10991
05:14:52,680 --> 05:14:54,830
every
month and a whole year so I think I'll

10992
05:14:54,830 --> 05:14:54,840
month and a whole year so I think I'll
 

10993
05:14:54,840 --> 05:14:57,470
month and a whole year so I think I'll
just go for the monthly plan first

10994
05:14:57,470 --> 05:14:57,480
just go for the monthly plan first
 

10995
05:14:57,480 --> 05:15:03,250
just go for the monthly plan first
so 250 per month where I want to use it

10996
05:15:03,250 --> 05:15:03,260

 

10997
05:15:03,260 --> 05:15:06,110

for the streaming part and then for

10998
05:15:06,110 --> 05:15:06,120
for the streaming part and then for
 

10999
05:15:06,120 --> 05:15:09,050
for the streaming part and then for
other things

11000
05:15:09,050 --> 05:15:09,060

 

11001
05:15:09,060 --> 05:15:13,490

I think I need this too there's one

11002
05:15:13,490 --> 05:15:13,500
I think I need this too there's one
 

11003
05:15:13,500 --> 05:15:16,010
I think I need this too there's one
there's one software that I have which

11004
05:15:16,010 --> 05:15:16,020
there's one software that I have which
 

11005
05:15:16,020 --> 05:15:18,770
there's one software that I have which
is like the pro version which is

11006
05:15:18,770 --> 05:15:18,780
is like the pro version which is
 

11007
05:15:18,780 --> 05:15:21,650
is like the pro version which is
10 000 per year and there is no monthly

11008
05:15:21,650 --> 05:15:21,660
10 000 per year and there is no monthly
 

11009
05:15:21,660 --> 05:15:24,410
10 000 per year and there is no monthly
subscription you have to pay per year 10

11010
05:15:24,410 --> 05:15:24,420
subscription you have to pay per year 10
 

11011
05:15:24,420 --> 05:15:25,490
subscription you have to pay per year 10
000 per year

11012
05:15:25,490 --> 05:15:25,500
000 per year
 

11013
05:15:25,500 --> 05:15:27,830
000 per year
and the cheaper one which kanado told me

11014
05:15:27,830 --> 05:15:27,840
and the cheaper one which kanado told me
 

11015
05:15:27,840 --> 05:15:29,930
and the cheaper one which kanado told me
I only need the cheaper one

11016
05:15:29,930 --> 05:15:29,940
I only need the cheaper one
 

11017
05:15:29,940 --> 05:15:32,208
I only need the cheaper one
is three thousand

11018
05:15:32,208 --> 05:15:32,218
is three thousand
 

11019
05:15:32,218 --> 05:15:33,830
is three thousand
per year

11020
05:15:33,830 --> 05:15:33,840
per year
 

11021
05:15:33,840 --> 05:15:38,270
per year
so basically we we come down to uh it

11022
05:15:38,270 --> 05:15:38,280
so basically we we come down to uh it
 

11023
05:15:38,280 --> 05:15:41,930
so basically we we come down to uh it
was 10 250 plus three thousand so

11024
05:15:41,930 --> 05:15:41,940
was 10 250 plus three thousand so
 

11025
05:15:41,940 --> 05:15:44,448
was 10 250 plus three thousand so
thirteen thousand two hundred fifty

11026
05:15:44,448 --> 05:15:44,458
thirteen thousand two hundred fifty
 

11027
05:15:44,458 --> 05:15:49,128
thirteen thousand two hundred fifty
at 230. 14 230 plus if I want to stream

11028
05:15:49,128 --> 05:15:49,138
at 230. 14 230 plus if I want to stream
 

11029
05:15:49,138 --> 05:15:52,128
at 230. 14 230 plus if I want to stream
in that month it will be a number 250.

11030
05:15:52,128 --> 05:15:52,138
in that month it will be a number 250.
 

11031
05:15:52,138 --> 05:15:53,570
in that month it will be a number 250.
so

11032
05:15:53,570 --> 05:15:53,580
so
 

11033
05:15:53,580 --> 05:15:55,850
so
like fourteen thousand

11034
05:15:55,850 --> 05:15:55,860
like fourteen thousand
 

11035
05:15:55,860 --> 05:15:58,670
like fourteen thousand
but thirteen thousand around thirteen

11036
05:15:58,670 --> 05:15:58,680
but thirteen thousand around thirteen
 

11037
05:15:58,680 --> 05:16:01,610
but thirteen thousand around thirteen
thousand euro is like

11038
05:16:01,610 --> 05:16:01,620
thousand euro is like
 

11039
05:16:01,620 --> 05:16:02,750
thousand euro is like
um

11040
05:16:02,750 --> 05:16:02,760
um
 

11041
05:16:02,760 --> 05:16:04,550
um
for one year

11042
05:16:04,550 --> 05:16:04,560
for one year
 

11043
05:16:04,560 --> 05:16:09,530
for one year
so we can split it per month I guess

11044
05:16:09,530 --> 05:16:09,540

 

11045
05:16:09,540 --> 05:16:12,650

13 000 for a year of having this suit

11046
05:16:12,650 --> 05:16:12,660
13 000 for a year of having this suit
 

11047
05:16:12,660 --> 05:16:14,750
13 000 for a year of having this suit
with the software

11048
05:16:14,750 --> 05:16:14,760
with the software
 

11049
05:16:14,760 --> 05:16:16,610
with the software
and for every month I want to use it for

11050
05:16:16,610 --> 05:16:16,620
and for every month I want to use it for
 

11051
05:16:16,620 --> 05:16:17,810
and for every month I want to use it for
streaming and not for like YouTube

11052
05:16:17,810 --> 05:16:17,820
streaming and not for like YouTube
 

11053
05:16:17,820 --> 05:16:20,510
streaming and not for like YouTube
shorts or MV or whatever

11054
05:16:20,510 --> 05:16:20,520
shorts or MV or whatever
 

11055
05:16:20,520 --> 05:16:23,150
shorts or MV or whatever
we add a number 250.

11056
05:16:23,150 --> 05:16:23,160
we add a number 250.
 

11057
05:16:23,160 --> 05:16:26,448
we add a number 250.
about 1K a month right yeah it's like 1K

11058
05:16:26,448 --> 05:16:26,458
about 1K a month right yeah it's like 1K
 

11059
05:16:26,458 --> 05:16:27,830
about 1K a month right yeah it's like 1K
per month

11060
05:16:27,830 --> 05:16:27,840
per month
 

11061
05:16:27,840 --> 05:16:31,550
per month
now I can also write this off but I

11062
05:16:31,550 --> 05:16:31,560
now I can also write this off but I
 

11063
05:16:31,560 --> 05:16:33,770
now I can also write this off but I
don't know how much of this

11064
05:16:33,770 --> 05:16:33,780
don't know how much of this
 

11065
05:16:33,780 --> 05:16:36,288
don't know how much of this
could be written off how much of it is

11066
05:16:36,288 --> 05:16:36,298
could be written off how much of it is
 

11067
05:16:36,298 --> 05:16:40,010
could be written off how much of it is
taxes

11068
05:16:40,010 --> 05:16:40,020

 

11069
05:16:40,020 --> 05:16:42,170

but yeah if you calculated like that I

11070
05:16:42,170 --> 05:16:42,180
but yeah if you calculated like that I
 

11071
05:16:42,180 --> 05:16:44,690
but yeah if you calculated like that I
guess it's about roughly a little bit

11072
05:16:44,690 --> 05:16:44,700
guess it's about roughly a little bit
 

11073
05:16:44,700 --> 05:16:49,490
guess it's about roughly a little bit
more than you know 1.3 k a month hmm

11074
05:16:49,490 --> 05:16:49,500

 

11075
05:16:49,500 --> 05:16:50,680

external Studios and I'm waiting to hear

11130
05:18:11,090 --> 05:18:11,100
external Studios and I'm waiting to hear
 

11131
05:18:11,100 --> 05:18:14,030
external Studios and I'm waiting to hear
back for how much it costs at external

11132
05:18:14,030 --> 05:18:14,040
back for how much it costs at external
 

11133
05:18:14,040 --> 05:18:15,470
back for how much it costs at external
Studios

11134
05:18:15,470 --> 05:18:15,480
Studios
 

11135
05:18:15,480 --> 05:18:17,570
Studios
and if it's not too expensive then I

11136
05:18:17,570 --> 05:18:17,580
and if it's not too expensive then I
 

11137
05:18:17,580 --> 05:18:20,448
and if it's not too expensive then I
might just use the external Studio but

11138
05:18:20,448 --> 05:18:20,458
might just use the external Studio but
 

11139
05:18:20,458 --> 05:18:22,490
might just use the external Studio but
this would give me the the freedom to

11140
05:18:22,490 --> 05:18:22,500
this would give me the the freedom to
 

11141
05:18:22,500 --> 05:18:25,070
this would give me the the freedom to
use it whenever I want you know at home

11142
05:18:25,070 --> 05:18:25,080
use it whenever I want you know at home
 

11143

05:18:31,250 --> 05:18:31,260
so I feel like yeah it might actually
 

11147
05:18:31,260 --> 05:18:35,090
so I feel like yeah it might actually

05:19:51,958 --> 05:19:55,190
and stuff right so it's not so important
for her to have better quality

11208
05:19:55,190 --> 05:19:55,200
for her to have better quality
 

11209

11213
05:20:01,080 --> 05:20:03,170
look at his stuff and I think it looks
plenty good

11214
05:20:03,170 --> 05:20:03,180
plenty good
 

11215
05:20:03,180 --> 05:20:07,190
plenty good
um

11216
05:20:07,190 --> 05:20:07,200

 

11217
05:20:07,200 --> 05:20:09,770

oh she has the whole suit

11218
05:20:09,770 --> 05:20:09,780

11220
05:20:13,128 --> 05:20:13,138

 

11221
05:20:13,138 --> 05:20:14,750

oh

11222
05:20:14,750 --> 05:20:14,760

know
 

11227
05:20:17,458 --> 05:20:19,610
know
so judging by that I think it's okay to

11228
05:20:19,610 --> 05:20:19,620
so judging by that I think it's okay to
 

11229
05:20:19,620 --> 05:20:24,590
so judging by that I think it's okay to
just get the the minimum and maybe maybe

11230
05:20:24,590 --> 05:20:24,600
just get the the minimum and maybe maybe
 

11231
05:20:24,600 --> 05:20:27,050
just get the the minimum and maybe maybe
the honestly I feel like if I spend so

11232
05:20:27,050 --> 05:20:27,060
the honestly I feel like if I spend so
 

11233
05:20:27,060 --> 05:20:28,610
the honestly I feel like if I spend so
much money they would probably be open

11234
05:20:28,610 --> 05:20:28,620
much money they would probably be open

tried it can't be that difficult it's
surely also tutorials and you know I

11442
05:25:41,270 --> 05:25:41,280
surely also tutorials and you know I

like camera setups new
 

11447
05:25:48,600 --> 05:25:50,930
like camera setups new

the software

11452
05:25:53,990 --> 05:25:54,000
the software
 

11453
05:25:54,000 --> 05:26:00,110
the software
I I think there's tutorials for that too

11454
05:26:00,110 --> 05:26:00,120

 

11455
05:26:00,120 --> 05:26:02,810

the other Home 3D to work before too
 

11461
05:26:09,240 --> 05:26:12,470
the other Home 3D to work before too
so this one I will make it work to

11462
05:26:12,470 --> 05:26:12,480
so this one I will make it work to
 

11463

New Zealand Maybe

13140
06:08:26,330 --> 06:08:26,340

 

13141
06:08:26,340 --> 06:08:28,070

they would probably immediately close

13142
06:08:28,070 --> 06:08:28,080
they would probably immediately close
 

13143
06:08:28,080 --> 06:08:30,350
they would probably immediately close

13144
06:08:30,350 --> 06:08:30,360
down again if they got a new case like
 

13145
06:08:30,360 --> 06:08:32,448
down again if they got a new case like

13146
06:08:32,448 --> 06:08:32,458
sometimes we managed to get down to zero
 

13147
06:08:32,458 --> 06:08:35,150
sometimes we managed to get down to zero
right zero cases

13148
06:08:35,150 --> 06:08:35,160
right zero cases
 

13149
06:08:35,160 --> 06:08:38,868
right zero cases
Madagascar

13150
06:08:38,868 --> 06:08:38,878

 

13151
06:08:38,878 --> 06:08:40,610

if and then the one I heard about was

13152
06:08:40,610 --> 06:08:40,620
if and then the one I heard about was
 

13153
06:08:40,620 --> 06:08:43,070

New Zealand I think yeah

13155
06:08:43,080 --> 06:08:46,050

so I feel like they would probably close
 

13161
06:08:52,440 --> 06:08:55,788
so I feel like they would probably close
