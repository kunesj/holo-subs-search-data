build it on the plot of land

4044
01:42:27,189 --> 01:42:27,199
build it on the plot of land
 

4045
01:42:27,199 --> 01:42:30,510
build it on the plot of land
easily especially because we have you

4046
01:42:30,510 --> 01:42:30,520
easily especially because we have you
 

4047
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:33,470

know a not Unlimited Supply of blocks

4048
01:42:33,470 --> 01:42:33,480
know a not Unlimited Supply of blocks
 

4049
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:38,030
know a not Unlimited Supply of blocks
and I will have to craft them so it is

4050
01:42:38,030 --> 01:42:38,040
and I will have to craft them so it is
 

4051
01:42:38,040 --> 01:42:40,109
and I will have to craft them so it is
very important that I have sketched it

4052
01:42:40,109 --> 01:42:40,119
very important that I have sketched it
 

4053
01:42:40,119 --> 01:42:43,149
very important that I have sketched it
out before I build
