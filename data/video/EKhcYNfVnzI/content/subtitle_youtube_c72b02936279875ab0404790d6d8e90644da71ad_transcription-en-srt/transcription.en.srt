so now i changed it back but i realized
during the

66
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:47,440
during the
 

67
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,070

during the manga stream i was thinking i
 

69
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,190
during the manga stream i was thinking i
should

70
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:51,200

71
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,710
should
the staff might have changed some of my

72
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:52,720
the staff might have changed some of my
 

73
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,710
the staff might have changed some of my
settings so maybe that's the cause

74
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:54,720
settings so maybe that's the cause
 

75
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,270
settings so maybe that's the cause
but like it's a setting that i couldn't

think
 

1615
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,030
think
we both actually didn't really practice

1616
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:17,040
we both actually didn't really practice
 

1617
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:17,910
we both actually didn't really practice
because both of

1618
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:17,920
because both of
 

1619
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,309
because both of
those songs are songs we both sing very

1620
00:48:20,309 --> 00:48:20,319
those songs are songs we both sing very
 

1621
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:21,349
those songs are songs we both sing very
often

1622

often
 

1623
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:22,870
often
so there wasn't really any practice

1624
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:22,880
so there wasn't really any practice
 

1625
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,670
so there wasn't really any practice
necessary but before the stream

1626
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:25,680
necessary but before the stream
 

1627
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,790

when we were in the studio we we

1628
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:28,800
when we were in the studio we we
 

1629
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,790
when we were in the studio we we
practiced it a few times and tried to

1630
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:30,800
practiced it a few times and tried to
 

1631
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:31,670
practiced it a few times and tried to
like

1632
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:31,680

1635
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,990

beginning
 

1641
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,670

because i sang the wrong part in the

00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:43,680
because i sang the wrong part in the
 

1643
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,109

3983
02:03:29,360 --> 02:03:30,470
so if it's a collab like with subaru
senpai where both

3984
02:03:30,470 --> 02:03:30,480
senpai where both
 

3985
02:03:30,480 --> 02:03:33,669
senpai where both
personalities are like really energetic

3986
02:03:33,669 --> 02:03:33,679
personalities are like really energetic
 

3987
02:03:33,679 --> 02:03:36,629
personalities are like really energetic
everyone talks a lot and we play a game

3988
02:03:36,629 --> 02:03:36,639
everyone talks a lot and we play a game
 

3989
02:03:36,639 --> 02:03:38,310
everyone talks a lot and we play a game
where you talk a lot

3990
02:03:38,310 --> 02:03:38,320
where you talk a lot
 

3991
02:03:38,320 --> 02:03:41,990
where you talk a lot
and then there's not really

3992
02:03:41,990 --> 02:03:42,000
and then there's not really
 

3993
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:46,470
and then there's not really
any time to translate for me

3994
02:03:46,470 --> 02:03:46,480
any time to translate for me
 

3995
02:03:46,480 --> 02:03:48,550
any time to translate for me
so if it's a stream like with super the

3996
02:03:48,550 --> 02:03:48,560
so if it's a stream like with super the
 

3997
02:03:48,560 --> 02:03:49,589
so if it's a stream like with super the
senpai i will not

3998
02:03:49,589 --> 02:03:49,599
senpai i will not
 

3999
02:03:49,599 --> 02:03:52,229
senpai i will not
translate and maybe like only a little

4000
02:03:52,229 --> 02:03:52,239
translate and maybe like only a little
 

4001
02:03:52,239 --> 02:03:53,669
translate and maybe like only a little
bit in between

4002
02:03:53,669 --> 02:03:53,679
bit in between
 

4003
02:03:53,679 --> 02:03:56,709
bit in between
well like at the introduction and so on

4004
02:03:56,709 --> 02:03:56,719
well like at the introduction and so on
 

4005
02:03:56,719 --> 02:03:59,350
well like at the introduction and so on
but other other than that i know it's uh

4006
02:03:59,350 --> 02:03:59,360
but other other than that i know it's uh
 

4007
02:03:59,360 --> 02:04:01,270
but other other than that i know it's uh
funny because the super chat back then

4008
02:04:01,270 --> 02:04:01,280
funny because the super chat back then
 

4009
02:04:01,280 --> 02:04:03,109
funny because the super chat back then
that made me cry

4010
02:04:03,109 --> 02:04:03,119
that made me cry
 

4011
02:04:03,119 --> 02:04:05,189
that made me cry
said it but that actually does ruin the

4012
02:04:05,189 --> 02:04:05,199
said it but that actually does ruin the
 

4013
02:04:05,199 --> 02:04:07,109
said it but that actually does ruin the
flow i agree with that

4014
02:04:07,109 --> 02:04:07,119
flow i agree with that
 

4015
02:04:07,119 --> 02:04:10,950
flow i agree with that
uh so yeah but if it's a

4016
02:04:10,950 --> 02:04:10,960
uh so yeah but if it's a
 

4017
02:04:10,960 --> 02:04:14,229
uh so yeah but if it's a
if it's a stream with like uh like the

4018
02:04:14,229 --> 02:04:14,239
if it's a stream with like uh like the
 

4019
02:04:14,239 --> 02:04:15,750
if it's a stream with like uh like the
one with nana

4020
02:04:15,750 --> 02:04:15,760
one with nana
 

4021
02:04:15,760 --> 02:04:17,750
one with nana
where we were mostly singing and the

4022
02:04:17,750 --> 02:04:17,760
where we were mostly singing and the
 

4023
02:04:17,760 --> 02:04:19,910
where we were mostly singing and the
talking isn't that much so i have enough

4024
02:04:19,910 --> 02:04:19,920
talking isn't that much so i have enough
 

4025
02:04:19,920 --> 02:04:21,669
talking isn't that much so i have enough
time to translate it and it's

4026
02:04:21,669 --> 02:04:21,679
time to translate it and it's
 

4027
02:04:21,679 --> 02:04:23,910
time to translate it and it's
it doesn't really ruin the flow and when

4028
02:04:23,910 --> 02:04:23,920
it doesn't really ruin the flow and when
 

4029
02:04:23,920 --> 02:04:24,870
it doesn't really ruin the flow and when
a nanotub

4030
02:04:24,870 --> 02:04:24,880
a nanotub
 

4031
02:04:24,880 --> 02:04:26,629
a nanotub
is energetic but maybe a bit less

4032
02:04:26,629 --> 02:04:26,639
is energetic but maybe a bit less
 

4033
02:04:26,639 --> 02:04:28,870
is energetic but maybe a bit less
energetic than super senpai

4034
02:04:28,870 --> 02:04:28,880
energetic than super senpai
 

4035
02:04:28,880 --> 02:04:33,750
energetic than super senpai
so it worked fine in that case

4036
02:04:33,750 --> 02:04:33,760
so it worked fine in that case
 

4037
02:04:33,760 --> 02:04:37,990
so it worked fine in that case
and um so if it's a stream like that

4038
02:04:37,990 --> 02:04:38,000
and um so if it's a stream like that
 

4039
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:41,109
and um so if it's a stream like that
where it's not hundred percent talking

4040
02:04:41,109 --> 02:04:41,119
where it's not hundred percent talking
 

4041
02:04:41,119 --> 02:04:44,550
where it's not hundred percent talking
then i will translate

4042
02:04:44,550 --> 02:04:44,560

 

4043
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:48,310

02:04:48,310 --> 02:04:48,320
as much as possible so that uh the fans
 

4045
02:04:48,320 --> 02:04:51,669
as much as possible so that uh the fans
