not indoctrinate them
 

1703

will they age

will they age
 

1705
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,870
will they age
because if we keep them there forever

because if we keep them there forever

seven months ago i could have already

4282
01:53:41,030 --> 01:53:41,040
seven months ago i could have already
 

4283
01:53:41,040 --> 01:53:43,189
seven months ago i could have already
went to the neurologist ages ago because

4284
01:53:43,189 --> 01:53:43,199
went to the neurologist ages ago because
 

4285
01:53:43,199 --> 01:53:44,390
went to the neurologist ages ago because
neurologists

4286
01:53:44,390 --> 01:53:44,400
neurologists
 

4287
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:46,149
neurologists
there's a lot of them unusually don't

4288
01:53:46,149 --> 01:53:46,159
there's a lot of them unusually don't
 

4289
01:53:46,159 --> 01:53:49,189
there's a lot of them unusually don't
have that much waiting time i think

4290
01:53:49,189 --> 01:53:49,199
have that much waiting time i think
 

4291
01:53:49,199 --> 01:53:49,990
have that much waiting time i think
um

4292
01:53:49,990 --> 01:53:50,000
um
 

4293
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:51,669
um
as this one

4294
01:53:51,669 --> 01:53:51,679
as this one
 

4295
01:53:51,679 --> 01:53:54,149
as this one
so i could have been done with that

4296
01:53:54,149 --> 01:53:54,159
so i could have been done with that
 

4297
01:53:54,159 --> 01:53:56,149
so i could have been done with that
like six months ago you know that's why

4298
01:53:56,149 --> 01:53:56,159
like six months ago you know that's why
 

4299
01:53:56,159 --> 01:53:58,390
like six months ago you know that's why
it pisses me off so much

4300
01:53:58,390 --> 01:53:58,400
it pisses me off so much
 

4301
01:53:58,400 --> 01:54:00,470
it pisses me off so much
even considering the fact that i i

4302
01:54:00,470 --> 01:54:00,480
even considering the fact that i i
 

4303
01:54:00,480 --> 01:54:02,390
even considering the fact that i i
didn't even need that extra blood test

4304
01:54:02,390 --> 01:54:02,400
didn't even need that extra blood test
 

4305
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:05,189
didn't even need that extra blood test
because i already had one made

4306
01:54:05,189 --> 01:54:05,199
because i already had one made
 

4307
01:54:05,199 --> 01:54:07,030
because i already had one made
before

4308
01:54:07,030 --> 01:54:07,040
before
 

4309
01:54:07,040 --> 01:54:08,550
before
so then if you consider that i could

4310
01:54:08,550 --> 01:54:08,560
so then if you consider that i could
 

4311
01:54:08,560 --> 01:54:11,350
so then if you consider that i could
have been done seven or eight months ago

4312
01:54:11,350 --> 01:54:11,360
have been done seven or eight months ago
 

4313
01:54:11,360 --> 01:54:13,030
have been done seven or eight months ago
because i wouldn't have needed to wait

4314
01:54:13,030 --> 01:54:13,040
because i wouldn't have needed to wait
 

4315
01:54:13,040 --> 01:54:16,870
because i wouldn't have needed to wait
for the extra blood test

4316
01:54:16,870 --> 01:54:16,880
