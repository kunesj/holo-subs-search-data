um
uh walled in

2326
00:53:10,069 --> 00:53:10,079
uh walled in
 

2327
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:14,790
uh walled in
areas with smaller buildings like that

2328
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:14,800
areas with smaller buildings like that
 

2329
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,589
areas with smaller buildings like that
yeah maybe like living quarters

2330
00:53:17,589 --> 00:53:17,599
yeah maybe like living quarters
 

2331
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:19,990

and the gate

2332
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:20,000
and the gate
 

2333
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,390
and the gate
you can't see how small that is probably

2334
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:22,400
you can't see how small that is probably
 

2335
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,230
you can't see how small that is probably
because there's no comparison

2336
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:24,240
because there's no comparison
 

2337
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,349
because there's no comparison
but

2338
00:53:25,349 --> 00:53:25,359
but
 

2339
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:28,630
but
i was standing under that and

2340
00:53:28,630 --> 00:53:28,640
i was standing under that and
 

2341
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:31,829
i was standing under that and
my my head pretty much reached the top

2342
00:53:31,829 --> 00:53:31,839
my my head pretty much reached the top
 

2343
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:33,349
my my head pretty much reached the top

so

2346
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:34,160
so
 

2347
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:37,030

really really tiny were people so small
back then i wonder

2350
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:39,520
back then i wonder
 

2351
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:42,309
back then i wonder
the gate was tiny

2352
00:53:42,309 --> 00:53:42,319
the gate was tiny
 

2353
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:46,549
the gate was tiny
really tiny

3787
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:12,470
there's not supposed to be water there i
think but besides that it's

3788
01:22:12,470 --> 01:22:12,480
think but besides that it's
 

3789
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:15,030
think but besides that it's
i think it looks pretty

3790
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:15,040
i think it looks pretty
 

3791
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:18,790

yeah i couldn't take a good picture
 

3795
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:23,590
yeah i couldn't take a good picture
because

3796
01:22:23,590 --> 01:22:23,600

 

3797
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:26,229

the the night camera from my old phone

3798
01:22:26,229 --> 01:22:26,239
the the night camera from my old phone
 

3799
01:22:26,239 --> 01:22:31,669
the the night camera from my old phone

3805
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,390
wanted me to see it in its normal state
so that's probably why she was a bit

3806
01:22:40,390 --> 01:22:40,400
so that's probably why she was a bit
 

3807
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:41,510
so that's probably why she was a bit
sad

3808
01:22:41,510 --> 01:22:41,520
sad
 

3809
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:43,270

3825
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:55,350
and i was like i guess probably because
of the flooding there's no people there

3826
01:22:55,350 --> 01:22:55,360
of the flooding there's no people there
 

3827
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:57,030

it was not spicy though i was able to

4310
01:32:23,110 --> 01:32:23,120
it was not spicy though i was able to
 

4311
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:25,350
it was not spicy though i was able to
eat it but the more i would get to the

4312
01:32:25,350 --> 01:32:25,360
eat it but the more i would get to the
 

4313
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:26,870
eat it but the more i would get to the
top it's probably because of the seeds

4314
01:32:26,870 --> 01:32:26,880
top it's probably because of the seeds
 

4315
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:28,629
top it's probably because of the seeds
but the more i would get to the top the

4316
01:32:28,629 --> 01:32:28,639
but the more i would get to the top the
 

4317
01:32:28,639 --> 01:32:31,270
but the more i would get to the top the
more spicy it would get but in theory it

4318
01:32:31,270 --> 01:32:31,280
