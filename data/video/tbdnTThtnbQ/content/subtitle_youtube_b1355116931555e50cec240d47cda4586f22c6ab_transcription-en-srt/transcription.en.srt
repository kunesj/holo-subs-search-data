02:39:35,359 --> 02:39:38,870
ah that's difficult um but i think
one day maybe if we are all 3d

4836
02:39:38,870 --> 02:39:38,880
one day maybe if we are all 3d
 

4837
02:39:38,880 --> 02:39:41,349
one day maybe if we are all 3d
we may be we will all sing together if

4838
02:39:41,349 --> 02:39:41,359
we may be we will all sing together if
 

4839
02:39:41,359 --> 02:39:42,950
we may be we will all sing together if
we're like all at the same place but now

4840
02:39:42,950 --> 02:39:42,960
we're like all at the same place but now
 

4841
02:39:42,960 --> 02:39:45,590
we're like all at the same place but now
we're all over the world scattered

4842
02:39:45,590 --> 02:39:45,600
we're all over the world scattered
 

4843
02:39:45,600 --> 02:39:47,349
we're all over the world scattered
and so it's kind of hard to do those

4844
02:39:47,349 --> 02:39:47,359
and so it's kind of hard to do those
 

4845
