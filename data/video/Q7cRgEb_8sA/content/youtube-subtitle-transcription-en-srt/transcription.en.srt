the best way to go about the magazines
 

2283
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,630
the best way to go about the magazines
is probably to like share them in the

2284
01:00:51,630 --> 01:00:51,640
is probably to like share them in the
 

2285
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:53,870
is probably to like share them in the
sense that like oh okay one person does

2286
01:00:53,870 --> 01:00:53,880
sense that like oh okay one person does
 

2287
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:55,230
sense that like oh okay one person does
all the cooking one person does this

2288
01:00:55,230 --> 01:00:55,240
all the cooking one person does this
 

2289
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:56,390
all the cooking one person does this

5933
02:26:28,040 --> 02:26:31,550
trader when we do quests he gives you
like rewards and you can pick water I

5934
02:26:31,550 --> 02:26:31,560
like rewards and you can pick water I
 

5935
02:26:31,560 --> 02:26:34,550
like rewards and you can pick water I
think water every single time yeah there

5936

think water every single time yeah there
 

5937
02:26:34,560 --> 02:26:36,349
think water every single time yeah there
only five shells there's only five all

5938
02:26:36,349 --> 02:26:36,359
only five shells there's only five all
 

5939
02:26:36,359 --> 02:26:39,830
only five shells there's only five all
right is everyone ready yep ready to go

5940
02:26:39,830 --> 02:26:39,840
right is everyone ready yep ready to go
 

5941
02:26:39,840 --> 02:26:41,910
right is everyone ready yep ready to go

we can craft a du collector that's what

5946
02:26:46,670 --> 02:26:46,680
we can craft a du collector that's what
 

5947
02:26:46,680 --> 02:26:50,030
we can craft a du collector that's what
it is we can craft a d colle so yeah if

5948
02:26:50,030 --> 02:26:50,040
it is we can craft a d colle so yeah if
 

5949
02:26:50,040 --> 02:26:53,309
it is we can craft a d colle so yeah if
we do that that would be nice yeah it's

5950
02:26:53,309 --> 02:26:53,319
we do that that would be nice yeah it's
 

5951
02:26:53,319 --> 02:26:55,030
we do that that would be nice yeah it's
we need something called a polymer

5952
02:26:55,030 --> 02:26:55,040
we need something called a polymer
 

5953
02:26:55,040 --> 02:26:57,590
we need something called a polymer
something or another workstation we have

5954
02:26:57,590 --> 02:26:57,600
something or another workstation we have
 

5955
02:26:57,600 --> 02:27:00,710
something or another workstation we have
polymer of those oh yeah workstation uh

5956
02:27:00,710 --> 02:27:00,720
polymer of those oh yeah workstation uh
 

5957
02:27:00,720 --> 02:27:02,510
polymer of those oh yeah workstation uh
so a certain skill will unlock being

5958
02:27:02,510 --> 02:27:02,520
so a certain skill will unlock being
 

5959
02:27:02,520 --> 02:27:05,870
so a certain skill will unlock being
able to make the workstation is robotics

5960
02:27:05,870 --> 02:27:05,880
able to make the workstation is robotics
 

5961
02:27:05,880 --> 02:27:09,349
able to make the workstation is robotics
oh we like a 100 scrap Hol Advanced

5962
02:27:09,349 --> 02:27:09,359
