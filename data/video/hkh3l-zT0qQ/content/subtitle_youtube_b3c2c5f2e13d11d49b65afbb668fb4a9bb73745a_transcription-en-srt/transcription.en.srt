the guide the whole time and then
several steps I had to reverse because I

2800
01:53:57,790 --> 01:53:57,800
several steps I had to reverse because I
 

2801
01:53:57,800 --> 01:53:59,750
several steps I had to reverse because I
thought I was looking really closely at

2802
01:53:59,750 --> 01:53:59,760
thought I was looking really closely at
 

2803
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:02,430
thought I was looking really closely at
the guide but then you realize in the

2804
01:54:02,430 --> 01:54:02,440
the guide but then you realize in the
 

2805
01:54:02,440 --> 01:54:05,669
the guide but then you realize in the
middle that oh something was a little

2806
01:54:05,669 --> 01:54:05,679
middle that oh something was a little
 

2807
01:54:05,679 --> 01:54:08,189
middle that oh something was a little
bit different like one part being the

2808
01:54:08,189 --> 01:54:08,199
bit different like one part being the
 

2809
01:54:08,199 --> 01:54:10,470
bit different like one part being the
wrong way around it still works you can

2810
01:54:10,470 --> 01:54:10,480
wrong way around it still works you can
 

2811
01:54:10,480 --> 01:54:12,669
wrong way around it still works you can
still screw it in but then later on

2812
01:54:12,669 --> 01:54:12,679
still screw it in but then later on
 

2813
01:54:12,679 --> 01:54:14,669
still screw it in but then later on
you'll notice something is a little bit

2814
01:54:14,669 --> 01:54:14,679
you'll notice something is a little bit

the language switching that I do if it
wasn't for that I would probably

11430
07:11:20,788 --> 07:11:20,798
wasn't for that I would probably
 

11431
07:11:20,798 --> 07:11:22,708
wasn't for that I would probably
remember where everything

11432
07:11:22,708 --> 07:11:22,718
remember where everything
 

11433
07:11:22,718 --> 07:11:25,510

phones yeah I mean I wouldn't want
 

11883
07:22:37,878 --> 07:22:41,788
phones yeah I mean I wouldn't want
to keep the world from such useful

11884
07:22:41,788 --> 07:22:41,798
to keep the world from such useful
 

11885
07:22:41,798 --> 07:22:46,750
to keep the world from such useful
Tech um we're betterle off with the

11886
07:22:46,750 --> 07:22:46,760
Tech um we're betterle off with the
 

11887
07:22:46,760 --> 07:22:51,548
Tech um we're betterle off with the
tech but times were better perhaps when

11888
07:22:51,548 --> 07:22:51,558
tech but times were better perhaps when
 

11889
07:22:51,558 --> 07:22:54,190
tech but times were better perhaps when
there was less Tech and it's just

11890
07:22:54,190 --> 07:22:54,200
there was less Tech and it's just
 

11891
07:22:54,200 --> 07:22:55,990
there was less Tech and it's just
getting worse the more we're

11892
07:22:55,990 --> 07:22:56,000
getting worse the more we're
 

11893
07:22:56,000 --> 07:22:58,468
getting worse the more we're
advancing some things are getting better

11894
07:22:58,468 --> 07:22:58,478
advancing some things are getting better
 

11895
07:22:58,478 --> 07:23:00,628
advancing some things are getting better
but now we got to a point where we

11896
07:23:00,628 --> 07:23:00,638
but now we got to a point where we
 

11897
07:23:00,638 --> 07:23:02,670
but now we got to a point where we
Advanced so much that any more

11898
07:23:02,670 --> 07:23:02,680
Advanced so much that any more
 

11899
07:23:02,680 --> 07:23:04,750
Advanced so much that any more
advancement is

11900
07:23:04,750 --> 07:23:04,760
advancement is
 

11901
07:23:04,760 --> 07:23:08,388
advancement is
dangerous giving people more power to do

11902
07:23:08,388 --> 07:23:08,398
dangerous giving people more power to do
 

11903
07:23:08,398 --> 07:23:11,868
dangerous giving people more power to do
evil things more and more in easy ways

11904
07:23:11,868 --> 07:23:11,878
evil things more and more in easy ways
 

11905
07:23:11,878 --> 07:23:14,308
evil things more and more in easy ways
they can even even figure it even figure

11906
07:23:14,308 --> 07:23:14,318
they can even even figure it even figure
 

11907
07:23:14,318 --> 07:23:15,868
they can even even figure it even figure
it out

11908
07:23:15,868 --> 07:23:15,878
it out
 

11909
07:23:15,878 --> 07:23:17,990
it out
themselves that with the tools that have

11910
07:23:17,990 --> 07:23:18,000
themselves that with the tools that have
 

11911
07:23:18,000 --> 07:23:20,548
themselves that with the tools that have
been given to them already at this point

11912
07:23:20,548 --> 07:23:20,558
been given to them already at this point
 

11913
07:23:20,558 --> 07:23:25,468
been given to them already at this point
so it's just uh really bad yeah so

11914
07:23:25,468 --> 07:23:25,478
so it's just uh really bad yeah so
 

11915
07:23:25,478 --> 07:23:27,830
so it's just uh really bad yeah so
robots will take over the world someday

07:23:47,628 --> 07:23:47,638
some some [\h__\h] will go
 

11929
07:23:47,638 --> 07:23:51,430
some some [\h__\h] will go
down maybe already in a 100 years or

11930
07:23:51,430 --> 07:23:51,440
down maybe already in a 100 years or
 

11931
07:23:51,440 --> 07:23:54,110
down maybe already in a 100 years or
less just got getting closer and closer

11932
07:23:54,110 --> 07:23:54,120
less just got getting closer and closer
 

11933
07:23:54,120 --> 07:24:08,868
less just got getting closer and closer
to chaos

11934
07:24:08,868 --> 07:24:08,878

 

11935
07:24:08,878 --> 07:24:12,468

I for one welcome our new robot

a double-edged sword that info travels

11940
07:24:16,788 --> 07:24:16,798
a double-edged sword that info travels
 

11941
07:24:16,798 --> 07:24:18,708
a double-edged sword that info travels
fast so for me I know way more about the

11942
07:24:18,708 --> 07:24:18,718
fast so for me I know way more about the
 

11943
07:24:18,718 --> 07:24:20,468
fast so for me I know way more about the
world than I did before yeah but we know

11944
07:24:20,468 --> 07:24:20,478
world than I did before yeah but we know
 

11945
07:24:20,478 --> 07:24:22,430
world than I did before yeah but we know
too

11946
07:24:22,430 --> 07:24:22,440
too
 

11947
07:24:22,440 --> 07:24:24,788
too
much maybe we know too

11948
07:24:24,788 --> 07:24:24,798
much maybe we know too
 

11949
07:24:24,798 --> 07:24:27,628
much maybe we know too
much there's too many pluses and minuses

11950
07:24:27,628 --> 07:24:27,638
much there's too many pluses and minuses
 

11951
07:24:27,638 --> 07:24:29,548
much there's too many pluses and minuses
to probably know for now the metrics for

11952
07:24:29,548 --> 07:24:29,558
to probably know for now the metrics for
 

11953
07:24:29,558 --> 07:24:31,670
to probably know for now the metrics for
determining

11954
07:24:31,670 --> 07:24:31,680
determining
 

11955
07:24:31,680 --> 07:24:33,628
determining
uh a true positive or negative are still

11956
07:24:33,628 --> 07:24:33,638
uh a true positive or negative are still
 

11957
07:24:33,638 --> 07:24:36,150
uh a true positive or negative are still
not up to date to figure it out well the

11958
07:24:36,150 --> 07:24:36,160
not up to date to figure it out well the
 

11959
07:24:36,160 --> 07:24:38,510
not up to date to figure it out well the
thing is like you can't just tell

11960
07:24:38,510 --> 07:24:38,520
thing is like you can't just tell
 

11961
07:24:38,520 --> 07:24:41,830
thing is like you can't just tell
scientists and tech people and so on to

11962
07:24:41,830 --> 07:24:41,840
scientists and tech people and so on to
 

11963
07:24:41,840 --> 07:24:46,430
scientists and tech people and so on to
just stop trying to evolve things and

11964
07:24:46,430 --> 07:24:46,440
just stop trying to evolve things and
 

11965
07:24:46,440 --> 07:24:48,468
just stop trying to evolve things and
stop trying to figure out new things and

11966
07:24:48,468 --> 07:24:48,478
stop trying to figure out new things and
 

11967
07:24:48,478 --> 07:24:53,430
stop trying to figure out new things and
better things stop trying to make things

11968
07:24:53,430 --> 07:24:53,440
better things stop trying to make things
 

11969
07:24:53,440 --> 07:24:57,110
better things stop trying to make things
better you can't tell them to just stop

11970
07:24:57,110 --> 07:24:57,120
better you can't tell them to just stop
 

11971
07:24:57,120 --> 07:24:58,830
better you can't tell them to just stop
improving and just stop where they are

11972
07:24:58,830 --> 07:24:58,840
improving and just stop where they are
 

11973
07:24:58,840 --> 07:25:01,750
improving and just stop where they are
in time then there's no purpose for them

11974
07:25:01,750 --> 07:25:01,760
in time then there's no purpose for them
 

11975
07:25:01,760 --> 07:25:05,350
in time then there's no purpose for them
and uh yeah it'll also be like what the

12665
07:41:57,840 --> 07:42:01,548
own which I would probably not have if
it was related to school

12666
07:42:01,548 --> 07:42:01,558

 

12667
07:42:01,558 --> 07:42:06,308

07:42:10,628 --> 07:42:10,638
University I can totally see that
 

12671
07:42:10,638 --> 07:42:13,150
University I can totally see that
happening and that's not something to

07:42:13,150 --> 07:42:13,160
happening and that's not something to
 

12673
07:42:13,160 --> 07:42:15,708
happening and that's not something to
feel too bad about because I having a

12674
07:42:15,708 --> 07:42:15,718
feel too bad about because I having a
 

12675
07:42:15,718 --> 07:42:17,868
feel too bad about because I having a
drive for stuff like

12676
07:42:17,868 --> 07:42:17,878
drive for stuff like
 

12677
07:42:17,878 --> 07:42:23,190
drive for stuff like
that is really tough really

12678
07:42:23,190 --> 07:42:23,200

 

12679
07:42:23,200 --> 07:42:26,468

difficult yeah you need so much self-

12680
07:42:26,468 --> 07:42:26,478
difficult yeah you need so much self-
 

12681
07:42:26,478 --> 07:42:29,788
difficult yeah you need so much self-
discipline so much self- discipline but

12682
07:42:29,788 --> 07:42:29,798
discipline so much self- discipline but
 

12683
07:42:29,798 --> 07:42:32,990
discipline so much self- discipline but
yeah at the point of like 10 years if

12684
07:42:32,990 --> 07:42:33,000
