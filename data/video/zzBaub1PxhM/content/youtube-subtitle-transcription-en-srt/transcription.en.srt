867
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,880
through it I guess we get into the D to
get to the ID

868
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:48,890
get to the ID
 

869
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:50,990

is there a reason why it's a ship

902
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:38,880
is there a reason why it's a ship
 

903
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,210
is there a reason why it's a ship
uh because you know

904
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:41,220
uh because you know
 

905
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,149
uh because you know
um uh how do we say Maritime uh we

906
00:25:44,149 --> 00:25:44,159
um uh how do we say Maritime uh we
 

907
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,950
um uh how do we say Maritime uh we
travel to the waters usually so

908
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:47,960
travel to the waters usually so
 

909
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,810
travel to the waters usually so
on the ID server you mean

910
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:50,820
on the ID server you mean
 

911
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:54,110
on the ID server you mean
I'm not like uh traditionally and uh

912
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:54,120
I'm not like uh traditionally and uh
 

913

00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,029
so we decided to make a ship wait so am
I imagining things or didn't uh the ID

918
00:26:02,029 --> 00:26:02,039
I imagining things or didn't uh the ID
 

919
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:04,610
I imagining things or didn't uh the ID
um 3D stage have a ship

920
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:04,620
um 3D stage have a ship
 

921
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:08,090
um 3D stage have a ship
yeah right right exactly okay I thought

922
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:08,100
yeah right right exactly okay I thought
 

923

for your 3D stage that's cool that's
cool I didn't know that yeah I thought

938
00:26:32,029 --> 00:26:32,039
cool I didn't know that yeah I thought

I'd like to hmm but it wouldn't be for a

8338
03:28:50,809 --> 03:28:50,819
I'd like to hmm but it wouldn't be for a
 

8339

while okay because I I want to get an
ally but just like relying on randomly

8342
03:28:56,630 --> 03:28:56,640
ally but just like relying on randomly
 

8343
03:28:56,640 --> 03:28:58,910
ally but just like relying on randomly
finding it somewhere that's like I can't

8344
03:28:58,910 --> 03:28:58,920
finding it somewhere that's like I can't
 

8345
03:28:58,920 --> 03:29:00,349
finding it somewhere that's like I can't
do that like I wouldn't know where to go

8346
03:29:00,349 --> 03:29:00,359
do that like I wouldn't know where to go
 

8347
03:29:00,359 --> 03:29:02,389
do that like I wouldn't know where to go
because I guess they don't spawn

8348
03:29:02,389 --> 03:29:02,399
because I guess they don't spawn
 

8349
03:29:02,399 --> 03:29:03,950
because I guess they don't spawn
randomly after all because you just took

8350
03:29:03,950 --> 03:29:03,960
randomly after all because you just took
 

8351
03:29:03,960 --> 03:29:05,030
randomly after all because you just took
it

8352
03:29:05,030 --> 03:29:05,040
it
 

8353
03:29:05,040 --> 03:29:05,870
it
um

03:29:05,870 --> 03:29:05,880
um
 

8355
03:29:05,880 --> 03:29:07,849
um
I guess so

8356
03:29:07,849 --> 03:29:07,859
I guess so
 

8357
03:29:07,859 --> 03:29:11,570
I guess so

13141
05:24:53,820 --> 05:24:56,150
that's shaped like a flat surface you
can use it to make a car you can have

13142
05:24:56,150 --> 05:24:56,160
can use it to make a car you can have
 

13143
05:24:56,160 --> 05:24:58,190
can use it to make a car you can have
wheels and stuff and I don't know all

13144
05:24:58,190 --> 05:24:58,200
wheels and stuff and I don't know all

14439
05:56:33,540 --> 05:56:36,288
no no it was absolutely ridiculous I it
was no no I just guessed like and I have

14440
05:56:36,288 --> 05:56:36,298
was no no I just guessed like and I have
 

14441
05:56:36,298 --> 05:56:37,910
was no no I just guessed like and I have
no idea and I never claimed I would have

14442
05:56:37,910 --> 05:56:37,920
no idea and I never claimed I would have
 

14443
05:56:37,920 --> 05:56:41,090
no idea and I never claimed I would have
an idea yeah that's how even people in

14444
05:56:41,090 --> 05:56:41,100
an idea yeah that's how even people in
 

14445
05:56:41,100 --> 05:56:43,910
an idea yeah that's how even people in
the US like I think for most people it's

14446
05:56:43,910 --> 05:56:43,920
the US like I think for most people it's
 

14447
05:56:43,920 --> 05:56:45,708
the US like I think for most people it's
like you know the state like where you

14448
05:56:45,708 --> 05:56:45,718
like you know the state like where you
 

14449
05:56:45,718 --> 05:56:47,150
like you know the state like where you
live and then the ones around it maybe

14450
05:56:47,150 --> 05:56:47,160
live and then the ones around it maybe
 

14451
05:56:47,160 --> 05:56:50,150
live and then the ones around it maybe
hmm and for the most part like I don't

14452
05:56:50,150 --> 05:56:50,160
hmm and for the most part like I don't
 

14453
05:56:50,160 --> 05:56:52,128
hmm and for the most part like I don't
know California Florida

14454
05:56:52,128 --> 05:56:52,138
know California Florida
 

14455
05:56:52,138 --> 05:56:54,350
know California Florida
Texas is probably

14456
05:56:54,350 --> 05:56:54,360
Texas is probably
 

14457
05:56:54,360 --> 05:56:57,650
Texas is probably
people will recognize even outside

14458
05:56:57,650 --> 05:56:57,660
people will recognize even outside
 

14459
05:56:57,660 --> 05:57:00,048
people will recognize even outside
of the stage oh yeah Texas the shape is

14460
05:57:00,048 --> 05:57:00,058
of the stage oh yeah Texas the shape is
 

14461
05:57:00,058 --> 05:57:02,570
of the stage oh yeah Texas the shape is
really really easy to recognize the

14462
05:57:02,570 --> 05:57:02,580
really really easy to recognize the
 

14463
05:57:02,580 --> 05:57:06,470
really really easy to recognize the
shape yeah at least yeah that's the only

14464
05:57:06,470 --> 05:57:06,480
shape yeah at least yeah that's the only
 

14465
05:57:06,480 --> 05:57:08,990
shape yeah at least yeah that's the only
reason why I would know where it is not

14466
05:57:08,990 --> 05:57:09,000
reason why I would know where it is not
 

14467
05:57:09,000 --> 05:57:11,750
reason why I would know where it is not
because I know where it's like in the

14468
05:57:11,750 --> 05:57:11,760
because I know where it's like in the
 

14469
05:57:11,760 --> 05:57:14,030
because I know where it's like in the
map no just because I recognize the

14470
05:57:14,030 --> 05:57:14,040
map no just because I recognize the
 

14471
05:57:14,040 --> 05:57:17,330
map no just because I recognize the
shape like I don't think I can

14472
05:57:17,330 --> 05:57:17,340
shape like I don't think I can
 

14473
05:57:17,340 --> 05:57:20,390
shape like I don't think I can
even place all 50 I can I can name all

14474
05:57:20,390 --> 05:57:20,400
even place all 50 I can I can name all
 

14475
05:57:20,400 --> 05:57:23,330
even place all 50 I can I can name all
50 but I'd probably struggle will you

14476
05:57:23,330 --> 05:57:23,340
50 but I'd probably struggle will you
 

14477
05:57:23,340 --> 05:57:26,270
50 but I'd probably struggle will you
