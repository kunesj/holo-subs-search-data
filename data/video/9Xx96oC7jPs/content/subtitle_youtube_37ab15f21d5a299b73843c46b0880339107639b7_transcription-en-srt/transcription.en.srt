5127
02:33:19,859 --> 02:33:23,330

bit of Korean in my line but that's

5128
02:33:23,330 --> 02:33:23,340
bit of Korean in my line but that's
 

5129
02:33:23,340 --> 02:33:25,010
bit of Korean in my line but that's
that's because you know that was what

5130
02:33:25,010 --> 02:33:25,020
that's because you know that was what
 

5131
02:33:25,020 --> 02:33:26,570
that's because you know that was what
was in the script and I'm assuming it's

5132
02:33:26,570 --> 02:33:26,580
was in the script and I'm assuming it's
 

5133
02:33:26,580 --> 02:33:28,490
was in the script and I'm assuming it's
because I think counterside is like

5134
02:33:28,490 --> 02:33:28,500
because I think counterside is like
 

5135
02:33:28,500 --> 02:33:30,490
because I think counterside is like
originally from

add carrots I felt like I was making

6708
03:24:20,710 --> 03:24:20,720
add carrots I felt like I was making
 

6709
03:24:20,720 --> 03:24:23,809
add carrots I felt like I was making
pasta but the recipe demanded carrots

6710
03:24:23,809 --> 03:24:23,819
pasta but the recipe demanded carrots
 

6711
03:24:23,819 --> 03:24:25,849

carrots when I was eating the burger but
 

6715
03:24:27,899 --> 03:24:30,229
carrots when I was eating the burger but
I'm just guessing it added a a good

6716
03:24:30,229 --> 03:24:30,239
I'm just guessing it added a a good
 

6717
03:24:30,239 --> 03:24:32,229
I'm just guessing it added a a good
special flavor

6718
03:24:32,229 --> 03:24:32,239
special flavor
 

6719
03:24:32,239 --> 03:24:37,190

7480
03:42:32,929 --> 03:42:32,939
but yeah once he reeled it in he would
 

7481
03:42:32,939 --> 03:42:35,090
