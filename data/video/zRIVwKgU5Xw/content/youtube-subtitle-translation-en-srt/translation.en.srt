2090
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:40,730

the sea.  It's close to O, but it's 2000m from there. I wonder

2091
00:57:40,730 --> 00:57:40,740
the sea.  It's close to O, but it's 2000m from there. I wonder
 

2092
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:43,250
the sea.  It's close to O, but it's 2000m from there. I wonder
if this is

2093
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:43,260
if this is
 

2094
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:44,770
if this is
possible. Leave it to me. 65 I'll see if I can

2095
00:57:44,770 --> 00:57:44,780
possible. Leave it to me. 65 I'll see if I can
 

2096
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:47,329
possible. Leave it to me. 65 I'll see if I can
kill it.

2097
00:57:47,329 --> 00:57:47,339
kill it.
 

2098
00:57:47,339 --> 00:57:50,510
kill it.
65 It's quite far, but half of it.  It

2099
00:57:50,510 --> 00:57:50,520
65 It's quite far, but half of it.  It
 

2100
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:52,849
65 It's quite far, but half of it.  It
might be a force, oh yeah,

what do you mean by refuting it? It

2105
00:57:57,829 --> 00:57:57,839
what do you mean by refuting it? It
 

2106
00:57:57,839 --> 00:58:06,309
what do you mean by refuting it? It
doesn't mean anything. It's like driving a car,

2107
00:58:06,309 --> 00:58:06,319

 

2108
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:10,549
