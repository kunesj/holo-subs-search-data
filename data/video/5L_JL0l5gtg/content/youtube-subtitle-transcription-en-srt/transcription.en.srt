they got a little like a little sparkly

1148
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:02,880
they got a little like a little sparkly
 

1149
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,070
they got a little like a little sparkly
diamond on top of it or

1150
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:05,080
diamond on top of it or
 

1151
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:08,230
diamond on top of it or
so but yeah reasons why I chose this is

1152
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:08,240
so but yeah reasons why I chose this is
 

1153
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,190
so but yeah reasons why I chose this is
first of all the vision worked well for

1154
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:10,200
first of all the vision worked well for
 

1155
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:14,029
first of all the vision worked well for
me and um also because of physics let me

1156
00:31:14,029 --> 00:31:14,039
me and um also because of physics let me
 

1157
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:16,269
me and um also because of physics let me
tell you I think the Fred modeler was

1158
00:31:16,269 --> 00:31:16,279
tell you I think the Fred modeler was
 

1159
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:17,990
tell you I think the Fred modeler was
very grateful for

1160
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:18,000
very grateful for
 

1161
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,629
very grateful for
that because uh the other outfits that

1162
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:20,639
that because uh the other outfits that
 

1163
00:31:20,639 --> 00:31:22,470
that because uh the other outfits that
were suggested were very they had a lot

1164
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:22,480
were suggested were very they had a lot
 

1165
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,549
were suggested were very they had a lot
of very flowy elements in them and then

1166
00:31:25,549 --> 00:31:25,559
of very flowy elements in them and then
 

1167
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:27,310
of very flowy elements in them and then
we would have had issues probably with

1168
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:27,320
we would have had issues probably with
 

1169
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,509
we would have had issues probably with
physics and collision and this is all

1170
00:31:29,509 --> 00:31:29,519
physics and collision and this is all
 

1171
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:33,190
physics and collision and this is all
skin tight so it's easier to model that

1172
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:33,200
skin tight so it's easier to model that
 

1173
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,710
skin tight so it's easier to model that
and yeah easier and

1174
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:36,720
and yeah easier and
 

1175
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,149
and yeah easier and
faster so this turned into the

1176
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:40,159
faster so this turned into the
 

1177
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:43,509
faster so this turned into the
3D yeah yeah 3D model is written in the

1178
00:31:43,509 --> 00:31:43,519
3D yeah yeah 3D model is written in the
 

1179
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:46,830
3D yeah yeah 3D model is written in the
credits in the uh music video check it

1180
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:46,840
credits in the uh music video check it
 

1181
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,909
credits in the uh music video check it
out um but yeah this also was a bit

1182
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:49,919
out um but yeah this also was a bit
 

1183
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,509

difficult because

1184
00:31:52,509 --> 00:31:52,519
difficult because
 

1185
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:55,909
difficult because
um somewhere in this like reference

00:31:55,909 --> 00:31:55,919
um somewhere in this like reference
 

1187
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,149
um somewhere in this like reference
sheet uh they wrote or or mon told me

1188
00:31:59,149 --> 00:31:59,159
sheet uh they wrote or or mon told me
 

1189
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:01,070
sheet uh they wrote or or mon told me
separately I'm not sure they told me

1190
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:01,080
separately I'm not sure they told me
 

1191
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,750
separately I'm not sure they told me
that what kind of like fabric effect

00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:04,760
that what kind of like fabric effect
 

1193
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,909
that what kind of like fabric effect
they would

1194
00:32:06,909 --> 00:32:06,919
they would
 

1195
00:32:06,919 --> 00:32:10,350
they would
see fitting for this what word did they

1196
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:10,360
see fitting for this what word did they
 

1197

um the thing is we tried to make that

1200
00:32:17,549 --> 00:32:17,559
um the thing is we tried to make that
 

1201
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:19,509
um the thing is we tried to make that
work and

1202
00:32:19,509 --> 00:32:19,519
work and
 

1203
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:25,110
work and
I uh i n no no no it ended up being

1204
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:25,120
I uh i n no no no it ended up being
 

1205
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:29,070

shiny lever uh for black but but then
 

1207
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:34,549

1221
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:01,269
before holographic not Qui but
yeah wait there was this one picture

1222
00:33:01,269 --> 00:33:01,279

 

1223
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:04,470

there it

1225
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,830

is I guess maybe that is holographic

1229
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:16,750

up but where did it go

1230
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:16,760

 

1231
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:20,110

now so something like this but it just

1232
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:20,120
now so something like this but it just
 

1233
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,830
now so something like this but it just
didn't work out it just didn't work out

1234
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:22,840
didn't work out it just didn't work out
 

1235
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,909
didn't work out it just didn't work out
but that also took a lot of time and

1236
00:33:24,909 --> 00:33:24,919
but that also took a lot of time and
 

1237
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:27,190
but that also took a lot of time and
then in the end I was just like whatever

1238
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:27,200
then in the end I was just like whatever
 

1239
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,669
then in the end I was just like whatever
let's just make get white uh without

1240
00:33:29,669 --> 00:33:29,679
let's just make get white uh without
 

1241
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:30,909
let's just make get white uh without
this

00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:30,919
this
 

1243
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:34,190
this
effect and so yeah I was so stressed out

1244
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:34,200
effect and so yeah I was so stressed out
 

1245
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,990
effect and so yeah I was so stressed out
about this the model literally got more

1246
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:37,000
about this the model literally got more
 

1247
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,080
about this the model literally got more

with a different 3D modeler and I will

1264
00:34:07,269 --> 00:34:07,279
with a different 3D modeler and I will
 

1265
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,710
with a different 3D modeler and I will
say seon I think you could have done it

1266
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:09,720
say seon I think you could have done it
 

1267
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:12,069
say seon I think you could have done it
too

1268
00:34:12,069 --> 00:34:12,079
too
 

1269
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,510
too
like but then seon was like I don't

1270
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:14,520
like but then seon was like I don't
 

1271
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,510
like but then seon was like I don't
think I can do it and I'm like I think

1272
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:16,520
think I can do it and I'm like I think
 

1273
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,990
think I can do it and I'm like I think
you can but okay then I got to look for

1274
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:19,000
you can but okay then I got to look for
 

1275
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,550
you can but okay then I got to look for
someone else and that's just like

1276
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:21,560
someone else and that's just like
 

1277
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:25,750

everything was um scary for me I I

00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,869
everything was um scary for me I I
didn't I didn't want this music video to

1280
00:34:27,869 --> 00:34:27,879
didn't I didn't want this music video to
 

1281
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:31,030
didn't I didn't want this music video to
come out later than it should so I was a

1282
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:31,040
come out later than it should so I was a
 

1283
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,829
come out later than it should so I was a
bit

1284
00:34:32,829 --> 00:34:32,839
bit
 

1285
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:35,589

terrified kind of I was so worried too I

you think we're fine do you think we're

1290
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:38,280
you think we're fine do you think we're

1293
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:46,030

fine but the one thing that was really

1294
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:46,040
fine but the one thing that was really
 

1295
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,069
fine but the one thing that was really
good this time is that

1296

00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:17,240
motion because I can record the motion
 

1313
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,589
motion because I can record the motion
at home with my accents but I would be

1314
00:35:19,589 --> 00:35:19,599
at home with my accents but I would be
 

1315
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,630
at home with my accents but I would be
alone I would not be really able to

1316
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:22,640
alone I would not be really able to
 

1317
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,990
alone I would not be really able to
record my back dancers's

1318
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:25,000
record my back dancers's
 

1319
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,349
record my back dancers's
motion um

1320
00:35:28,349 --> 00:35:28,359
motion um
 

1321
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:31,190
motion um
and that would be sad so it would be

1322
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:31,200
and that would be sad so it would be
 

1323
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,150
and that would be sad so it would be
perfect if I could have the motion

1324
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:33,160
perfect if I could have the motion
 

1325
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,589
perfect if I could have the motion
capture from the data from the studio

1326
00:35:36,589 --> 00:35:36,599
capture from the data from the studio
 

1327
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:38,990
capture from the data from the studio
and then put it into the music video

1328
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:39,000
and then put it into the music video
 

1329
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,630
and then put it into the music video
because the freedy live needed you know

1330
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:42,640
because the freedy live needed you know
 

1331
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,630
because the freedy live needed you know
like all kinds of like editing and so on

1332
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:44,640
like all kinds of like editing and so on
 

1333
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,150
like all kinds of like editing and so on
so there was some buffer time between

1334
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:48,160
so there was some buffer time between
 

1335
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,710
so there was some buffer time between
the recording of it and then the release

1336
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:50,720
the recording of it and then the release
 

1337
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,550
the recording of it and then the release
of

1338
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:51,560
of
 

1339
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:55,790
of
it and so with been like after the

1340
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:55,800
it and so with been like after the
 

1341
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,950
it and so with been like after the
recording we got the motion data and we

1342
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:57,960
recording we got the motion data and we
 

1343
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,950
recording we got the motion data and we
sent it to kanu and he was like able to

1344
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:00,960
sent it to kanu and he was like able to
 

1345
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,470
sent it to kanu and he was like able to
already look into it and

1346
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:03,480
already look into it and
 

1347
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,510
already look into it and
then while kanu was working on the music

1348
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:06,520
then while kanu was working on the music
 

1349
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,190
then while kanu was working on the music
video The Studio was finishing up the 3D

1350
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:09,200
video The Studio was finishing up the 3D
 

1351
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,670
video The Studio was finishing up the 3D
life and then we timed it to be at the

1352
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:11,680
life and then we timed it to be at the
 

1353
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,910
life and then we timed it to be at the
same time yeah

1354
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:13,920
same time yeah
 

1355
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,710
same time yeah
so yeah it's from the same

1356
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:17,720
so yeah it's from the same
 

1357
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:22,270
so yeah it's from the same
recording yeah and this way like uh see

1358
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:22,280
recording yeah and this way like uh see
 

1359
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,470
recording yeah and this way like uh see
let's even put aside the back dancers

1360
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:24,480
let's even put aside the back dancers
 

1361
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,190
let's even put aside the back dancers
that came with this if I would have done

1362
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:27,200
that came with this if I would have done
 

1363
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,550
that came with this if I would have done
it alone I would have done it with my

1364
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:28,560
it alone I would have done it with my
 

1365
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,349
it alone I would have done it with my
accents here uh at home and we did that

1366
00:36:31,349 --> 00:36:31,359
accents here uh at home and we did that
 

1367
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,750
accents here uh at home and we did that
with Chimera but the

1368
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:33,760
with Chimera but the
 

1369
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:38,349
with Chimera but the
data was just so messy and kanuru had to

1370
00:36:38,349 --> 00:36:38,359
data was just so messy and kanuru had to
 

1371
00:36:38,359 --> 00:36:42,270
data was just so messy and kanuru had to
like fix a lot of like jankiness and I

1372
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:42,280
like fix a lot of like jankiness and I
 

1373
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,550
like fix a lot of like jankiness and I
think chy also has experience with

1374
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:45,560
think chy also has experience with
 

1375
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,510
think chy also has experience with
fixing my motion data that I take at

1376
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:48,520
fixing my motion data that I take at
 

1377
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,750
fixing my motion data that I take at
home with my exent suit is for some

1378
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:51,760
home with my exent suit is for some
 

1379
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,349
home with my exent suit is for some
reason it's just so janky and

1380
00:36:56,349 --> 00:36:56,359
reason it's just so janky and
 

1381
00:36:56,359 --> 00:36:59,550
reason it's just so janky and
wobbly uh it's just so annoying and

1382
00:36:59,550 --> 00:36:59,560
wobbly uh it's just so annoying and
 

1383
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,109
wobbly uh it's just so annoying and
fixing that takes a lot of time

1384
00:37:02,109 --> 00:37:02,119
fixing that takes a lot of time
 

1385
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:03,750
fixing that takes a lot of time
too

1386
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:03,760
too
 

1387
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,309
too
um

1388
00:37:05,309 --> 00:37:05,319
um
 

1389
00:37:05,319 --> 00:37:10,470
um
so I was just hoping to be able to use

1390
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:10,480
so I was just hoping to be able to use
 

1391
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,589
so I was just hoping to be able to use
the studio data and thankfully we were

1392
00:37:13,589 --> 00:37:13,599
the studio data and thankfully we were
 

1393
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,910
the studio data and thankfully we were
able to do that yeah it was it was kind

1394
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:16,920
able to do that yeah it was it was kind
 

1395
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,390
able to do that yeah it was it was kind
of funny though there was like this

1396
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:18,400
of funny though there was like this
 

1397
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,030
of funny though there was like this
misunderstanding we had I uh they were

1398
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:21,040
misunderstanding we had I uh they were
 

1399
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,589
misunderstanding we had I uh they were
like yeah yeah sure we can give you the

1400
00:37:22,589 --> 00:37:22,599
like yeah yeah sure we can give you the
 

1401
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:27,030
like yeah yeah sure we can give you the
motion capture data okay um but it will

1402
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:27,040
motion capture data okay um but it will
 

1403
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,589
motion capture data okay um but it will
take from the recording day uh till you

1404
00:37:30,589 --> 00:37:30,599
take from the recording day uh till you
 

1405
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:34,109
take from the recording day uh till you
receive it it will probably take a month

1406
00:37:34,109 --> 00:37:34,119
receive it it will probably take a month
 

1407
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:35,030
receive it it will probably take a month
and I'm

1408
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:35,040
and I'm
 

1409
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,750
and I'm
like what

1410
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:37,760
like what
 

1411
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,349
like what
why

1412
00:37:39,349 --> 00:37:39,359
why
 

1413
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,530
why
why that'll be too

1414
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:41,540
why that'll be too
 

1415
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,990
why that'll be too
[Music]

1416

late and then I kept on like um trying

1418
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:46,880
late and then I kept on like um trying
 

1419
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,349
late and then I kept on like um trying
to like dig deeper and be like why why

1420
00:37:49,349 --> 00:37:49,359
to like dig deeper and be like why why
 

1421
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:51,190
to like dig deeper and be like why why
can we not maybe just have the kiata

1422
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:51,200
can we not maybe just have the kiata
 

1423
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,270
can we not maybe just have the kiata
motion first I don't know what what the

1424
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:53,280
motion first I don't know what what the
 

1425
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,950
motion first I don't know what what the
problem is and then eventually

1426
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:55,960
problem is and then eventually
 

1427
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,470
problem is and then eventually
misunderstanding was cleared up the one

1428
00:37:59,470 --> 00:37:59,480
misunderstanding was cleared up the one
 

1429
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,910
misunderstanding was cleared up the one
month would have been if and they

1430
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:02,920
month would have been if and they
 

1431
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,190
month would have been if and they
assumed that they that I was asking them

1432
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:05,200
assumed that they that I was asking them
 

1433
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,870
assumed that they that I was asking them
to do that if they would have had to fix

1434
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:07,880
to do that if they would have had to fix
 

1435
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:11,910
to do that if they would have had to fix
and like like you know like just edit

1436
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:11,920
and like like you know like just edit
 

1437
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,069
and like like you know like just edit
and work on the motion capture data in

1438
00:38:14,069 --> 00:38:14,079
and work on the motion capture data in
 

1439
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:15,470
and work on the motion capture data in
case there's any jankiness and

1440
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:15,480
case there's any jankiness and
 

1441
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,470
case there's any jankiness and
wobbliness and glitchiness and whatever

1442
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:18,480
wobbliness and glitchiness and whatever
 

1443
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,950
wobbliness and glitchiness and whatever
uh but all I wanted was the raw motion

1444
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:20,960
uh but all I wanted was the raw motion
 

1445
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,030
uh but all I wanted was the raw motion
capture data and that they were able to

1446
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:23,040
capture data and that they were able to
 

1447
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,470
capture data and that they were able to
give me like pretty much right away and

1448
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:25,480
give me like pretty much right away and
 

1449
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,910
give me like pretty much right away and
I was like yeah that's that's really all

1450
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:26,920
I was like yeah that's that's really all
 

1451
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,670
I was like yeah that's that's really all
I needed thank

1452
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:29,680
I needed thank
 

1453
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,990
I needed thank
you but first I was just kind of

1454
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:32,000
you but first I was just kind of
 

1455
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,670
you but first I was just kind of
panicking because uh that

1456
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:33,680
panicking because uh that
 

1457
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,470
panicking because uh that
misunderstanding wasn't wasn't cleared

1458
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:35,480
misunderstanding wasn't wasn't cleared
 

1459
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,349
misunderstanding wasn't wasn't cleared
up for a while and so I discussed with

1460
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:38,359
up for a while and so I discussed with
 

1461
00:38:38,359 --> 00:38:40,349
up for a while and so I discussed with
Kan of how are we going to do this can

1462
00:38:40,349 --> 00:38:40,359
Kan of how are we going to do this can
 

1463
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:43,349
Kan of how are we going to do this can
we put a placeholder Motion in there and

1464
00:38:43,349 --> 00:38:43,359
we put a placeholder Motion in there and
 

1465
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:45,990
we put a placeholder Motion in there and
then replace it like one day before the

1466
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:46,000
then replace it like one day before the
 

1467
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,750
then replace it like one day before the
music video releases

1468
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:49,760

 

1469
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,750

maybe yeah so that was another thing I

1470
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:53,760
maybe yeah so that was another thing I
 

1471
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,470
maybe yeah so that was another thing I

green screened into it more or less and
I was planning that and it was

1998
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:33,720
I was planning that and it was
 

1999
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:35,950
I was planning that and it was
originally in this plan and it was also

2000
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:35,960
originally in this plan and it was also
 

2001
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:38,510
originally in this plan and it was also
going to take up a lot of time of the

2002
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:38,520
going to take up a lot of time of the
 

2003
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,829
going to take up a lot of time of the
recording schedule because setting up

2004
00:51:40,829 --> 00:51:40,839
recording schedule because setting up
 

2005
00:51:40,839 --> 00:51:42,990
recording schedule because setting up
everything would take so much time and

2006
00:51:42,990 --> 00:51:43,000
everything would take so much time and
 

2007
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,510
everything would take so much time and
then I would have been able to do less

2008
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:44,520
then I would have been able to do less
 

2009
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,630
then I would have been able to do less
songs so in the in the end maybe it's

pronunciation certain words will not fit

2286
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:22,680
pronunciation certain words will not fit
 

2287
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:23,829

the Rhythm

2288
00:58:23,829 --> 00:58:23,839
the Rhythm
 

2289
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:26,549
the Rhythm
anymore and so I was struggling a lot

2290
00:58:26,549 --> 00:58:26,559
anymore and so I was struggling a lot
 

2291
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:30,309
anymore and so I was struggling a lot
with that and I was trying to fix those

2292
00:58:30,309 --> 00:58:30,319
with that and I was trying to fix those
 

2293
00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:32,390
with that and I was trying to fix those
things without changing the lyrics

2294
00:58:32,390 --> 00:58:32,400
things without changing the lyrics
 

2295
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:35,470
things without changing the lyrics
because I wasn't allowed to change the

2296
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:35,480
because I wasn't allowed to change the
 

2297
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:37,950
because I wasn't allowed to change the
lyrics uh and I wasn't allowed to change

2298
00:58:37,950 --> 00:58:37,960
lyrics uh and I wasn't allowed to change
 

2299
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:40,510
lyrics uh and I wasn't allowed to change
the Melodies I was like given a little

2300
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:40,520
the Melodies I was like given a little
 

2301
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:44,829
the Melodies I was like given a little
bit of a leeway to adjust the rhythm of

2302
00:58:44,829 --> 00:58:44,839
bit of a leeway to adjust the rhythm of
 

2303
00:58:44,839 --> 00:58:46,910
bit of a leeway to adjust the rhythm of
the words because otherwise it just

2304
00:58:46,910 --> 00:58:46,920
the words because otherwise it just
 

2305
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:48,430
the words because otherwise it just
wouldn't work and I'm not going to

2306
00:58:48,430 --> 00:58:48,440
wouldn't work and I'm not going to
 

2307
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:51,150
wouldn't work and I'm not going to
purposefully sing it with a wrong

2308
00:58:51,150 --> 00:58:51,160
purposefully sing it with a wrong
 

2309
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:53,029
purposefully sing it with a wrong
pronunciation because then what's the

2310
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:53,039
pronunciation because then what's the
 

2311
00:58:53,039 --> 00:58:54,789
pronunciation because then what's the
point of me singing it as a German

2312
00:58:54,789 --> 00:58:54,799

and then they were perfectly free long

2418
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:21,520

 

2419
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:23,109

[\h__\h]

2420
01:01:23,109 --> 01:01:23,119
[\h__\h]
 

2421
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:26,190
[\h__\h]
lines where I thought this should be a

2422
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:26,200
lines where I thought this should be a
 

2423
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:28,589
lines where I thought this should be a
solo first of all because it's going to

2424
01:01:28,589 --> 01:01:28,599
solo first of all because it's going to
 

2425
01:01:28,599 --> 01:01:30,390
solo first of all because it's going to
difficult going to be maybe difficult to

2426
01:01:30,390 --> 01:01:30,400
difficult going to be maybe difficult to
 

2427
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,870
difficult going to be maybe difficult to
time it well when we're all seeing it at

2428
01:01:32,870 --> 01:01:32,880
time it well when we're all seeing it at
 

2429
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,630
time it well when we're all seeing it at
the same time but also it's going to

2430
01:01:34,630 --> 01:01:34,640
the same time but also it's going to
 

2431
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:38,910
the same time but also it's going to
really show off the vocal prowess of

2432
01:01:38,910 --> 01:01:38,920
really show off the vocal prowess of
 

2433
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:43,349
really show off the vocal prowess of

uh you know there's like two different
 

3519
01:29:57,800 --> 01:30:01,709
uh you know there's like two different
types there's like somewhat normal

3520
01:30:01,709 --> 01:30:01,719
types there's like somewhat normal
 

3521
01:30:01,719 --> 01:30:05,189
types there's like somewhat normal
shoes um and then there's like kind of

3522
01:30:05,189 --> 01:30:05,199
shoes um and then there's like kind of
 

3523
01:30:05,199 --> 01:30:06,310
shoes um and then there's like kind of
dancer

3524
01:30:06,310 --> 01:30:06,320
dancer
 

3525
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:09,550
dancer
shoes where the soul is the soul is

3526
01:30:09,550 --> 01:30:09,560
shoes where the soul is the soul is
 

3527
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:11,229
shoes where the soul is the soul is
mostly different and the dancer shoes

3528
01:30:11,229 --> 01:30:11,239
mostly different and the dancer shoes
 

3529
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:12,510
mostly different and the dancer shoes
are kind

3530
01:30:12,510 --> 01:30:12,520
are kind
 

3531
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:15,310
are kind
of they they feel more loose but also

3532
01:30:15,310 --> 01:30:15,320
of they they feel more loose but also
 

3533
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:17,390
of they they feel more loose but also
more tight it's kind of weird to explain

3534
01:30:17,390 --> 01:30:17,400
more tight it's kind of weird to explain
 

3535
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:20,270
more tight it's kind of weird to explain
but they're just made differently and

3536
01:30:20,270 --> 01:30:20,280
but they're just made differently and
 

3537
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:22,310
but they're just made differently and
this whole time because the dancer shoes

3538
01:30:22,310 --> 01:30:22,320
this whole time because the dancer shoes
 

3539
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:24,830
this whole time because the dancer shoes
are so hard to get into

3540

so basically I just like looked at at
 

3951
01:46:54,719 --> 01:46:56,910
so basically I just like looked at at
that time I think it was maybe still

3952
01:46:56,910 --> 01:46:56,920
that time I think it was maybe still
 

3953
01:46:56,920 --> 01:46:59,870
that time I think it was maybe still
relatively newly released maybe was it

3954
01:46:59,870 --> 01:46:59,880
relatively newly released maybe was it
 

3955
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:03,510
relatively newly released maybe was it
uh but I saw Ana's class and I was like

Parts when we were practicing so I
 

4051
01:49:31,719 --> 01:49:34,149
Parts when we were practicing so I
wouldn't really like first they would

4052
01:49:34,149 --> 01:49:34,159
wouldn't really like first they would
 

4053
01:49:34,159 --> 01:49:35,550
wouldn't really like first they would
teach me the move and then we would turn

4054
01:49:35,550 --> 01:49:35,560
teach me the move and then we would turn
 

4055
01:49:35,560 --> 01:49:38,470
teach me the move and then we would turn
on the music and attach it to the music

4056
01:49:38,470 --> 01:49:38,480
on the music and attach it to the music
 

4057
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:40,589
on the music and attach it to the music
but it's it was just so difficult

4058
01:49:40,589 --> 01:49:40,599
but it's it was just so difficult
 

4059
01:49:40,599 --> 01:49:43,390
but it's it was just so difficult
because they were dancing the back

4060
01:49:43,390 --> 01:49:43,400
because they were dancing the back
 

4061
01:49:43,400 --> 01:49:45,750
because they were dancing the back
dancer moves and then I would forget

4062
01:49:45,750 --> 01:49:45,760
dancer moves and then I would forget
 

4063
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:47,709
dancer moves and then I would forget
what was I supposed to do and I wouldn't

4064
01:49:47,709 --> 01:49:47,719
what was I supposed to do and I wouldn't
 

4065
01:49:47,719 --> 01:49:49,149
what was I supposed to do and I wouldn't
have a reference to it do you know what

4076
01:49:59,229 --> 01:49:59,239
I could reference that but then we were
 

4077
01:49:59,239 --> 01:50:01,669
I could reference that but then we were
missing the back dancer that they were

I do like everything then there's this
 

8491
03:48:21,279 --> 03:48:23,670
I do like everything then there's this
expectation then that that will always

8492
03:48:23,670 --> 03:48:23,680
expectation then that that will always
 

8493
03:48:23,680 --> 03:48:25,830
expectation then that that will always
happen for every single tweet you write

8494

happen for every single tweet you write
 

8495
03:48:25,840 --> 03:48:28,309
happen for every single tweet you write
and then that will really take up a lot

8496
03:48:28,309 --> 03:48:28,319
and then that will really take up a lot
 

8497
03:48:28,319 --> 03:48:31,229
and then that will really take up a lot
of time if I have if if I'm being

8498
03:48:31,229 --> 03:48:31,239
of time if I have if if I'm being
 

8499
03:48:31,239 --> 03:48:33,870
of time if I have if if I'm being
expected to do that constantly for 4

8500
03:48:33,870 --> 03:48:33,880

8501
03:48:33,880 --> 03:48:36,189
expected to do that constantly for 4
years to like every single tweet that

8502
03:48:36,189 --> 03:48:36,199

03:51:12,000 --> 03:51:13,429
too but it doesn't look like it so far
and there's no point in me playing alone

8612
03:51:13,429 --> 03:51:13,439
and there's no point in me playing alone
 

8613
03:51:13,439 --> 03:51:15,429
and there's no point in me playing alone
because I literally can't play alone I

8614
03:51:15,429 --> 03:51:15,439
because I literally can't play alone I
 

8615

03:52:45,070 --> 03:52:45,080
it kind of messes things up so I kind of
 

8675
03:52:45,080 --> 03:52:47,950
it kind of messes things up so I kind of

8687
03:52:59,199 --> 03:53:03,030
bit but I'm probably going to do
a uh a personal like deadline like I'm

8688
03:53:03,030 --> 03:53:03,040
a uh a personal like deadline like I'm

[\h__\h]
 

8693
03:53:06,720 --> 03:53:09,950
[\h__\h]
that cuz if even if I'm awake until like

8694
03:53:09,950 --> 03:53:09,960
that cuz if even if I'm awake until like
 

8695
03:53:09,960 --> 03:53:12,950
that cuz if even if I'm awake until like
600 7 800 a.m. these days for whatever

8696
03:53:12,950 --> 03:53:12,960
600 7 800 a.m. these days for whatever
 

8697
03:53:12,960 --> 03:53:16,229
600 7 800 a.m. these days for whatever
reason uh if I stream until that time

8698
03:53:16,229 --> 03:53:16,239
reason uh if I stream until that time
 

8699
03:53:16,239 --> 03:53:18,149
reason uh if I stream until that time
that means I'm staying up even longer

8700
03:53:18,149 --> 03:53:18,159
that means I'm staying up even longer
 

8701
03:53:18,159 --> 03:53:19,950
that means I'm staying up even longer
because I can't just immediately fall

8702
03:53:19,950 --> 03:53:19,960
because I can't just immediately fall
 

8703
03:53:19,960 --> 03:53:22,349
because I can't just immediately fall
asleep the moment I end my

8704
03:53:22,349 --> 03:53:22,359
asleep the moment I end my
 

8705
03:53:22,359 --> 03:53:24,790
asleep the moment I end my
stream I usually need like some time to

8706
03:53:24,790 --> 03:53:24,800
stream I usually need like some time to
 

8707
03:53:24,800 --> 03:53:25,990
stream I usually need like some time to
eat

8708
03:53:25,990 --> 03:53:26,000
eat
 

8709
03:53:26,000 --> 03:53:28,750
eat
dinner and then some time to wind down

8710
03:53:28,750 --> 03:53:28,760
dinner and then some time to wind down
 

8711
03:53:28,760 --> 03:53:30,630
dinner and then some time to wind down
so that adds like I don't know another

8712
03:53:30,630 --> 03:53:30,640
so that adds like I don't know another
 

8713
03:53:30,640 --> 03:53:32,229
so that adds like I don't know another
two hours or

8717
03:53:37,520 --> 03:53:40,710
so usually sometimes even 3 hours so
