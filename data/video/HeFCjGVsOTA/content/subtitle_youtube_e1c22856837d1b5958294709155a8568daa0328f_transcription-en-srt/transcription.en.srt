1139
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:08,110

guess I suppose so the more the

1140
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:08,120

 

1141
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,669

become more
powerful okay when all talents of a

1148
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:17,159

certain instrument leave the field the

1150
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:19,120
certain instrument leave the field the
 

1151
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,029
certain instrument leave the field the
effect of that instrument will disappear

1152
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:21,039
effect of that instrument will disappear
 

1153
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:23,070
effect of that instrument will disappear
and the overall level will

1154
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:23,080
and the overall level will
 

1155
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:27,830
and the overall level will
decrease let's say I have four no sagis

1156
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:27,840
decrease let's say I have four no sagis
 

1157
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,430
decrease let's say I have four no sagis
so it's at level four but one dies so it

1158
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:31,440
so it's at level four but one dies so it
 

1159
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,509
so it's at level four but one dies so it
goes back to level

1160
00:30:33,509 --> 00:30:33,519
goes back to level
 

1161
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:35,990
