00:24:18,029 --> 00:24:18,039
advice I think you can put it in the
 

995
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:20,230
advice I think you can put it in the
freezer is that a serious um no I looked

996
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:20,240
freezer is that a serious um no I looked
 

997
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,870
freezer is that a serious um no I looked
that up too and people were saying

998
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:21,880
that up too and people were saying
 

999
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,230
that up too and people were saying
there's nothing to prove that that

1000
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:23,240
there's nothing to prove that that
 

1001
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,830
there's nothing to prove that that
actually works but that would maybe

1002
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:25,840
actually works but that would maybe
 

1003
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,909
actually works but that would maybe
imply that it got overheated or so but I

1004
00:24:27,909 --> 00:24:27,919
imply that it got overheated or so but I
 

1005
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:29,310
imply that it got overheated or so but I
think it overheated at all it didn't

1006
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:29,320
think it overheated at all it didn't
 

1007
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,269
think it overheated at all it didn't
feel hot when it done yeah no it

what I was thinking I just can't say it

6050
02:15:29,709 --> 02:15:29,719
what I was thinking I just can't say it
 

6051
02:15:29,719 --> 02:15:31,750
what I was thinking I just can't say it
properly but the the rhyme the poem

6052
02:15:31,750 --> 02:15:31,760
properly but the the rhyme the poem
 

6053
02:15:31,760 --> 02:15:33,350
properly but the the rhyme the poem
thing makes a lot of sense cuz poems are

6054
02:15:33,350 --> 02:15:33,360
thing makes a lot of sense cuz poems are
 

6055

supposed to rhyme yeah and then you can
 

6057
02:15:36,480 --> 02:15:39,270
supposed to rhyme yeah and then you can
guess those words Latin words would

02:16:20,280 --> 02:16:21,549
pronounced in Engish way and then like
it was actually technically Roman

6092
02:16:21,549 --> 02:16:21,559
it was actually technically Roman
 

6093
02:16:21,559 --> 02:16:25,030
it was actually technically Roman
because Neptune uh Poseidon is the Greek

6094
02:16:25,030 --> 02:16:25,040
because Neptune uh Poseidon is the Greek
 

6095
02:16:25,040 --> 02:16:27,430
because Neptune uh Poseidon is the Greek
equivalent so they were actually the

6096
02:16:27,430 --> 02:16:27,440
equivalent so they were actually the
 

6097
02:16:27,440 --> 02:16:30,629

Sims
4 but not normally I have thought about

6366
02:22:14,429 --> 02:22:14,439
4 but not normally I have thought about
 

6367
02:22:14,439 --> 02:22:17,990
4 but not normally I have thought about
a challenge one of us like we'll keep on

6368
02:22:17,990 --> 02:22:18,000
a challenge one of us like we'll keep on
 

6369
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:21,230
a challenge one of us like we'll keep on
taking turns in controlling the Sim uh

6370
02:22:21,230 --> 02:22:21,240
taking turns in controlling the Sim uh
 

6371
02:22:21,240 --> 02:22:24,270
taking turns in controlling the Sim uh
like maybe 10 minutes or so one of us

6372
02:22:24,270 --> 02:22:24,280
like maybe 10 minutes or so one of us
 

6373
02:22:24,280 --> 02:22:28,389
like maybe 10 minutes or so one of us
will be the angle one of us will be the

6374
02:22:28,389 --> 02:22:28,399
will be the angle one of us will be the
 

6375
02:22:28,399 --> 02:22:30,910
will be the angle one of us will be the
debil well I can tell who's who based on

6376
02:22:30,910 --> 02:22:30,920
debil well I can tell who's who based on
 

6377
02:22:30,920 --> 02:22:34,950
debil well I can tell who's who based on
my horns I guess so yeah because we can

6378
02:22:34,950 --> 02:22:34,960
my horns I guess so yeah because we can
 

6379
02:22:34,960 --> 02:22:37,349
my horns I guess so yeah because we can
be either your angle or your

6380
02:22:37,349 --> 02:22:37,359
be either your angle or your
 

6381
02:22:37,359 --> 02:22:42,110
be either your angle or your
deil right and and so the angle will try

6382
02:22:42,110 --> 02:22:42,120
deil right and and so the angle will try
 

6383
02:22:42,120 --> 02:22:46,230
deil right and and so the angle will try
to uh help the Sim and keep him alive

6384
02:22:46,230 --> 02:22:46,240
to uh help the Sim and keep him alive
