3570
01:48:07,109 --> 01:48:07,119
but the thing that doesn't reset is tech
 

3571
01:48:07,119 --> 01:48:08,550
but the thing that doesn't reset is tech
tree and basically like you know

3572
01:48:08,550 --> 01:48:08,560
tree and basically like you know
 

3573
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:10,950
tree and basically like you know
blueprints and stuff like that

3574
01:48:10,950 --> 01:48:10,960
blueprints and stuff like that
 

3575
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:12,629

3578
01:48:13,910 --> 01:48:13,920
the smart thing to do because i don't
 

3579
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:15,510
the smart thing to do because i don't
have much time a lot of people have

3580
01:48:15,510 --> 01:48:15,520
have much time a lot of people have
 

3581

started from season one
and of course even though things reset

3584
01:48:20,790 --> 01:48:20,800
and of course even though things reset
 

3585
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:22,149
and of course even though things reset
they're still ahead in the when it comes

3586
01:48:22,149 --> 01:48:22,159
they're still ahead in the when it comes
 

3587
