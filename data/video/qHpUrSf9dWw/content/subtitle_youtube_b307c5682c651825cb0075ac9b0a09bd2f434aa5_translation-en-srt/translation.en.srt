5932
02:29:27,271 --> 02:29:30,680
but if we
can get underground,  I was talking about that,

5933
02:29:30,680 --> 02:29:30,690
can get underground,  I was talking about that,
 

5934
02:29:30,690 --> 02:29:33,890
can get underground,  I was talking about that,
but I'll stop here.

5935

from the end, from the end, chop ...  So you've
 

5940
02:29:43,381 --> 02:29:46,200

 

5941

cleared it,
 

5944
02:29:49,061 --> 02:29:50,930
cleared it,
right? It's

5945
02:29:50,930 --> 02:29:50,940
right? It's
 

5946
02:29:50,940 --> 02:29:54,440
right? It's
not like Suga 8 or anything, but first you've completed 2 and then it

5947
02:29:54,440 --> 02:29:54,450
not like Suga 8 or anything, but first you've completed 2 and then it
 

5948

was so bad,
 

5963
02:30:26,189 --> 02:30:29,990
was so bad,

want to stream it, but I can't, so I'll go and visit
 

6011
02:31:41,391 --> 02:31:45,820
want to stream it, but I can't, so I'll go and visit
. The same 3rd grade 6 most of the

6012
02:31:45,820 --> 02:31:45,830
. The same 3rd grade 6 most of the
 

6013
02:31:45,830 --> 02:31:48,961

02:31:50,640 --> 02:31:50,650
No,
 

6017
02:31:50,650 --> 02:31:53,911
No,
I'm just in the A building. I

6018
02:31:53,911 --> 02:31:53,921
I'm just in the A building. I
 

6019
02:31:53,921 --> 02:31:57,961
I'm just in the A building. I
think it was 100 hours last month.

6020
02:31:57,961 --> 02:31:57,971
think it was 100 hours last month.
 

6021
02:31:57,971 --> 02:32:01,230
think it was 100 hours last month.
That's a toy. It was like 150 hours. I

6022
02:32:01,230 --> 02:32:01,240
That's a toy. It was like 150 hours. I
 

6023
02:32:01,240 --> 02:32:04,040
That's a toy. It was like 150 hours. I
think that's what I said.

6024
02:32:04,040 --> 02:32:04,050
think that's what I said.
 

6025
02:32:04,050 --> 02:32:07,099
think that's what I said.
Do it for about two days. It's the same time.

6026
02:32:07,099 --> 02:32:07,109
Do it for about two days. It's the same time.
 

6027
02:32:07,109 --> 02:32:12,470
Do it for about two days. It's the same time.
Same time.  I'm going to use it. It

6028
02:32:12,470 --> 02:32:12,480
Same time.  I'm going to use it. It
 

6029
02:32:12,480 --> 02:32:15,801
Same time.  I'm going to use it. It
seems like you can't feel safe in India 24 hours a day.

6030
02:32:15,801 --> 02:32:15,811
seems like you can't feel safe in India 24 hours a day.
 

6031
02:32:15,811 --> 02:32:18,591
seems like you can't feel safe in India 24 hours a day.
But that's

6032
02:32:18,591 --> 02:32:18,601
But that's
 

6033
02:32:18,601 --> 02:32:23,150
But that's
true. I guess that's why Kaori is a member of the book. She's

6034
02:32:23,150 --> 02:32:23,160
true. I guess that's why Kaori is a member of the book. She's
 

6035
02:32:23,160 --> 02:32:26,060
true. I guess that's why Kaori is a member of the book. She's
doing the back-up, but she has a break in between.

6036
02:32:26,060 --> 02:32:26,070
doing the back-up, but she has a break in between.
 

6037
02:32:26,070 --> 02:32:26,841
doing the back-up, but she has a break in between.

6038
02:32:26,841 --> 02:32:26,851

 

6039
02:32:26,851 --> 02:32:30,560

Well, she's taking a fairly short time.  I

6040
02:32:30,560 --> 02:32:30,570
Well, she's taking a fairly short time.  I
 

6041
02:32:30,570 --> 02:32:34,170
Well, she's taking a fairly short time.  I
often take diagonal frames, so I get 6 hours

6042
02:32:34,170 --> 02:32:34,180
often take diagonal frames, so I get 6 hours
 

6043
02:32:34,180 --> 02:32:37,050
often take diagonal frames, so I get 6 hours
, 7 hours, or 8 hours, but sometimes I get 9 hours or 10 hours.

6044
02:32:37,050 --> 02:32:38,969
, 7 hours, or 8 hours, but sometimes I get 9 hours or 10 hours.
 

6045
02:32:38,969 --> 02:32:38,979

 

6046
02:32:38,979 --> 02:32:44,640

If I take a break and do 9 hours a day, I

6047
02:32:44,640 --> 02:32:44,650
If I take a break and do 9 hours a day, I
 

6048
02:32:44,650 --> 02:32:49,530
If I take a break and do 9 hours a day, I
might be able to get my money's worth.  It's

6049
02:32:49,530 --> 02:32:49,540
might be able to get my money's worth.  It's
 

6050
02:32:49,540 --> 02:32:51,871
might be able to get my money's worth.  It's
forbidden to push yourself too hard, you know

6051
02:32:51,871 --> 02:32:53,980
forbidden to push yourself too hard, you know
 

6052
02:32:53,980 --> 02:32:57,011

 

6053
02:32:57,011 --> 02:32:58,720

 

6054
02:32:58,720 --> 02:32:58,730

 

6055
02:32:58,730 --> 02:32:59,801


6056
02:32:59,801 --> 02:32:59,811

 

6057
02:32:59,811 --> 02:33:01,300

? Once you start streaming, it's hard, and you just keep going without taking a break. You know, you

6058
02:33:01,300 --> 02:33:03,729
? Once you start streaming, it's hard, and you just keep going without taking a break. You know, you
 

6059
02:33:03,729 --> 02:33:03,739

 

6060
02:33:03,739 --> 02:33:06,910

always feel that hunger, like you want to see it through to the end.

6061
02:33:06,910 --> 02:33:06,920
always feel that hunger, like you want to see it through to the end.
 

6062
02:33:06,920 --> 02:33:08,769
always feel that hunger, like you want to see it through to the end.
Yes,

02:33:08,779 --> 02:33:11,479
Yes,
yes.

6065
02:33:11,479 --> 02:33:11,489

 

6066
02:33:11,489 --> 02:33:15,770

But it's really the Grachan that's doing it.  That

6067
02:33:15,770 --> 02:33:15,780
But it's really the Grachan that's doing it.  That
 

6068
02:33:15,780 --> 02:33:19,580
But it's really the Grachan that's doing it.  That
amount of rain is so bad that I'm worried. Do

6069
02:33:19,580 --> 02:33:19,590
amount of rain is so bad that I'm worried. Do
 

6070
02:33:19,590 --> 02:33:23,270
amount of rain is so bad that I'm worried. Do
n't do anything. If it's necessary, I'll tell you. I

6071
02:33:23,270 --> 02:33:23,280
n't do anything. If it's necessary, I'll tell you. I
 

6072
02:33:23,280 --> 02:33:25,881
n't do anything. If it's necessary, I'll tell you. I
might have pushed myself too hard. It's

6073
02:33:25,881 --> 02:33:25,891
might have pushed myself too hard. It's
 

6074
02:33:25,891 --> 02:33:28,160
might have pushed myself too hard. It's
not something that might have been equipment, but something else. I do

6075
02:33:28,160 --> 02:33:29,830
not something that might have been equipment, but something else. I do
 

6076
02:33:29,830 --> 02:33:29,840

 

6077
02:33:29,840 --> 02:33:33,080

n't know what the damage is.  I'm

6078
02:33:33,080 --> 02:33:36,590
