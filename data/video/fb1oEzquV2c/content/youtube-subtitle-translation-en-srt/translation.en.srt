1597
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:18,110

that Burgchat. For

1602
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:32,590

Even though Nisun's group chat is a

1603
01:17:32,590 --> 01:17:32,600

 

1604
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:34,669

group,

1605
01:17:34,669 --> 01:17:37,550
group,
 

1606
01:17:37,550 --> 01:17:37,560

 

1607
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:40,870

it's a group, right? It's a

1608
01:17:40,870 --> 01:17:40,880
it's a group, right? It's a
 

1609
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:43,110
it's a group, right? It's a
group, so it's a create group.  I'm going to

1610
01:17:43,110 --> 01:17:47,270
group, so it's a create group.  I'm going to
 

1611
01:17:47,270 --> 01:17:47,280

 

1612
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:52,110

make it, so I'll wait and let you know when it's

1613
01:17:52,110 --> 01:17:52,120
make it, so I'll wait and let you know when it's
 

1614
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:55,510
make it, so I'll wait and let you know when it's
done. It's done tomorrow. It probably won't come in.

1615
01:17:55,510 --> 01:17:55,520
done. It's done tomorrow. It probably won't come in.
 

1616
01:17:55,520 --> 01:18:01,630
done. It's done tomorrow. It probably won't come in.
So what's the point?

1617
01:18:01,630 --> 01:18:01,640

 

1618
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:11,709

[Laughs] Yeah,

1619
01:18:11,709 --> 01:18:11,719

 

1620
01:18:11,719 --> 01:18:26,140

put it in.

1621
01:18:26,140 --> 01:18:26,150

 

1622
01:18:26,150 --> 01:18:50,990

[Laughs] I

1623
01:18:50,990 --> 01:18:51,000

 

1624
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,709

want it. It's

1625
01:18:53,709 --> 01:18:53,719

 

1626
01:18:53,719 --> 01:18:57,030


1627
01:18:57,030 --> 01:18:57,040

 

1628
01:18:57,040 --> 01:19:01,310

Ruru. It says, ``Hey, password.''  I do

1629
01:19:01,310 --> 01:19:01,320
Ruru. It says, ``Hey, password.''  I do
 

1630
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:05,709
Ruru. It says, ``Hey, password.''  I do
n't know what it is, I don't know who it is.

1631
01:19:05,709 --> 01:19:05,719
n't know what it is, I don't know who it is.
 

1632
01:19:05,719 --> 01:19:10,350
n't know what it is, I don't know who it is.
Yeah, it's about 1111. Yeah, it's about

1633
01:19:10,350 --> 01:19:10,360
Yeah, it's about 1111. Yeah, it's about
 

1634
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:11,950
Yeah, it's about 1111. Yeah, it's about
11. Maybe I'll

1635
01:19:11,950 --> 01:19:11,960
11. Maybe I'll
 

1636
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:15,790
11. Maybe I'll
change my password later,

1637
01:19:15,790 --> 01:19:15,800
change my password later,
 

1638
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:20,629
change my password later,
so I guess I'll just use 1 for

1639
01:19:20,629 --> 01:19:20,639
so I guess I'll just use 1 for
 

1640
01:19:20,639 --> 01:19:25,669
so I guess I'll just use 1 for
now. Yeah, I'm using that voice, that chat, so...  I

1641
01:19:25,669 --> 01:19:25,679
now. Yeah, I'm using that voice, that chat, so...  I
 

1642
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:28,430
now. Yeah, I'm using that voice, that chat, so...  I
can't hear the voice of the team, right,

1643
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:28,440
can't hear the voice of the team, right,
 

1644
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:30,790
can't hear the voice of the team, right,
right, right, right, so we can have a conversation in chat.
