still continue to
 

10655
04:35:11,760 --> 04:35:14,150
still continue to
try to be very vague about where they

10656
04:35:14,150 --> 04:35:14,160
try to be very vague about where they
 

10657
04:35:14,160 --> 04:35:15,670
try to be very vague about where they
are

10658
04:35:15,670 --> 04:35:15,680
are
 

10659
04:35:15,680 --> 04:35:17,830
are
and where they're from

10660
04:35:17,830 --> 04:35:17,840
and where they're from
 

10661
04:35:17,840 --> 04:35:19,670
and where they're from
you know for the japanese girls is like

10662
04:35:19,670 --> 04:35:19,680
you know for the japanese girls is like
 

10663
04:35:19,680 --> 04:35:22,390
you know for the japanese girls is like
pretty obvious you know we know pretty

10664
04:35:22,390 --> 04:35:22,400
pretty obvious you know we know pretty
 

10665
04:35:22,400 --> 04:35:24,070
pretty obvious you know we know pretty
much

10666
04:35:24,070 --> 04:35:24,080
much
 

10667
04:35:24,080 --> 04:35:25,349
much
you know where they're from and where

10668
04:35:25,349 --> 04:35:25,359
you know where they're from and where
 

10669
04:35:25,359 --> 04:35:26,470
you know where they're from and where
they are

10670
04:35:26,470 --> 04:35:26,480
they are
 

10671
04:35:26,480 --> 04:35:28,949
they are
but for the ian girls they're

10672
04:35:28,949 --> 04:35:28,959
but for the ian girls they're
 

10673
04:35:28,959 --> 04:35:31,029
but for the ian girls they're
scattered over the globe or they could

10674
04:35:31,029 --> 04:35:31,039
scattered over the globe or they could
 

10675
04:35:31,039 --> 04:35:31,830
scattered over the globe or they could
be

10676
04:35:31,830 --> 04:35:31,840
be
 

10677
04:35:31,840 --> 04:35:32,789
be
so

10678
04:35:32,789 --> 04:35:32,799
so
 

10679
04:35:32,799 --> 04:35:35,189
so
they could be anywhere

10680
04:35:35,189 --> 04:35:35,199
they could be anywhere
 

10681
04:35:35,199 --> 04:35:36,551
they could be anywhere
so it's

10682
04:35:36,551 --> 04:35:36,561
so it's
 

10683
04:35:36,561 --> 04:35:39,670
so it's
more reasonable to try to keep the

10684
04:35:39,670 --> 04:35:39,680
more reasonable to try to keep the
 

10685
04:35:39,680 --> 04:35:41,910
more reasonable to try to keep the
security and privacy protected

10686
04:35:41,910 --> 04:35:41,920
security and privacy protected
 

10687
04:35:41,920 --> 04:35:43,349
security and privacy protected
and just not

10688
04:35:43,349 --> 04:35:43,359
and just not
 

10689
04:35:43,359 --> 04:35:45,590
and just not
say it but you know how long that worked

10690
04:35:45,590 --> 04:35:45,600
say it but you know how long that worked
 

10691
04:35:45,600 --> 04:35:48,390
say it but you know how long that worked
out for me especially like i can't debut

10692
04:35:48,390 --> 04:35:48,400
out for me especially like i can't debut
 

10693
04:35:48,400 --> 04:35:49,269
out for me especially like i can't debut
and then

10694
04:35:49,269 --> 04:35:49,279
and then
 

10695
04:35:49,279 --> 04:35:51,349
and then
not mention the fact that

10696
04:35:51,349 --> 04:35:51,359
not mention the fact that
 

10697
04:35:51,359 --> 04:35:53,910
not mention the fact that
i speak fluent german and then you would

10698
04:35:53,910 --> 04:35:53,920
i speak fluent german and then you would
 

10699
04:35:53,920 --> 04:35:55,590
i speak fluent german and then you would
hear from when i talked that english

10700
04:35:55,590 --> 04:35:55,600
hear from when i talked that english
 

10701
04:35:55,600 --> 04:35:57,349
hear from when i talked that english
isn't my first language so you would

10702
04:35:57,349 --> 04:35:57,359
isn't my first language so you would
 

10703
04:35:57,359 --> 04:35:59,590
isn't my first language so you would
probably assume at some point

10704
04:35:59,590 --> 04:35:59,600
probably assume at some point
 

10705
04:35:59,600 --> 04:36:00,789
probably assume at some point
then

10706
04:36:00,789 --> 04:36:00,799
then
 

10707
04:36:00,799 --> 04:36:02,551
then
yeah my first language is german and

10708
04:36:02,551 --> 04:36:02,561
yeah my first language is german and
 

10709
04:36:02,561 --> 04:36:04,551
yeah my first language is german and
then whole i wonder

10710
04:36:04,551 --> 04:36:04,561
then whole i wonder
 

10711
04:36:04,561 --> 04:36:06,230
then whole i wonder
if her first language is german then

10712
04:36:06,230 --> 04:36:06,240
if her first language is german then
 

10713
04:36:06,240 --> 04:36:07,990
if her first language is german then
there's not much choices of where she

10714
04:36:07,990 --> 04:36:08,000
there's not much choices of where she
 

10715
04:36:08,000 --> 04:36:09,990
there's not much choices of where she
could be from

10716
04:36:09,990 --> 04:36:10,000
could be from
 

10717
04:36:10,000 --> 04:36:11,429
