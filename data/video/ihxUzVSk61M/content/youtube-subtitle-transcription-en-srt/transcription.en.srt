without booking one of those seating
 

11893
06:33:58,558 --> 06:34:00,750

areas just but like you know you can

11894
06:34:00,750 --> 06:34:00,760
areas just but like you know you can
 

11895
06:34:00,760 --> 06:34:03,070
areas just but like you know you can
stand around it's still experience it

11899
06:34:05,240 --> 06:34:09,030
and then it's like I don't know 600 EUR
or so maybe I don't know 400 600 which

11900
06:34:09,030 --> 06:34:09,040
or so maybe I don't know 400 600 which
 

11901
06:34:09,040 --> 06:34:12,468
or so maybe I don't know 400 600 which
is much cheaper than getting one of the

11902
06:34:12,468 --> 06:34:12,478
is much cheaper than getting one of the

13332
07:10:10,830 --> 07:10:10,840
just one 2 three 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 10 okay
 

13333
07:10:10,840 --> 07:10:12,708
just one 2 three 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 10 okay
then we can round it up to 12 episodes

13334
07:10:12,708 --> 07:10:12,718
then we can round it up to 12 episodes
 

13335
07:10:12,718 --> 07:10:14,510
then we can round it up to 12 episodes
if 5 hours is like 10 episodes we can

13336
07:10:14,510 --> 07:10:14,520
if 5 hours is like 10 episodes we can
 

13337
07:10:14,520 --> 07:10:18,270
if 5 hours is like 10 episodes we can
just do one more round it up to six

13338
07:10:18,270 --> 07:10:18,280
just do one more round it up to six
 

13339
07:10:18,280 --> 07:10:19,948
just do one more round it up to six
episodes and then we have a full season

13340
07:10:19,948 --> 07:10:19,958
episodes and then we have a full season
 

13341
07:10:19,958 --> 07:10:25,468
episodes and then we have a full season
in one go

13342
07:10:25,468 --> 07:10:25,478

 

13343
07:10:25,478 --> 07:10:27,350

yeah I don't know where I got that 300

13344
07:10:27,350 --> 07:10:27,360
yeah I don't know where I got that 300
 

13345
07:10:27,360 --> 07:10:30,590
yeah I don't know where I got that 300
number

13346
07:10:30,590 --> 07:10:30,600

 

13347
07:10:30,600 --> 07:10:33,590

from uh it's 13 episodes maybe depends

13348
07:10:33,590 --> 07:10:33,600
from uh it's 13 episodes maybe depends
 

13349
07:10:33,600 --> 07:10:36,628
from uh it's 13 episodes maybe depends
on the season

13350
07:10:36,628 --> 07:10:36,638

 

13351
07:10:36,638 --> 07:10:39,150

right I think we can wipe some of these

13352
07:10:39,150 --> 07:10:39,160
right I think we can wipe some of these
 

13353
07:10:39,160 --> 07:10:43,670
right I think we can wipe some of these
Seasons out in one go in one

13354
07:10:43,670 --> 07:10:43,680

 

13355
07:10:43,680 --> 07:10:46,468

stream and then I thought it would take

13356
07:10:46,468 --> 07:10:46,478
stream and then I thought it would take
 

13357
07:10:46,478 --> 07:10:49,150
stream and then I thought it would take
up like three months of member streams

13358
07:10:49,150 --> 07:10:49,160
up like three months of member streams
 

13359
07:10:49,160 --> 07:10:52,388
up like three months of member streams
but then it's not that bad and maybe

13360
07:10:52,388 --> 07:10:52,398
but then it's not that bad and maybe
 

13361
07:10:52,398 --> 07:10:54,548
but then it's not that bad and maybe
maybe maybe after watching one full

13362
07:10:54,548 --> 07:10:54,558
maybe maybe after watching one full
 

13363
07:10:54,558 --> 07:10:57,070
maybe maybe after watching one full
season I think it would be good to have

13364
07:10:57,070 --> 07:10:57,080
season I think it would be good to have
 

13365
07:10:57,080 --> 07:10:59,190
season I think it would be good to have
one member stream so okay I think we can

13366
07:10:59,190 --> 07:10:59,200
one member stream so okay I think we can
 

13367
07:10:59,200 --> 07:11:02,350
one member stream so okay I think we can
do it like this one week we watch a full

13368
07:11:02,350 --> 07:11:02,360
do it like this one week we watch a full
 

13369
07:11:02,360 --> 07:11:06,110
do it like this one week we watch a full
season in one go 6 hours the next week I

13370
07:11:06,110 --> 07:11:06,120
season in one go 6 hours the next week I
 

13371
07:11:06,120 --> 07:11:07,868
season in one go 6 hours the next week I
still do a normal member stream then

13372
07:11:07,868 --> 07:11:07,878
