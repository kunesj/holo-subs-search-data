00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:39,240
preferring dresses but generally let's
 

345
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,930
preferring dresses but generally let's
say you go somewhere for five days and

346
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:41,940
say you go somewhere for five days and
 

347
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,490
say you go somewhere for five days and
you want to pack only dresses then you

348
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:43,500
you want to pack only dresses then you
 

349
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,110
you want to pack only dresses then you
need like five different dresses but if

350
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:45,120
need like five different dresses but if
 

351
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,210
need like five different dresses but if
you were if you wear pants then you just

352
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:47,220
you were if you wear pants then you just
 

353
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,370
you were if you wear pants then you just
need maybe one or two pairs of pants and

354
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:49,380
need maybe one or two pairs of pants and

need maybe one or two pairs of pants and
then maybe five different shirts or so

356
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:50,820
then maybe five different shirts or so
 

357
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,970
then maybe five different shirts or so
so maybe it's more efficient to wear

358
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:52,980
so maybe it's more efficient to wear
