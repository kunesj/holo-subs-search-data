04:03:33,830 --> 04:03:33,840
uh and that could perhaps
 

9753
04:03:33,840 --> 04:03:35,590

and what what i aim
 

12479
05:10:27,440 --> 05:10:29,910
and what what i aim
the length of the stream to be

12480
05:10:29,910 --> 05:10:29,920
the length of the stream to be
 

12481
05:10:29,920 --> 05:10:31,990
the length of the stream to be
because i don't want them to be too long

12482
05:10:31,990 --> 05:10:32,000
because i don't want them to be too long
 

12483

if it's just like the volcano and some
lava flowing down if that kills the

lava flowing down if that kills the
 

13203
05:26:56,638 --> 05:27:00,470

13205
05:27:00,480 --> 05:27:02,628
