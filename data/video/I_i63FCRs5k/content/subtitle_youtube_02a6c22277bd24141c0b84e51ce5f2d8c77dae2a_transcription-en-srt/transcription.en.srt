a bit difficult if it's like it when
 

4106
01:48:27,540 --> 01:48:30,050
a bit difficult if it's like it when
it's wrapped in a paper like this I I

4107
01:48:30,050 --> 01:48:30,060
it's wrapped in a paper like this I I
 

4108

agree it can be difficult you need like
 

4110
01:48:31,739 --> 01:48:33,770
agree it can be difficult you need like
a technique and and then the other

4111
01:48:33,770 --> 01:48:33,780
a technique and and then the other
 

4112
01:48:33,780 --> 01:48:36,050
a technique and and then the other
problem was that it was so soft that you

4113
01:48:36,050 --> 01:48:36,060
problem was that it was so soft that you
 

4114
01:48:36,060 --> 01:48:39,229
problem was that it was so soft that you
basically you could not like pull it out

4115
01:48:39,229 --> 01:48:39,239
basically you could not like pull it out
 

4116
01:48:39,239 --> 01:48:40,850
basically you could not like pull it out
of the paper so once you got to the

4117
01:48:40,850 --> 01:48:40,860
of the paper so once you got to the
 

4118
01:48:40,860 --> 01:48:42,770
of the paper so once you got to the
point where the paper starts

4119
01:48:42,770 --> 01:48:42,780
point where the paper starts
 

4120
01:48:42,780 --> 01:48:45,350
point where the paper starts
you can't bite into it anymore unless

4121
01:48:45,350 --> 01:48:45,360
you can't bite into it anymore unless
 

4122
01:48:45,360 --> 01:48:48,830
you can't bite into it anymore unless
you pull it out or you you rip off the

4123
01:48:48,830 --> 01:48:48,840
you pull it out or you you rip off the
 

4124
01:48:48,840 --> 01:48:51,169
you pull it out or you you rip off the
paper but she couldn't really pull it

4125
01:48:51,169 --> 01:48:51,179
paper but she couldn't really pull it
 

4126
01:48:51,179 --> 01:48:53,689
paper but she couldn't really pull it
out because it was so soft it would rip

4127
01:48:53,689 --> 01:48:53,699
out because it was so soft it would rip
 

4128
01:48:53,699 --> 01:48:55,910
out because it was so soft it would rip
and she would be you know

4129
01:48:55,910 --> 01:48:55,920
and she would be you know
 

4130
01:48:55,920 --> 01:48:57,890
and she would be you know
messing it all up

4131
01:48:57,890 --> 01:48:57,900
messing it all up
 

4132
01:48:57,900 --> 01:49:00,470
messing it all up
I was trying to help her but it was

4133
01:49:00,470 --> 01:49:00,480
I was trying to help her but it was
 

4134
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:01,850
I was trying to help her but it was
difficult she was struggling with it

4135
01:49:01,850 --> 01:49:01,860
difficult she was struggling with it
 

4136
01:49:01,860 --> 01:49:04,430
difficult she was struggling with it
because of the texture and all that but

4137
01:49:04,430 --> 01:49:04,440
because of the texture and all that but
 

4138
01:49:04,440 --> 01:49:06,709
because of the texture and all that but
she enjoyed it yeah

4139
01:49:06,709 --> 01:49:06,719
she enjoyed it yeah
 

4140
01:49:06,719 --> 01:49:09,470
she enjoyed it yeah
so we ate that and and drank that and

4141
01:49:09,470 --> 01:49:09,480
so we ate that and and drank that and
 

4142
01:49:09,480 --> 01:49:11,390
so we ate that and and drank that and
then we moved on and I was hoping to

4143
01:49:11,390 --> 01:49:11,400
then we moved on and I was hoping to
 

4144
01:49:11,400 --> 01:49:15,310
then we moved on and I was hoping to
finally reach the actual

4145
01:49:15,310 --> 01:49:15,320
finally reach the actual
 

4146
01:49:15,320 --> 01:49:19,149
finally reach the actual
destination but eventually
