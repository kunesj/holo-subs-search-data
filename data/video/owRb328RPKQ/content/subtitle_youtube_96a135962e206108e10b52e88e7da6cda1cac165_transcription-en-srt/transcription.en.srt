special segment segment that we can do
 

1005

special segment segment that we can do
in between the questions because

1006
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:27,440
in between the questions because
 

1007
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,909
in between the questions because
i guess like fubuki zamba is a really

1008
00:28:29,909 --> 00:28:29,919
i guess like fubuki zamba is a really
 

1009
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:31,190
i guess like fubuki zamba is a really
special case

1010
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:31,200
special case
 

1011
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,990
special case
she has so much to offer so much to talk

1012
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:34,000
she has so much to offer so much to talk
 

1013
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,630
she has so much to offer so much to talk
about

1014
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:34,640
about
 

1015
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,029
about
and so many impressions she can do so

1016
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:37,039
and so many impressions she can do so
 

1017
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,190
and so many impressions she can do so
many contests she has won

1018
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:39,200
many contests she has won
 

1019
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,430
many contests she has won
so she's a very special case but there

1020
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:43,440
so she's a very special case but there
 

1021
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,870
so she's a very special case but there
might be other members where

1022
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:44,880
might be other members where
 

1023
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,310
might be other members where
i don't have so many i mean i would

1024
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:48,320
i don't have so many i mean i would
 

1025
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,830
i don't have so many i mean i would
all of them are special but there might

1026
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:49,840
all of them are special but there might
 

1027
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,750
all of them are special but there might
be members where it's a bit

1028
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:51,760
be members where it's a bit
 

1029
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,630
be members where it's a bit
harder for me to get that kind of stuff

1030
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:54,640
harder for me to get that kind of stuff
 

1031
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,510
harder for me to get that kind of stuff
out of them

1032
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:55,520
out of them
 

1033
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,310
out of them
so for that a special segment would

1034
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:58,320
so for that a special segment would
 

1035
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:58,870
so for that a special segment would
might be

1036
00:28:58,870 --> 00:28:58,880
might be
 

1037
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:04,350

i mean i must say that i could have done
 

1771
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,710
i mean i must say that i could have done
this uh even without being in japan

1772

obviously it was not necessary for me to

1774
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:03,200
obviously it was not necessary for me to
 

1775
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,390

be in japan
 

1777
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,549
