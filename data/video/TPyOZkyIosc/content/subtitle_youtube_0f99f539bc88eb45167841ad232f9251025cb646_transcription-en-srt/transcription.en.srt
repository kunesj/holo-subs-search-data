role play right exactly yeah but we all

556
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:02,560
role play right exactly yeah but we all
 

557
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,910
role play right exactly yeah but we all
will be able to tell the difference

558
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:03,920
will be able to tell the difference
 

559
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,829
will be able to tell the difference
between when you're in character and out

560
00:14:05,829 --> 00:14:05,839
between when you're in character and out
 

561
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:06,550
between when you're in character and out
of character

562
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:06,560
of character
 

563
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,710
of character
hopefully if we can't hey that's that's

564
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:08,720
hopefully if we can't hey that's that's
 

565
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,230
hopefully if we can't hey that's that's
probably part of the fun it's okay

566
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:10,240
probably part of the fun it's okay
 

567
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,990
probably part of the fun it's okay
we'll we'll roll with it you know um

568
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:14,000
we'll we'll roll with it you know um
 

569
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,550
we'll we'll roll with it you know um
and so yeah every system is different

570
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:16,560
and so yeah every system is different
 

571
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,910
and so yeah every system is different
for the most part

572
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:17,920
for the most part
 

573
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,189
for the most part
um like for example chiara you said that

574
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:21,199
um like for example chiara you said that
 

575
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,030
um like for example chiara you said that
you've played dnd well world of darkness

576
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,040
you've played dnd well world of darkness
 

577
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,269
you've played dnd well world of darkness
is

578
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:23,279
is
 

579
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,949
is
is quite different i would say for

580
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:24,959
is quite different i would say for
 

581
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,870
is quite different i would say for
example one big difference is that we

582
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:26,880
example one big difference is that we
 

583
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,189
example one big difference is that we
use

584
00:14:27,189 --> 00:14:27,199
use
 

585
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,629
use
d10s not d20s ah

586
00:14:30,629 --> 00:14:30,639
d10s not d20s ah
 

587
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:31,990
d10s not d20s ah
do you guys know what is that a detail

588
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:32,000
do you guys know what is that a detail
 

589
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,750
do you guys know what is that a detail
it's a d10 all right

590

it's a d10 all right
so a d10 well a d20 you know is a

592
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:36,480
so a d10 well a d20 you know is a
 

593
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,829
so a d10 well a d20 you know is a
20-sided die

594
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:37,839
20-sided die
 

595
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,870
20-sided die
right oh yeah a d10

596
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:40,880
right oh yeah a d10
 

597
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,310
right oh yeah a d10
is a 10-sided die so d just stands for

598
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:44,320
is a 10-sided die so d just stands for
 

599
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,750
is a 10-sided die so d just stands for
dice exactly

600
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:49,760

 

601
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,949

okay yeah yeah um so the main

602
00:14:52,949 --> 00:14:52,959
okay yeah yeah um so the main
 

603
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,430
okay yeah yeah um so the main
yeah we'll be using d10s for this system

604
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:55,440
yeah we'll be using d10s for this system
 

605
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:55,990
yeah we'll be using d10s for this system
um

606
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:56,000
um
 

607
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,069
um
and basically rolling those dice will

608
00:14:58,069 --> 00:14:58,079
and basically rolling those dice will
 

609
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,470
and basically rolling those dice will
determine uh your ability to perform an

610

it's a play on words here so it could

890
00:20:22,149 --> 00:20:22,159
it's a play on words here so it could
 

891
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,750
it's a play on words here so it could
sound like prison cell right

892
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:23,760
sound like prison cell right
 

893
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,909
sound like prison cell right
but you see there are actually uh three

894
00:20:25,909 --> 00:20:25,919
but you see there are actually uh three
 

895
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,789

tiers of organization in hunter society
 

897
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,990
tiers of organization in hunter society
okay first you've got cells basically

898
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:32,000
okay first you've got cells basically
 

899
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,950
okay first you've got cells basically
um there's there's the basic human human

900
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:34,960
um there's there's the basic human human
 

901
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,430
um there's there's the basic human human
human

902
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:35,440
human
 

903
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,630
human
unit hunter unit

904
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:38,640
unit hunter unit
 

905
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,710
unit hunter unit
humans a huge unit of hunter society

906
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:42,720
humans a huge unit of hunter society
 

907
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,870
humans a huge unit of hunter society
typically a small group of people who

908
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:44,880
typically a small group of people who
 

909
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,430
typically a small group of people who
defend their neighborhood or community

910

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,110
defend their neighborhood or community
so there may be there may be several

912
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:49,120
so there may be there may be several
 

913
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,110
so there may be there may be several
cells for example operating in a city at

914
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:51,120
cells for example operating in a city at
 

915
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,149
cells for example operating in a city at
one time

916
00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:52,159
one time
 

917
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,190
one time
so you guys are a small hunter cell

918
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:55,200
so you guys are a small hunter cell
 

919
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,630
so you guys are a small hunter cell
apparently ah right next up

920
00:20:58,630 --> 00:20:58,640
apparently ah right next up
 

921
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,710
apparently ah right next up
on the next level you've got compacts

922
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:00,720
on the next level you've got compacts
 

923
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,630
on the next level you've got compacts
yeah exactly

924
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:02,640
yeah exactly
 

925
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,510
yeah exactly
though yeah one whole brain cell between

926
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:05,520
though yeah one whole brain cell between
 

927
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,789
though yeah one whole brain cell between
between the four of you

928
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:08,799

 

929
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,149

yeah we're used to it yeah so after

930
00:21:12,149 --> 00:21:12,159
yeah we're used to it yeah so after
 

931
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,310
yeah we're used to it yeah so after
cells are compacts they're basically the

932
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:14,320
cells are compacts they're basically the
 

933
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,510
cells are compacts they're basically the
second tier

934
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:15,520
second tier
 

935
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,270
second tier
of organization found in hunter the

936
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:17,280
of organization found in hunter the
 

937
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,549
of organization found in hunter the
vigil so they're

938
00:21:18,549 --> 00:21:18,559
vigil so they're
 

939
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,390
vigil so they're
basically organized cells of hunters

940
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:20,400
basically organized cells of hunters
 

941
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,470
basically organized cells of hunters
dedicated to a common purpose but

942
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:22,480
dedicated to a common purpose but
 

943
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,950
dedicated to a common purpose but
still compared to conspiracies they're

944
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:24,960
still compared to conspiracies they're
 

945
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,310
still compared to conspiracies they're
pretty much baby town

946
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:26,320
pretty much baby town
 

947
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,549
pretty much baby town
you know they're they're new unstable

948
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:28,559
you know they're they're new unstable
 

949
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,070
you know they're they're new unstable
the members fight a lot

950
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:30,080
the members fight a lot
 

951
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,549
the members fight a lot
they're easy to find and join but you

952
00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:32,559
they're easy to find and join but you
 

953
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:33,350
they're easy to find and join but you
know

954
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:33,360
know
 

955
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,270
know
it's still not quite conspiracy exactly

956
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:37,280
it's still not quite conspiracy exactly
 

957
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,549
it's still not quite conspiracy exactly
is it worth it exactly you guys may

958
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:40,559
is it worth it exactly you guys may
 

959
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:41,909
is it worth it exactly you guys may
encounter several

960
00:21:41,909 --> 00:21:41,919
encounter several
 

961
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,789
encounter several
compacts as well as conspiracies along

962
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:44,799
compacts as well as conspiracies along
 

963
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,310
compacts as well as conspiracies along
the way other hunters that are doing

964
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:46,320
the way other hunters that are doing
 

965
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,590
the way other hunters that are doing
their jobs

right so the conspiracies are the
 

969
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,710
right so the conspiracies are the
highest tier of hunter society

970
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:52,720
highest tier of hunter society
 

971
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,390
highest tier of hunter society
and they've got a lot of resources

972
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:54,400
and they've got a lot of resources
 

973
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,549
and they've got a lot of resources
they're run by very powerful people

974
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:56,559
they're run by very powerful people
 

975
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,149
they're run by very powerful people

one of the most central roles in this

2180
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:26,160
one of the most central roles in this
 

2181
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,030
one of the most central roles in this
game which is a perception check

2182
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:29,040
game which is a perception check
 

2183
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,950
game which is a perception check
perception check is basically to look

2184
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:30,960
perception check is basically to look
 

2185
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,870
perception check is basically to look
around you roll to look around and see

2186
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:32,880
around you roll to look around and see
 

2187
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,390
around you roll to look around and see
what the f word is going on

2188
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:34,400
what the f word is going on
 

2189
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:39,430
what the f word is going on
sanity check yes

2190
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:39,440

 

2191
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,069

a little different but the the the the

2192
00:46:42,069 --> 00:46:42,079
a little different but the the the the
 

2193
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:44,470
a little different but the the the the
sentiment is there

2194
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:44,480
sentiment is there
 

2195
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,589
sentiment is there
so basically the perception check is

2196
00:46:47,589 --> 00:46:47,599
so basically the perception check is
 

2197
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:50,150

dots so for example say that you have

2202
00:46:59,190 --> 00:46:59,200
dots so for example say that you have
 

2203
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,270
dots so for example say that you have
this is just for example you have to

2204
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:01,280
this is just for example you have to
 

2205
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,470
this is just for example you have to
resolve

2206
00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:02,480
resolve
 

2207

00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:08,480
when i say rule perception you you do
 

2211
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,190
when i say rule perception you you do
the math

2212
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:09,200
the math
 

2213
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,150
the math
resolve two plus three composure you

2214
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:12,160
resolve two plus three composure you
 

2215
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:18,069
resolve two plus three composure you
roll five d10s

2217
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:20,870

and basically um how many successes you

2218
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:20,880
and basically um how many successes you
 

2219
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:21,270
and basically um how many successes you
get

well chad has quite a bit of dexterity
 

2305
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:03,910
well chad has quite a bit of dexterity
so we'll give him two dots

2306
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:03,920
so we'll give him two dots
 

2307
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:07,349
so we'll give him two dots
more in stamina and then two more in

2308
00:49:07,349 --> 00:49:07,359
more in stamina and then two more in

00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:50,960
up youtube uh so that you can see it

there
 

2441
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:55,430
there
um but yeah three four five so there are

2442
00:51:55,430 --> 00:51:55,440
um but yeah three four five so there are
 

2443
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,589
um but yeah three four five so there are
three boxes

2444
00:51:57,589 --> 00:51:57,599
three boxes
 

2445
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:00,950
three boxes
and so each one is split up um to where

2446
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:00,960
and so each one is split up um to where
 

2447
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,710
and so each one is split up um to where
you can put either five dots

2448
00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:02,720
you can put either five dots
 

2449
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:06,790

is going to be so for example your
 

2455
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:11,349
is going to be so for example your
character

2456
00:52:11,349 --> 00:52:11,359
character
 

2457
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:12,710

3736
01:19:14,790 --> 01:19:14,800
about that
 

3737
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:18,870
about that
um and let's see next initiative mod

3738
01:19:18,870 --> 01:19:18,880
um and let's see next initiative mod
 

3739
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:20,550
um and let's see next initiative mod
this is really important because when

3740
01:19:20,550 --> 01:19:20,560
this is really important because when
 

3741
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:23,030
this is really important because when
you roll dice for your initiative mod

3742
01:19:23,030 --> 01:19:23,040
you roll dice for your initiative mod
 

3743
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:24,550

3745
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:27,830
it's going to determine the turn
order so

3746
01:19:27,830 --> 01:19:27,840
order so
 

3747
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:29,990
order so
your initiative mod is dexterity plus

3748
01:19:29,990 --> 01:19:30,000
your initiative mod is dexterity plus
 

3749
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:34,630
your initiative mod is dexterity plus
composure

3750
01:19:34,630 --> 01:19:34,640

 

3751
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:37,910

for chad oh no chad's initiative mod is

3752
01:19:37,910 --> 01:19:37,920
for chad oh no chad's initiative mod is
 

3753
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:41,030
for chad oh no chad's initiative mod is
only two

3754
01:19:41,030 --> 01:19:41,040

 

3755
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:44,709

which means chad will roll one d10

3756
01:19:44,709 --> 01:19:44,719
which means chad will roll one d10
 

3757
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:48,950
which means chad will roll one d10
plus two so for example

3758
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:48,960
plus two so for example
 

3759
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:51,110
plus two so for example
chat let's say that chad rolling his

3760
01:19:51,110 --> 01:19:51,120
chat let's say that chad rolling his
 

3761
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:52,870
chat let's say that chad rolling his
1d10 gets an eight

3762
01:19:52,870 --> 01:19:52,880
1d10 gets an eight
 

3763
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:56,390
1d10 gets an eight
eight plus two is ten

3764
01:19:56,390 --> 01:19:56,400

 

3765
01:19:56,400 --> 01:20:04,870

so chad's initiative mod is ten

3766
01:20:04,870 --> 01:20:04,880
so chad's initiative mod is ten
 

3767
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:07,590
so chad's initiative mod is ten
it's ten but let's say another player

3768
01:20:07,590 --> 01:20:07,600
it's ten but let's say another player
 

3769
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:09,510
it's ten but let's say another player
rolls a one d10

3770
01:20:09,510 --> 01:20:09,520

have the
 

3865
01:21:57,199 --> 01:22:00,470
have the
the appropriate merit um so or they just

3866
01:22:00,470 --> 01:22:00,480
the appropriate merit um so or they just
 

3867
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:01,750
the appropriate merit um so or they just
do certain things they can also be

3868
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:01,760
do certain things they can also be
 

3869
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:03,669
do certain things they can also be
reflexive they don't always add

3870
01:22:03,669 --> 01:22:03,679
reflexive they don't always add
 

3871

reflexive they don't always add
dice to your role um they might just

3872
01:22:06,310 --> 01:22:06,320
dice to your role um they might just
 

3873
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:08,070
dice to your role um they might just
help you be able to even do something in

3874
01:22:08,070 --> 01:22:08,080
help you be able to even do something in
 

3875
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:09,030
help you be able to even do something in
the first place

3876
01:22:09,030 --> 01:22:09,040
the first place
 

3877
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:11,910
the first place
for example ambidextrous under physical

3878
01:22:11,910 --> 01:22:11,920
for example ambidextrous under physical
 

3879
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:12,709
for example ambidextrous under physical
merits

3880
01:22:12,709 --> 01:22:12,719
merits
 

3881
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:14,709
merits
character creation only ignore offhand

3882
01:22:14,709 --> 01:22:14,719
character creation only ignore offhand
 

3883
01:22:14,719 --> 01:22:16,310
character creation only ignore offhand
penalties so

3884
01:22:16,310 --> 01:22:16,320
penalties so
 

3885
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:19,430
penalties so
if you're using your um i guess both of

3886
01:22:19,430 --> 01:22:19,440
if you're using your um i guess both of
 

3887
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:20,790
if you're using your um i guess both of
your hands are dominant

3888
01:22:20,790 --> 01:22:20,800
your hands are dominant
 

3889
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:22,870
your hands are dominant
so you could be dual wielding weapons

3890
01:22:22,870 --> 01:22:22,880
so you could be dual wielding weapons
 

3891
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:24,070
so you could be dual wielding weapons
and you won't take a penalty

3892
01:22:24,070 --> 01:22:24,080
and you won't take a penalty
 

3893
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:26,790
and you won't take a penalty
to use a weapon in for example your

3894
01:22:26,790 --> 01:22:26,800
to use a weapon in for example your
 

3895
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:28,310
to use a weapon in for example your
non-dominant hand because you're

3896
01:22:28,310 --> 01:22:28,320
non-dominant hand because you're
 

3897
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:33,430
non-dominant hand because you're
ambidextrous

3898
01:22:33,430 --> 01:22:33,440

 

3899
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:35,430

yeah but you're gonna need to it's gonna

3900
01:22:35,430 --> 01:22:35,440
yeah but you're gonna need to it's gonna
 

3901
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:37,189
yeah but you're gonna need to it's gonna
need to be three points

3902
01:22:37,189 --> 01:22:37,199
need to be three points
 

3903
01:22:37,199 --> 01:22:39,590
need to be three points
so for merits how many points do you get

3904
01:22:39,590 --> 01:22:39,600
so for merits how many points do you get
 

3905
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,030
so for merits how many points do you get
let's find out

3906
01:22:41,030 --> 01:22:41,040
let's find out
 

3907

by each of the merits so ambidextrous

3922
01:23:00,310 --> 01:23:00,320
by each of the merits so ambidextrous
 

3923
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:02,629
by each of the merits so ambidextrous
takes three dots

3924
01:23:02,629 --> 01:23:02,639
takes three dots
 

3925
01:23:02,639 --> 01:23:05,030
takes three dots
okay so i can add them up until i have

3926
01:23:05,030 --> 01:23:05,040
okay so i can add them up until i have
 

3927

okay so i can add them up until i have
seven points there

3928
01:23:06,229 --> 01:23:06,239
seven points there
 

3929
01:23:06,239 --> 01:23:10,870
seven points there
exactly okay how about the prerequisites

um here let me see
what's the good iron stamina round and

3946
01:23:27,030 --> 01:23:27,040
what's the good iron stamina round and
 

3947
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:28,709
what's the good iron stamina round and
pound the ground

that's good that's good
 

3955
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:43,590
that's good that's good
let's see so for example the the

3956
01:23:43,590 --> 01:23:43,600
let's see so for example the the
 

3957
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:44,629
let's see so for example the the
physical merit

3958
01:23:44,629 --> 01:23:44,639
physical merit
 

3959
01:23:44,639 --> 01:23:48,229
physical merit
relentless it only costs uh one dot

3960
01:23:48,229 --> 01:23:48,239
relentless it only costs uh one dot
 

3961
01:23:48,239 --> 01:23:50,310
relentless it only costs uh one dot
and what it will do for you is it adds

3962
01:23:50,310 --> 01:23:50,320
and what it will do for you is it adds
 

3963
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:52,550
and what it will do for you is it adds
two to the successes needed against you

3964
01:23:52,550 --> 01:23:52,560
two to the successes needed against you
 

3965
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:53,510
two to the successes needed against you
in a chase

3966
01:23:53,510 --> 01:23:53,520
in a chase
 

3967
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:55,110
in a chase
so say for example you're chasing

3968
01:23:55,110 --> 01:23:55,120
so say for example you're chasing
 

3969
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:57,030
so say for example you're chasing
someone down and they're rolling to get

3970
01:23:57,030 --> 01:23:57,040
someone down and they're rolling to get
 

3971
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:58,310
someone down and they're rolling to get
away from you

3972
01:23:58,310 --> 01:23:58,320
away from you
 

3973
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:00,709
away from you
they need two more successes than would

3974
01:24:00,709 --> 01:24:00,719
they need two more successes than would
 

3975
01:24:00,719 --> 01:24:03,270
they need two more successes than would
normally be required

3976
01:24:03,270 --> 01:24:03,280
normally be required
 

3977
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:05,350
normally be required
because you have that relentless merit

3978
01:24:05,350 --> 01:24:05,360
because you have that relentless merit
 

3979
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:06,470
because you have that relentless merit
however

3980
01:24:06,470 --> 01:24:06,480
however
 

3981
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:08,390
however
in order to get that merit you need to

3982
01:24:08,390 --> 01:24:08,400
in order to get that merit you need to
 

3983
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:10,310
in order to get that merit you need to
have two dots in athletics

3984
01:24:10,310 --> 01:24:10,320
have two dots in athletics
 

3985
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:16,070
have two dots in athletics
and three dots in stamina i see

3986
01:24:16,070 --> 01:24:16,080
and three dots in stamina i see
 

3987
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:18,390
and three dots in stamina i see
oh man yeah so this is the big brain

3988
01:24:18,390 --> 01:24:18,400
oh man yeah so this is the big brain
 

3989
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:19,669
oh man yeah so this is the big brain
part this is going to take a little bit

3990
01:24:19,669 --> 01:24:19,679
part this is going to take a little bit
 

3991
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:20,550
part this is going to take a little bit
longer even though

3992
01:24:20,550 --> 01:24:20,560
longer even though
 

3993
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:22,870
longer even though
it's less dots than the others you might

3994
01:24:22,870 --> 01:24:22,880
it's less dots than the others you might
 

3995
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:24,149
it's less dots than the others you might
want to think a little harder about this

3996
01:24:24,149 --> 01:24:24,159
want to think a little harder about this
 

3997
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:25,990
want to think a little harder about this
one i'm going to make chad ambidextrous

so i'm gonna do that for him actually
 

4339
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:23,750
so i'm gonna do that for him actually
area of expertise it only costs one dot

4340
01:31:23,750 --> 01:31:23,760
area of expertise it only costs one dot
 

4341
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:27,990
area of expertise it only costs one dot
oh but it needs a resolve

4342

one more time so drive has a special
 

4393
01:32:39,679 --> 01:32:41,350
one more time so drive has a special
skill on the list that you sent

4394
01:32:41,350 --> 01:32:41,360
skill on the list that you sent
 

4395
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:44,709
skill on the list that you sent
also called flying right does it have to

4396
01:32:44,709 --> 01:32:44,719
also called flying right does it have to

01:32:44,719 --> 01:32:46,390
also called flying right does it have to
be your special skill or can drive

4398

also just automatically mean flying

4400
01:32:50,629 --> 01:32:50,639
also just automatically mean flying
 

4401
01:32:50,639 --> 01:32:53,350
also just automatically mean flying
ah that's a good question um i mean if

4402
01:32:53,350 --> 01:32:53,360
ah that's a good question um i mean if
 

4403
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:55,110
ah that's a good question um i mean if
you are rolling to like fly a plane or

4404
01:32:55,110 --> 01:32:55,120
you are rolling to like fly a plane or
 

4405
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:56,070
you are rolling to like fly a plane or
something like that

4406
01:32:56,070 --> 01:32:56,080
something like that
 

4407
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:59,030
something like that
then i would have you roll drive and

4408
01:32:59,030 --> 01:32:59,040
then i would have you roll drive and
 

4409
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:00,149
then i would have you roll drive and
probably dexterity

4410
01:33:00,149 --> 01:33:00,159
probably dexterity
 

4411
01:33:00,159 --> 01:33:02,629
probably dexterity
as well and if it was a plane you'd be

4412
01:33:02,629 --> 01:33:02,639
as well and if it was a plane you'd be
 

4413
01:33:02,639 --> 01:33:04,550
as well and if it was a plane you'd be
able to use that flying specialty to add

4414
01:33:04,550 --> 01:33:04,560
able to use that flying specialty to add
 

4415
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:06,870
able to use that flying specialty to add
one dice to your roll

4416

one dice to your roll
okay and my next question is does it

4418
01:33:08,390 --> 01:33:08,400
okay and my next question is does it
 

4419

what
but hey three points to put into merits

4686
01:38:14,830 --> 01:38:14,840

 

4687
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:20,229

so

4688
01:38:20,229 --> 01:38:20,239

 

4689
01:38:20,239 --> 01:38:22,470

with merits you can only pick can you

4690
01:38:22,470 --> 01:38:22,480
with merits you can only pick can you
 

4691
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:24,629
with merits you can only pick can you
pick like seven and put one in each or

4692
01:38:24,629 --> 01:38:24,639
pick like seven and put one in each or
 

4693
01:38:24,639 --> 01:38:28,070
pick like seven and put one in each or
if sure was like applicable um i mean if

4694
01:38:28,070 --> 01:38:28,080
if sure was like applicable um i mean if
 

4695
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:30,070
if sure was like applicable um i mean if
you picked seven merits that all cost

4696
01:38:30,070 --> 01:38:30,080
you picked seven merits that all cost
 

4697
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:31,109
you picked seven merits that all cost
one dot yeah

4698
01:38:31,109 --> 01:38:31,119
one dot yeah

yeah okay okay yeah
 

4701
01:38:44,639 --> 01:38:46,310
yeah okay okay yeah
so that's the point value which adds to

4702
01:38:46,310 --> 01:38:46,320
so that's the point value which adds to
 

4703
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:48,310
so that's the point value which adds to
the amount of freebie points

4704
01:38:48,310 --> 01:38:48,320
the amount of freebie points
 

4705
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:54,870
the amount of freebie points
during creation process

4706
01:38:54,870 --> 01:38:54,880

so let's see for now um i guess just
i feel like the best way to go about it

4744

i feel like the best way to go about it
 

4745
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:44,310
i feel like the best way to go about it
is to pick flaws that just go with your

4746
01:39:44,310 --> 01:39:44,320
is to pick flaws that just go with your

but that should be
 

4755
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:56,870
but that should be
okay for now all right

all-around

6396
02:18:17,349 --> 02:18:17,359
all-around
 

6397
02:18:17,359 --> 02:18:19,589
all-around
you know kind of a wild card you know

6398
02:18:19,589 --> 02:18:19,599

yeah yeah
i can imagine that i can see that

6402
02:18:22,830 --> 02:18:22,840
i can imagine that i can see that
 

6403
02:18:22,840 --> 02:18:24,230
i can imagine that i can see that
happening

6404
02:18:24,230 --> 02:18:24,240
happening
 

6405
02:18:24,240 --> 02:18:27,830
happening
i like it i like it all right

6406
02:18:27,830 --> 02:18:27,840
i like it i like it all right
 

6407
02:18:27,840 --> 02:18:31,349
i like it i like it all right
so let's see um hold on wonder if we

6408
02:18:31,349 --> 02:18:31,359
so let's see um hold on wonder if we
 

6409
02:18:31,359 --> 02:18:33,190
so let's see um hold on wonder if we
should do this today

6410
02:18:33,190 --> 02:18:33,200
should do this today
 

6411
02:18:33,200 --> 02:18:36,629
should do this today
um i wanted to do like a little test rp

6412
02:18:36,629 --> 02:18:36,639
um i wanted to do like a little test rp
 

6413
02:18:36,639 --> 02:18:38,389
um i wanted to do like a little test rp
but i'm starting to think we really

6414
02:18:38,389 --> 02:18:38,399
but i'm starting to think we really
 

6415
02:18:38,399 --> 02:18:40,070
but i'm starting to think we really
should wait to get the okay for this

6416
02:18:40,070 --> 02:18:40,080
should wait to get the okay for this
 

6417
02:18:40,080 --> 02:18:41,589
should wait to get the okay for this
rolling dice but i think that you guys

6418
02:18:41,589 --> 02:18:41,599
rolling dice but i think that you guys
 

6419
02:18:41,599 --> 02:18:42,309
rolling dice but i think that you guys
understand

6420
02:18:42,309 --> 02:18:42,319
understand
 

6421
02:18:42,319 --> 02:18:46,230
understand
how the the dice add up um

6422
02:18:46,230 --> 02:18:46,240
how the the dice add up um
 

6423
02:18:46,240 --> 02:18:49,349
how the the dice add up um
so for example let's say let's say

6424
02:18:49,349 --> 02:18:49,359
so for example let's say let's say
 

6425
02:18:49,359 --> 02:18:52,870
so for example let's say let's say
um for example uh yule

6426
02:18:52,870 --> 02:18:52,880
um for example uh yule
 

6427
02:18:52,880 --> 02:18:56,070
um for example uh yule
wants to roll um to

6428
02:18:56,070 --> 02:18:56,080
wants to roll um to
 

6429
02:18:56,080 --> 02:18:59,910
wants to roll um to
let's see craft something right

6430
02:18:59,910 --> 02:18:59,920
let's see craft something right
 

6431
02:18:59,920 --> 02:19:02,629
let's see craft something right
um let's see let's say that yo wants to

6432
02:19:02,629 --> 02:19:02,639
um let's see let's say that yo wants to
 

6433
02:19:02,639 --> 02:19:04,549
um let's see let's say that yo wants to
roll to craft something in the moment

6434
02:19:04,549 --> 02:19:04,559
roll to craft something in the moment
 

6435
02:19:04,559 --> 02:19:05,910
roll to craft something in the moment
it's kind of like a spur the moment

6436
02:19:05,910 --> 02:19:05,920
it's kind of like a spur the moment
 

6437
02:19:05,920 --> 02:19:06,549
it's kind of like a spur the moment
thing

6438
02:19:06,549 --> 02:19:06,559
thing
 

6439
02:19:06,559 --> 02:19:09,589
thing
so you would use um your wits

6440
02:19:09,589 --> 02:19:09,599
so you would use um your wits
 

6441
02:19:09,599 --> 02:19:11,990
so you would use um your wits
plus your crafts and then add your

6442
02:19:11,990 --> 02:19:12,000
plus your crafts and then add your
 

6443
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:13,830
plus your crafts and then add your
crafter scent specialty

6444
02:19:13,830 --> 02:19:13,840
crafter scent specialty
 

6445
02:19:13,840 --> 02:19:16,870
crafter scent specialty
so you have three wits four crafts

6446
02:19:16,870 --> 02:19:16,880
so you have three wits four crafts
 

6447
02:19:16,880 --> 02:19:19,429
so you have three wits four crafts
uh four for crafts and then one for

6448
02:19:19,429 --> 02:19:19,439
uh four for crafts and then one for
 

6449
02:19:19,439 --> 02:19:20,549
uh four for crafts and then one for
crafters since that's

6450
02:19:20,549 --> 02:19:20,559
crafters since that's
 

6451
02:19:20,559 --> 02:19:23,030
crafters since that's
four plus three four five three seven

6452
02:19:23,030 --> 02:19:23,040
four plus three four five three seven
 

6453
02:19:23,040 --> 02:19:24,709
four plus three four five three seven
eight eight dice total

6454
02:19:24,709 --> 02:19:24,719
eight eight dice total
 

6455
02:19:24,719 --> 02:19:28,150
eight eight dice total
ah yeah your dice pool is gonna be eight

6456
02:19:28,150 --> 02:19:28,160
ah yeah your dice pool is gonna be eight
 

6457
02:19:28,160 --> 02:19:31,990
ah yeah your dice pool is gonna be eight
and then you'll roll those dice um and

6458
02:19:31,990 --> 02:19:32,000
and then you'll roll those dice um and
 

6459
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:33,349
and then you'll roll those dice um and
basically the way that it works is you

6460
02:19:33,349 --> 02:19:33,359
basically the way that it works is you
 

6461
02:19:33,359 --> 02:19:35,190
basically the way that it works is you
want to get successes

6462
02:19:35,190 --> 02:19:35,200
want to get successes
 

6463
02:19:35,200 --> 02:19:37,910
want to get successes
um a success on your dice is either an

6464
02:19:37,910 --> 02:19:37,920
um a success on your dice is either an
 

6465
02:19:37,920 --> 02:19:38,309
um a success on your dice is either an
eight

6466
02:19:38,309 --> 02:19:38,319
eight
 

6467
02:19:38,319 --> 02:19:41,429
eight
a nine or a ten oh

6468
02:19:41,429 --> 02:19:41,439
a nine or a ten oh
 

6469
02:19:41,439 --> 02:19:45,030
a nine or a ten oh
and tens you re-roll

6470
02:19:45,030 --> 02:19:45,040

 

6471
02:19:45,040 --> 02:19:48,710

so you can get more successes

6472
02:19:48,710 --> 02:19:48,720
so you can get more successes
 

6473
02:19:48,720 --> 02:19:50,230
so you can get more successes
and basically the amount of successes

6474
02:19:50,230 --> 02:19:50,240
and basically the amount of successes
 

6475
02:19:50,240 --> 02:19:52,389
and basically the amount of successes
that you get will pretty much determine

6476
02:19:52,389 --> 02:19:52,399
that you get will pretty much determine
 

6477
02:19:52,399 --> 02:19:52,710
that you get will pretty much determine
how

6478
02:19:52,710 --> 02:19:52,720
how
 

6479
02:19:52,720 --> 02:19:55,190
how
the action is carried out whether you

6480
02:19:55,190 --> 02:19:55,200
the action is carried out whether you
 

6481
02:19:55,200 --> 02:19:56,710
the action is carried out whether you
succeed or not

6482
02:19:56,710 --> 02:19:56,720
succeed or not
 

6483
02:19:56,720 --> 02:19:58,630
succeed or not
um so you want to basically increase

6484
02:19:58,630 --> 02:19:58,640
um so you want to basically increase
 

6485
02:19:58,640 --> 02:20:00,870
um so you want to basically increase
your chance of getting successes by

6486
02:20:00,870 --> 02:20:00,880
your chance of getting successes by
 

6487
02:20:00,880 --> 02:20:01,990
your chance of getting successes by
having a heightened dice

6488
02:20:01,990 --> 02:20:02,000
having a heightened dice
 

6489
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:06,150
having a heightened dice
pool yeah

6490
02:20:06,150 --> 02:20:06,160

 

6491
02:20:06,160 --> 02:20:07,670

and each of you guys will make your

6492
02:20:07,670 --> 02:20:07,680
and each of you guys will make your
 

6493
02:20:07,680 --> 02:20:09,510
and each of you guys will make your
