idea like what one idea I read is that

3438
01:39:52,550 --> 01:39:52,560
idea like what one idea I read is that
 

3439
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:56,870
idea like what one idea I read is that
maybe I should like do a few less uh

3440
01:39:56,870 --> 01:39:56,880
maybe I should like do a few less uh
 

3441
01:39:56,880 --> 01:39:58,229
maybe I should like do a few less uh
criterias even though I think my

3442
01:39:58,229 --> 01:39:58,239
criterias even though I think my
 

3443
01:39:58,239 --> 01:40:00,790
criterias even though I think my
criterias were

3444
01:40:00,790 --> 01:40:00,800
criterias were
 

3445
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:04,350
criterias were
funny um so I might like ditch

3446
01:40:04,350 --> 01:40:04,360
funny um so I might like ditch
 

3447
01:40:04,360 --> 01:40:08,229
funny um so I might like ditch
like two or three or even half of them

3448
01:40:08,229 --> 01:40:08,239
like two or three or even half of them
 

3449
01:40:08,239 --> 01:40:10,709
like two or three or even half of them
so that we can go through it

3450
01:40:10,709 --> 01:40:10,719
so that we can go through it
 

3451
01:40:10,719 --> 01:40:13,510
so that we can go through it
faster yeah I liked it but I want to go

3452
01:40:13,510 --> 01:40:13,520
faster yeah I liked it but I want to go
 

3453
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:16,109
faster yeah I liked it but I want to go
through more but also I don't want to

3454
01:40:16,109 --> 01:40:16,119
through more but also I don't want to
 

3455
01:40:16,119 --> 01:40:17,910
through more but also I don't want to
like speed through them I think it's

3456
01:40:17,910 --> 01:40:17,920
like speed through them I think it's
 

3457
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:22,030
like speed through them I think it's
nice like the the pacing that we had

3458
01:40:22,030 --> 01:40:22,040
nice like the the pacing that we had
 

3459
01:40:22,040 --> 01:40:24,669
nice like the the pacing that we had
until the end where we were going really

3460
01:40:24,669 --> 01:40:24,679
until the end where we were going really
 

3461
01:40:24,679 --> 01:40:27,910
until the end where we were going really
fast I think in theory was fine I just

3462
01:40:27,910 --> 01:40:27,920
fast I think in theory was fine I just
 

3463
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:31,390
fast I think in theory was fine I just
felt like obligated to check as many as

3464
01:40:31,390 --> 01:40:31,400
felt like obligated to check as many as
 

3465
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:33,629
felt like obligated to check as many as
possible that's why it took so long but

3466
01:40:33,629 --> 01:40:33,639
possible that's why it took so long but
 

3467
01:40:33,639 --> 01:40:35,070
possible that's why it took so long but
generally I don't want these streams to

3468
01:40:35,070 --> 01:40:35,080
generally I don't want these streams to
 

3469
01:40:35,080 --> 01:40:38,510
generally I don't want these streams to
be that long

3470
01:40:38,510 --> 01:40:38,520

 

3471
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:41,990

either I'll think about it can I delete

3472
01:40:41,990 --> 01:40:42,000
either I'll think about it can I delete
 

3473
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,310

3476
01:40:45,750 --> 01:40:45,760
but it's going to be a little bit
 

3477
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:48,149
but it's going to be a little bit
difficult for me I guess to find the

3478
01:40:48,149 --> 01:40:48,159
difficult for me I guess to find the
 

3479
01:40:48,159 --> 01:40:49,430
difficult for me I guess to find the
ones I

3480
01:40:49,430 --> 01:40:49,440
ones I
 

3481
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:51,550
