Nothing's gonna happen if you wait

3
00:00:15,001 --> 00:00:17,023
Do you all like thrills?

4
00:00:17,024 --> 00:00:19,024
Aren't you get bored with life?

5
00:00:20,013 --> 00:00:22,283
Even I’m excited about falling

00:00:22,284 --> 00:00:24,597
That figure is aesthetics

7
00:00:24,598 --> 00:00:26,836
Would you rather choose a life of

8
00:00:26,837 --> 00:00:28,837
Peaceful or Stormy

9
00:00:38,363 --> 00:00:39,067
Ahaha!

10
00:00:39,068 --> 00:00:43,412
There are times in life when you fall

11
00:00:43,413 --> 00:00:44,149
But

12
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:48,429
if you never fall, you won’t climb

13
00:00:48,974 --> 00:00:53,449
You’ve said it’s like an attraction

14
00:00:53,449 --> 00:00:57,059
Don’t be afraid to fall

15
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,455
Gonna dive in!

The straight and narrow path is not enough

19
00:01:03,356 --> 00:01:05,583
These words will make you the strongest

20
00:01:05,584 --> 00:01:06,601
Chant it in your heart

21
00:01:06,602 --> 00:01:07,781
That’s the magical word

22
00:01:07,782 --> 00:01:08,583
“HENTAI”

23
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:20,324
There are many kinds of tears

24
00:01:20,325 --> 00:01:22,800
Painful or Pleasant

25
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:24,909
I think I’m going crazy

26
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:26,910
Isn’t it happier?

27
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:30,000
There’s sometimes we’re hopeless

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,497
You can't climb without descending

29
00:01:32,497 --> 00:01:34,497
If you're scared of falling

30
00:01:34,498 --> 00:01:36,498
There’s no up

31
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:40,724
No way I know my future

32
00:01:41,921 --> 00:01:46,276
That’s why focus on my feeling

33
00:01:46,277 --> 00:01:51,129
I’m the best idol in the world

''HENTAI''

37
00:01:56,557 --> 00:01:58,784
When we cross the red light, that’s tight

38
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,293
No matter how ashamed we’re, it’s alright

39
00:02:01,294 --> 00:02:03,108

I see that you’re horny

41
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:08,028
Then I will be sexy and lose my mind

00:02:08,029 --> 00:02:10,915
Oh no! I Can’t stop my heart beating…

43
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:13,326
