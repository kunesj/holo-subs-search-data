05:39:32,628 --> 05:39:32,638
more
 

11983
05:39:32,638 --> 05:39:34,948
more
manageable

11984
05:39:34,948 --> 05:39:34,958
manageable
 

11985
05:39:34,958 --> 05:39:37,590
manageable
but again here we have the the risk that

11986
05:39:37,590 --> 05:39:37,600
but again here we have the the risk that
 

11987
05:39:37,600 --> 05:39:39,510
but again here we have the the risk that
let's say i do that and i use a lot of

11988
05:39:39,510 --> 05:39:39,520
let's say i do that and i use a lot of

berries
and then right before the end i fail

11994
05:39:46,948 --> 05:39:46,958
and then right before the end i fail
 

11995
05:39:46,958 --> 05:39:48,868
and then right before the end i fail

and then i have no more berries left to
do it again

guess maybe

12060
05:41:35,190 --> 05:41:35,200
guess maybe
 

12061
05:41:35,200 --> 05:41:36,868
guess maybe
but

12062
05:41:36,868 --> 05:41:36,878
but
 

12063
05:41:36,878 --> 05:41:38,628
but
is that really the strength what would

12064
05:41:38,628 --> 05:41:38,638
is that really the strength what would
 

12065
05:41:38,638 --> 05:41:40,708
is that really the strength what would
the strategy be with dynamite besides

12066
05:41:40,708 --> 05:41:40,718
the strategy be with dynamite besides
 

12067
05:41:40,718 --> 05:41:43,830
the strategy be with dynamite besides
using dynamite

12068

12069
05:41:43,840 --> 05:41:46,390

because then i i could then uh try to

12070
05:41:46,390 --> 05:41:46,400
because then i i could then uh try to
 

12071
05:41:46,400 --> 05:41:47,510
because then i i could then uh try to
combine

12072
05:41:47,510 --> 05:41:47,520
combine
 

12073
05:41:47,520 --> 05:41:51,270

13905
06:30:24,000 --> 06:30:27,110

they all attempted to end this

13906
06:30:27,110 --> 06:30:27,120
they all attempted to end this
 

13907
06:30:27,120 --> 06:30:29,240

06:30:33,430 --> 06:30:33,440
but no one was able to do it
 

13913
06:30:33,440 --> 06:30:34,548
but no one was able to do it
and it's just

13914
06:30:34,548 --> 06:30:34,558
and it's just
 

13915
06:30:34,558 --> 06:30:37,750
and it's just
an endless cycle

13916
06:30:37,750 --> 06:30:37,760
an endless cycle
 

13917
06:30:37,760 --> 06:30:39,750
an endless cycle
but the ironic thing is the thing that

13918
06:30:39,750 --> 06:30:39,760
but the ironic thing is the thing that
 

13919
06:30:39,760 --> 06:30:44,150
but the ironic thing is the thing that
you're fighting there at the end

13920
06:30:44,150 --> 06:30:44,160

 

13921
06:30:44,160 --> 06:30:46,310

13923
06:30:46,320 --> 06:30:50,390
yeah
then what's the fight for if you win it

13924
06:30:50,390 --> 06:30:50,400
then what's the fight for if you win it
 

13925
06:30:50,400 --> 06:30:55,030
then what's the fight for if you win it
and winning it just means you're losing

13926
06:30:55,030 --> 06:30:55,040
and winning it just means you're losing
 

13927
06:30:55,040 --> 06:31:00,788
and winning it just means you're losing
is the fight maybe just my imagination

13928
06:31:00,788 --> 06:31:00,798

 

13929
06:31:00,798 --> 06:31:01,670

the wrong objective that's the word
you thought that that was the way of

you thought that that was the way of
 

13957
06:31:32,400 --> 06:31:33,590
you thought that that was the way of
ending it

13958
06:31:33,590 --> 06:31:33,600
ending it
 

13959
06:31:33,600 --> 06:31:35,590
ending it
but the real way of adding it is

13960
06:31:35,590 --> 06:31:35,600
but the real way of adding it is
 

13961
06:31:35,600 --> 06:31:39,430
but the real way of adding it is
collecting all the pages to one book

13962
06:31:39,430 --> 06:31:39,440
collecting all the pages to one book
 

13963

06:36:58,150 --> 06:36:58,160

 

14215
06:36:58,160 --> 06:37:01,110

hi

14216
06:37:01,110 --> 06:37:01,120

 

14217
06:37:01,120 --> 06:37:03,590

ending because this was just a

14218
06:37:03,590 --> 06:37:03,600
ending because this was just a
 

14219
06:37:03,600 --> 06:37:05,670
ending because this was just a
bad [\h__\h] ending

14220
06:37:05,670 --> 06:37:05,680
bad [\h__\h] ending
 

14221
06:37:05,680 --> 06:37:08,948
bad [\h__\h] ending
but it really motivates you to find the

14222
06:37:08,948 --> 06:37:08,958
but it really motivates you to find the
 

14223
06:37:08,958 --> 06:37:10,548
but it really motivates you to find the
true ending

14224
06:37:10,548 --> 06:37:10,558
true ending
 

14225
06:37:10,558 --> 06:37:13,110
true ending
and i i mean i probably wouldn't be so

14226
06:37:13,110 --> 06:37:13,120
and i i mean i probably wouldn't be so
 

14227
06:37:13,120 --> 06:37:15,430
and i i mean i probably wouldn't be so
motivated if i still had like what 20

14228
06:37:15,430 --> 06:37:15,440
motivated if i still had like what 20
 

14229
06:37:15,440 --> 06:37:17,670
motivated if i still had like what 20
pages to find but how can you possibly

14230
06:37:17,670 --> 06:37:17,680
pages to find but how can you possibly
 

14231
06:37:17,680 --> 06:37:20,230
pages to find but how can you possibly
miss that many pages anyway

14232
06:37:20,230 --> 06:37:20,240
miss that many pages anyway
 

14233
06:37:20,240 --> 06:37:22,548
miss that many pages anyway
yo

14234
06:37:22,548 --> 06:37:22,558

 

14235
06:37:22,558 --> 06:37:25,350

impossible i found a lot of like chests

14236
06:37:25,350 --> 06:37:25,360
impossible i found a lot of like chests
 

14237
06:37:25,360 --> 06:37:26,948
impossible i found a lot of like chests
that are hard to find but i think the

14238
06:37:26,948 --> 06:37:26,958
that are hard to find but i think the
 

14239
06:37:26,958 --> 06:37:29,110
that are hard to find but i think the
pages are

14240
06:37:29,110 --> 06:37:29,120
pages are
 

14241
06:37:29,120 --> 06:37:32,948
pages are
mostly relatively easy to see to catch

14242
06:37:32,948 --> 06:37:32,958
mostly relatively easy to see to catch
 

14243
06:37:32,958 --> 06:37:35,590
mostly relatively easy to see to catch
i would say

14244
06:37:35,590 --> 06:37:35,600
i would say
 

14245
06:37:35,600 --> 06:37:40,230
i would say
um okay so oh

is it this little tiny thing when i was
 

15217
07:01:33,760 --> 07:01:36,070
is it this little tiny thing when i was
scrolling for the pages i was like

15218

scrolling for the pages i was like
 

15219
07:01:36,080 --> 07:01:38,468
scrolling for the pages i was like
no way that this is also a path

15220
07:01:38,468 --> 07:01:38,478
no way that this is also a path
 

15221
07:01:38,478 --> 07:01:41,510
no way that this is also a path
but i guess it is

15222
07:01:41,510 --> 07:01:41,520
but i guess it is
 

15223
07:01:41,520 --> 07:01:44,150
but i guess it is
and that's a weird path

15224
07:01:44,150 --> 07:01:44,160
and that's a weird path
 

15225
07:01:44,160 --> 07:01:45,350
and that's a weird path
uh

15226
07:01:45,350 --> 07:01:45,360

07:15:42,230 --> 07:15:42,240
48 48 48
 

15749
07:15:42,240 --> 07:15:43,830
48 48 48
48 was wrong

15750
07:15:43,830 --> 07:15:43,840
48 was wrong
 

15751
07:15:43,840 --> 07:15:45,670
48 was wrong
should be 18

15752
07:15:45,670 --> 07:15:45,680
should be 18
 

15753
07:15:45,680 --> 07:15:49,830
should be 18
what

15754
07:15:49,830 --> 07:15:49,840

 

15755
07:15:49,840 --> 07:15:51,510

well now i'm working with the screenshot

15756
07:15:51,510 --> 07:15:51,520
well now i'm working with the screenshot
 

15757
07:15:51,520 --> 07:15:52,830
well now i'm working with the screenshot
what do you

15758
07:15:52,830 --> 07:15:52,840
what do you
 

15759
07:15:52,840 --> 07:15:56,948
what do you
mean top left is 48 right

15760
07:15:56,948 --> 07:15:56,958
mean top left is 48 right
 

15761
07:15:56,958 --> 07:15:58,468
mean top left is 48 right
which is here

15762
07:15:58,468 --> 07:15:58,478
which is here
 

15763
07:15:58,478 --> 07:16:00,948
which is here
and then the golden path for 48 is just

15764
07:16:00,948 --> 07:16:00,958
and then the golden path for 48 is just
 

15765
07:16:00,958 --> 07:16:03,350
and then the golden path for 48 is just
this

15766
07:16:03,350 --> 07:16:03,360

 

15767
07:16:03,360 --> 07:16:05,270

i did 18 instead okay

15768
07:16:05,270 --> 07:16:05,280
i did 18 instead okay
 

15769
07:16:05,280 --> 07:16:07,430
i did 18 instead okay
okay okay yeah i don't remember drawing

15770

okay okay yeah i don't remember drawing
 

15771
07:16:07,440 --> 07:16:09,430
okay okay yeah i don't remember drawing
this one in that's right

15772
07:16:09,430 --> 07:16:09,440
this one in that's right
 

15773
07:16:09,440 --> 07:16:11,350
this one in that's right
okay now it makes more sense because now

15774
07:16:11,350 --> 07:16:11,360
okay now it makes more sense because now
 

15775
07:16:11,360 --> 07:16:12,708
okay now it makes more sense because now
it connects okay

15776
07:16:12,708 --> 07:16:12,718
it connects okay
 

15777
07:16:12,718 --> 07:16:14,708
it connects okay
why did i do 18 cause it looked like a

15778
07:16:14,708 --> 07:16:14,718
why did i do 18 cause it looked like a
 

15779
07:16:14,718 --> 07:16:16,788
why did i do 18 cause it looked like a

okay maybe not all the way to the edge

15784
07:16:21,350 --> 07:16:21,360
okay maybe not all the way to the edge
 

15785
07:16:21,360 --> 07:16:26,708
okay maybe not all the way to the edge

okay scribbling scribbling
all right

15886
07:19:07,270 --> 07:19:07,280
all right
 

15887
07:19:07,280 --> 07:19:08,830
all right
up

15888
07:19:08,830 --> 07:19:08,840
up
 

15889
07:19:08,840 --> 07:19:14,548
up
right down right mm-hmm

15890
07:19:14,548 --> 07:19:14,558

 

15891
07:19:14,558 --> 07:19:21,030

um

15892
07:19:21,030 --> 07:19:21,040

 

15893
07:19:21,040 --> 07:19:25,510

50.

15894
07:19:25,510 --> 07:19:25,520

 

15895
07:19:25,520 --> 07:19:28,628

you say it goes all the way up to two

15896
07:19:28,628 --> 07:19:28,638
you say it goes all the way up to two
 

15897
07:19:28,638 --> 07:19:30,230
you say it goes all the way up to two
oh you mean there's two path it doesn't

15898
07:19:30,230 --> 07:19:30,240
oh you mean there's two path it doesn't
 

15899
07:19:30,240 --> 07:19:33,990
oh you mean there's two path it doesn't
it's not like um connected

15900
07:19:33,990 --> 07:19:34,000
it's not like um connected
 

15901
07:19:34,000 --> 07:19:35,750
it's not like um connected
it you would say there's two back two

15902
07:19:35,750 --> 07:19:35,760
it you would say there's two back two
 

15903
07:19:35,760 --> 07:19:50,548
it you would say there's two back two
paths going up to two

15904
07:19:50,548 --> 07:19:50,558

 

15905
07:19:50,558 --> 07:19:51,830

i guess so

15906
07:19:51,830 --> 07:19:51,840
i guess so
 

15907
07:19:51,840 --> 07:19:53,830
i guess so
i thought it was just like you know

15908
07:19:53,830 --> 07:19:53,840
i thought it was just like you know
 

15909
07:19:53,840 --> 07:19:57,270
i thought it was just like you know
okay i'll draw it like that um

15910
07:19:57,270 --> 07:19:57,280
okay i'll draw it like that um
 

15911
07:19:57,280 --> 07:20:00,150
okay i'll draw it like that um
so it does two paths to two and one to

15912
07:20:00,150 --> 07:20:00,160
so it does two paths to two and one to
 

15913
07:20:00,160 --> 07:20:01,910
so it does two paths to two and one to
fifty

15914
07:20:01,910 --> 07:20:01,920
fifty
 

15915
07:20:01,920 --> 07:20:06,150
fifty
right

15916
07:20:06,150 --> 07:20:06,160

 

15917
07:20:06,160 --> 07:20:09,510

top is cut off okay we have two l's oh
