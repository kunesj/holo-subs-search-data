01:47:43,790 --> 01:47:43,800

 

3627
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:49,550

is let's just level

3628
01:47:49,550 --> 01:47:49,560

 

3629
01:47:49,560 --> 01:47:56,030

up almost at level 30

3630
01:47:56,030 --> 01:47:56,040

 

3631
01:47:56,040 --> 01:47:57,910

so then if I'm a higher level then I can

3632
01:47:57,910 --> 01:47:57,920
so then if I'm a higher level then I can
 

3633
01:47:57,920 --> 01:48:01,390
so then if I'm a higher level then I can
do even more special
