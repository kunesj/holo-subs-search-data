2286
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:36,830
looking at me like this, you're crazy. That's
definitely true lol. When you look down, everyone is paying attention to you. It's

hard for people with phobias. It's

2289
01:32:41,950 --> 01:32:41,960
hard for people with phobias. It's
 

2290
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:46,830
hard for people with phobias. It's

2294
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:52,550
been practicing so much.  Yeah, really,
yeah. It's definitely more difficult than just

2295
01:32:52,550 --> 01:32:52,560
yeah. It's definitely more difficult than just
 

2296
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:55,030
yeah. It's definitely more difficult than just
practicing a little bit here. Yeah, it

2297
01:32:55,030 --> 01:33:11,390
practicing a little bit here. Yeah, it
 

2298
01:33:11,390 --> 01:33:11,400

 

2299
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:14,950


2300
01:33:14,950 --> 01:33:14,960

 

2301
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:16,750

was only

2302
01:33:16,750 --> 01:33:16,760
was only
 

2303
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:23,470
was only
for a moment, but it was totally difficult. Where's that leg?

2304
01:33:23,470 --> 01:33:23,480
for a moment, but it was totally difficult. Where's that leg?
 

2305
01:33:23,480 --> 01:33:27,950
for a moment, but it was totally difficult. Where's that leg?

2306
01:33:27,950 --> 01:33:32,680

 

2307
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:32,690

 

2308
01:33:32,690 --> 01:33:43,870

[Laughs] It's

2309
01:33:43,870 --> 01:33:45,629

 

2310
01:33:45,629 --> 01:33:45,639

 

2311
01:33:45,639 --> 01:33:50,550

definitely difficult.  I think it

2312
01:33:50,550 --> 01:33:50,560

 

2313
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:56,830

was last year, or something like that with Birdman.That kind of

2314
01:33:56,830 --> 01:33:59,470
was last year, or something like that with Birdman.That kind of
 

2315
01:33:59,470 --> 01:33:59,480

 

2316
01:33:59,480 --> 01:34:04,510

attention is hard, and it takes a moment of hard work,

2317
01:34:04,510 --> 01:34:04,520
attention is hard, and it takes a moment of hard work,
 

2318
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:09,189
attention is hard, and it takes a moment of hard work,
or rather, a huge defeat is decided in an instant,

2319
01:34:09,189 --> 01:34:15,950
or rather, a huge defeat is decided in an instant,
 

2320
01:34:15,950 --> 01:34:15,960

 

2321
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:24,109

so in a sense, it's 300 seconds, so it's like 5 minutes.Yeah,

2322
01:34:24,109 --> 01:34:24,119

 

2323
01:34:24,119 --> 01:34:27,510


2324
01:34:27,510 --> 01:34:27,520

 

2325
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:32,390

yeah.  I wonder what that was all about. I

2326
01:34:32,390 --> 01:34:35,109
yeah.  I wonder what that was all about. I
 

2327
01:34:35,109 --> 01:34:35,119

 

2328
01:34:35,119 --> 01:34:38,750

think it would be better if Sa-chan cheered me on. Yesterday

2329
01:34:38,750 --> 01:34:38,760
think it would be better if Sa-chan cheered me on. Yesterday
 

2330
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:44,149
think it would be better if Sa-chan cheered me on. Yesterday
at practice, I wonder if he'll come back after all.  I

2331
01:34:44,149 --> 01:34:44,159
at practice, I wonder if he'll come back after all.  I
 

2332
01:34:44,159 --> 01:34:45,030
at practice, I wonder if he'll come back after all.  I

2333
01:34:45,030 --> 01:34:50,470

 

2334
01:34:50,470 --> 01:34:50,480

 

2335
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:53,270


2336
01:34:53,270 --> 01:34:53,280

 

2337
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:57,189

can't even see up here

2338
01:34:57,189 --> 01:34:57,199
can't even see up here
 

2339
01:34:57,199 --> 01:35:03,790
can't even see up here
anymore. How far

2340
01:35:03,790 --> 01:35:03,800
anymore. How far
 

2341
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:13,780
anymore. How far
can Boko-san and Chan go? I have to look up.

2342
01:35:13,780 --> 01:35:13,790

 

2343
01:35:13,790 --> 01:35:19,149

[Laughs] I'll do my

2368
01:36:38,719 --> 01:36:43,149

What is the best thing to do with Neo? Isn't it Nae?

2369
01:36:43,149 --> 01:36:45,109
What is the best thing to do with Neo? Isn't it Nae?

2377
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:10,109

? That's fine. Nene-chan is in the book, but

2378
01:37:10,109 --> 01:37:10,119

 

2379
01:37:10,119 --> 01:37:15,590

there are others.

2380
01:37:15,590 --> 01:37:15,600

2385
01:37:29,560 --> 01:37:33,990

might have to ask for something every time.

2386
01:37:33,990 --> 01:37:34,000
might have to ask for something every time.
 

2387
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:38,030
might have to ask for something every time.
Only those who can go

2391
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:50,189

can do it first and add more later

2392
01:37:50,189 --> 01:37:50,199

 

2393
01:37:50,199 --> 01:37:53,030

2397
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:05,750


2398
01:38:05,750 --> 01:38:18,870

 

2399
01:38:18,870 --> 01:38:29,760

 

2400
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:29,770

 

2401
01:38:29,770 --> 01:38:46,270

[Music] I'm

2402
01:38:46,270 --> 01:38:46,280

 

2403
01:38:46,280 --> 01:38:50,109

sure it's

2404
01:38:50,109 --> 01:38:50,119

 

2405
01:38:50,119 --> 01:38:51,750


2406
01:38:51,750 --> 01:38:51,760

 

2407
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:54,390

a bit off after this.  That

2408
01:38:54,390 --> 01:38:54,400
a bit off after this.  That
 

2409
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:55,910
a bit off after this.  That
may have been the case,

2410
01:38:55,910 --> 01:38:55,920
may have been the case,
 

2411
01:38:55,920 --> 01:39:03,030
may have been the case,
but after the line, there was a voice of sadness, and after that, it

2412
01:39:03,030 --> 01:39:07,790
but after the line, there was a voice of sadness, and after that, it
 

2413
01:39:07,790 --> 01:39:07,800

 

2414
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:14,430

felt like a vernalization trire, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, but I guess it didn't feel like it was the end, so it was surprising,

2415
01:39:14,430 --> 01:39:14,440

 

2416
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:17,830

but

2417
01:39:17,830 --> 01:39:17,840
but
 

2418
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:21,709
but
it certainly happened in one episode.  It's probably

2419
01:39:21,709 --> 01:39:21,719
it certainly happened in one episode.  It's probably
 

2420
01:39:21,719 --> 01:39:24,910
it certainly happened in one episode.  It's probably
only once, right? It's only

2421
01:39:24,910 --> 01:39:24,920
only once, right? It's only
 

2422
01:39:24,920 --> 01:39:29,030
only once, right? It's only
one time, so it's just two of them. I

2423
01:39:29,030 --> 01:39:29,040
one time, so it's just two of them. I
 

2424

the best. It

4281
02:45:38,110 --> 02:45:38,120
the best. It
 

4282

4283
02:45:42,590 --> 02:45:42,600
doesn't really come together. It seems like the regular version won't cut it,
 

4284
02:45:42,600 --> 02:45:45,910
doesn't really come together. It seems like the regular version won't cut it,
so it seems like it's a special edition this time.

4285
02:45:45,910 --> 02:45:45,920
so it seems like it's a special edition this time.

02:45:45,920 --> 02:45:48,790
so it seems like it's a special edition this time.

5117
03:16:39,840 --> 03:16:45,630
too bumpy. There's a
lot of borka on top of everyone. It

5118
03:16:45,630 --> 03:16:45,640
lot of borka on top of everyone. It
 

5119
03:16:45,640 --> 03:16:49,070
lot of borka on top of everyone. It
cheers up the volka bread that has bread.  Is the bread
