um
 

495
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,770
um
because essentially

496
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:51,780
because essentially
 

497
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,010

if you have for example

498
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:54,020
if you have for example

um this is this is that but let's say
 

503
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,169
um this is this is that but let's say
you want to write

00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:03,179
you want to write
 

505
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:05,590
you want to write
for some reason I don't know what that

506
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:05,600
for some reason I don't know what that
 

507
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,810
for some reason I don't know what that
if that has any meaning but let's say we

508
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:08,820
if that has any meaning but let's say we
 

509
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,110
if that has any meaning but let's say we
write

510
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:11,120
write
 

511
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:19,570
write
then you have to fit it all uh

00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:19,580

 

513
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:22,450
