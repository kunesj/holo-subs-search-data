long so I set an alarm for two hours

9180
04:38:23,570 --> 04:38:23,580
long so I set an alarm for two hours
 

9181
04:38:23,580 --> 04:38:25,189
long so I set an alarm for two hours
um to go to bed at midnight and then I

9182
04:38:25,189 --> 04:38:25,199
um to go to bed at midnight and then I
 

9183
04:38:25,199 --> 04:38:26,869
um to go to bed at midnight and then I
set the alarm and like I'm playing and

9184

set the alarm and like I'm playing and
 

9185
04:38:26,879 --> 04:38:28,369
set the alarm and like I'm playing and
it just it goes off immediately why

9186
04:38:28,369 --> 04:38:28,379
it just it goes off immediately why
 

9187
04:38:28,379 --> 04:38:31,670
it just it goes off immediately why
because time just flies by and I don't

9188
04:38:31,670 --> 04:38:31,680
because time just flies by and I don't
 

9189
04:38:31,680 --> 04:38:33,170
because time just flies by and I don't
want to put it down because I'm at a

9190
04:38:33,170 --> 04:38:33,180
want to put it down because I'm at a
 

9191
04:38:33,180 --> 04:38:34,310
want to put it down because I'm at a
good part in the story I'm like okay

9192
04:38:34,310 --> 04:38:34,320
good part in the story I'm like okay
 

9193

good part in the story I'm like okay
another hour

9194
04:38:35,510 --> 04:38:35,520
another hour
 

9195
04:38:35,520 --> 04:38:37,310
another hour
and then before I know it I just stopped

9196
04:38:37,310 --> 04:38:37,320
and then before I know it I just stopped
 

9197
04:38:37,320 --> 04:38:38,631
and then before I know it I just stopped
looking at the clock

9198
04:38:38,631 --> 04:38:38,641
looking at the clock
 

9199
04:38:38,641 --> 04:38:40,429
looking at the clock
I check it like maybe once every three

9200
04:38:40,429 --> 04:38:40,439
I check it like maybe once every three
 

9201
04:38:40,439 --> 04:38:42,529
I check it like maybe once every three
hours and I'm like ah three hours have

9202
04:38:42,529 --> 04:38:42,539
hours and I'm like ah three hours have
 

9203
04:38:42,539 --> 04:38:44,510
hours and I'm like ah three hours have
passed and then it's six a.m and I'm

9204
04:38:44,510 --> 04:38:44,520
passed and then it's six a.m and I'm
 

9205
04:38:44,520 --> 04:38:46,429
passed and then it's six a.m and I'm
like how did this happen to me I made my

9206
04:38:46,429 --> 04:38:46,439
like how did this happen to me I made my
 

9207
04:38:46,439 --> 04:38:47,869
like how did this happen to me I made my
mistakes

9208
04:38:47,869 --> 04:38:47,879
mistakes
 

9209
04:38:47,879 --> 04:38:50,750
mistakes
um I guess I should take some Tylenol

9210
04:38:50,750 --> 04:38:50,760
um I guess I should take some Tylenol
 

9211
04:38:50,760 --> 04:38:52,670
um I guess I should take some Tylenol
and try to go to bed and then I see the

9212
04:38:52,670 --> 04:38:52,680
and try to go to bed and then I see the
 

9213
04:38:52,680 --> 04:38:55,189
and try to go to bed and then I see the
sun rising outside

9214
04:38:55,189 --> 04:38:55,199
sun rising outside
 

9215
04:38:55,199 --> 04:38:56,689
sun rising outside
so my

9216
04:38:56,689 --> 04:38:56,699
so my
 

9217
04:38:56,699 --> 04:38:59,090
so my
my line of thinking

9218
04:38:59,090 --> 04:38:59,100
my line of thinking
 

9219
04:38:59,100 --> 04:39:02,150
my line of thinking
is if you really wanted enough and if

9220
04:39:02,150 --> 04:39:02,160
is if you really wanted enough and if
 

9221
04:39:02,160 --> 04:39:04,551
is if you really wanted enough and if
you try hard enough you should be able

9222
04:39:04,551 --> 04:39:04,561
you try hard enough you should be able
 

9223
04:39:04,561 --> 04:39:05,929
you try hard enough you should be able
to do it

9224
04:39:05,929 --> 04:39:05,939
to do it
 

9225
04:39:05,939 --> 04:39:09,529
to do it
you should be able to

9226
04:39:09,529 --> 04:39:09,539
you should be able to
 

9227
04:39:09,539 --> 04:39:13,429
you should be able to
but you need to do things that are fun

9228
04:39:13,429 --> 04:39:13,439
but you need to do things that are fun
 

9229
04:39:13,439 --> 04:39:14,570
but you need to do things that are fun
right

9230
04:39:14,570 --> 04:39:14,580
right
 

9231
04:39:14,580 --> 04:39:17,631
right

maybe okay
 

9239
04:39:23,459 --> 04:39:25,250
maybe okay
perhaps the way I think about it is this

9240
04:39:25,250 --> 04:39:25,260
perhaps the way I think about it is this
 

9241
04:39:25,260 --> 04:39:27,410
perhaps the way I think about it is this
it would be too easy if I played a chill

9242
04:39:27,410 --> 04:39:27,420
it would be too easy if I played a chill
 

9243
04:39:27,420 --> 04:39:28,490
it would be too easy if I played a chill
game

9244
04:39:28,490 --> 04:39:28,500
game
 

9245
04:39:28,500 --> 04:39:31,070
game
okay we could just pop on Final Fantasy

9246
04:39:31,070 --> 04:39:31,080

16 and
 

9249
04:39:32,699 --> 04:39:35,570
16 and
four hours would fly

9250
04:39:35,570 --> 04:39:35,580
four hours would fly
 

9251
04:39:35,580 --> 04:39:38,690
four hours would fly
absolutely fly

9252
04:39:38,690 --> 04:39:38,700
absolutely fly
 

9253
04:39:38,700 --> 04:39:41,448
absolutely fly
like nothing we could

9254
04:39:41,448 --> 04:39:41,458
like nothing we could
 

9255
04:39:41,458 --> 04:39:44,330
like nothing we could
we could do that however

9256
04:39:44,330 --> 04:39:44,340
we could do that however
 

9257
04:39:44,340 --> 04:39:47,750
we could do that however
that is too easy

9258
04:39:47,750 --> 04:39:47,760

 

9259
04:39:47,760 --> 04:39:49,910

that is too easy and so we are doing

9260
04:39:49,910 --> 04:39:49,920
that is too easy and so we are doing
 

9261
04:39:49,920 --> 04:39:51,590
that is too easy and so we are doing
jumping goes to the babe now I don't

9268
04:39:59,630 --> 04:39:59,640
okay Final Fantasy 16 would be an easy
 

9269
04:39:59,640 --> 04:40:01,850
okay Final Fantasy 16 would be an easy
hours yeah honestly I I start up Final

9270
04:40:01,850 --> 04:40:01,860
hours yeah honestly I I start up Final
 

9271
04:40:01,860 --> 04:40:04,610
hours yeah honestly I I start up Final
Fantasy 16. I look at the clock and like

9272
04:40:04,610 --> 04:40:04,620
Fantasy 16. I look at the clock and like
 

9273
04:40:04,620 --> 04:40:06,830
Fantasy 16. I look at the clock and like
10 hours are gone we haven't done a 10

9274
04:40:06,830 --> 04:40:06,840
10 hours are gone we haven't done a 10
 

9275
04:40:06,840 --> 04:40:08,868
10 hours are gone we haven't done a 10
hour Final Fantasy 16 stream but we

9276
04:40:08,868 --> 04:40:08,878
hour Final Fantasy 16 stream but we
 

9277
04:40:08,878 --> 04:40:11,090
hour Final Fantasy 16 stream but we
could theoretically I bet we could maybe

9278
04:40:11,090 --> 04:40:11,100
could theoretically I bet we could maybe
 

9279
04:40:11,100 --> 04:40:13,430
could theoretically I bet we could maybe
the next one next several ones be just

9280
04:40:13,430 --> 04:40:13,440
the next one next several ones be just
 

9281
04:40:13,440 --> 04:40:15,770
the next one next several ones be just
12 hour streams

9282
04:40:15,770 --> 04:40:15,780
12 hour streams
 

9283
04:40:15,780 --> 04:40:17,868
12 hour streams
just instantly time flies playing that

9284
04:40:17,868 --> 04:40:17,878
just instantly time flies playing that
 

9285
04:40:17,878 --> 04:40:19,910
just instantly time flies playing that
game I don't get it

9286
04:40:19,910 --> 04:40:19,920
game I don't get it
 

9287
04:40:19,920 --> 04:40:21,470
game I don't get it
I don't get it

9288
04:40:21,470 --> 04:40:21,480
I don't get it
 

9289
04:40:21,480 --> 04:40:23,868
I don't get it
so

9290
04:40:23,868 --> 04:40:23,878
so
 

9291
04:40:23,878 --> 04:40:25,610
so
honestly would be easier to play getting

9292
04:40:25,610 --> 04:40:25,620
honestly would be easier to play getting
 

9293
04:40:25,620 --> 04:40:27,890
honestly would be easier to play getting
over it for the golden pop

9294
04:40:27,890 --> 04:40:27,900
over it for the golden pop
 

9295
04:40:27,900 --> 04:40:30,470
over it for the golden pop
I mean I wanted though

9296
04:40:30,470 --> 04:40:30,480
I mean I wanted though
 

9297
04:40:30,480 --> 04:40:32,330
I mean I wanted though
50 times

9298
04:40:32,330 --> 04:40:32,340
50 times
 

9299
04:40:32,340 --> 04:40:33,650
50 times
I don't think I could do that in four

9300
04:40:33,650 --> 04:40:33,660
I don't think I could do that in four
 

9301
04:40:33,660 --> 04:40:34,850
I don't think I could do that in four
hours

9302
04:40:34,850 --> 04:40:34,860
hours
 

9303
04:40:34,860 --> 04:40:36,830
hours
pretend you're Clive jumping up to see

9304
04:40:36,830 --> 04:40:36,840
pretend you're Clive jumping up to see
 

9305
04:40:36,840 --> 04:40:38,090
pretend you're Clive jumping up to see
Jill

9306
04:40:38,090 --> 04:40:38,100
Jill
 

9307
04:40:38,100 --> 04:40:40,130
Jill
now there is an idea

9308
04:40:40,130 --> 04:40:40,140
now there is an idea
 

9309
04:40:40,140 --> 04:40:41,868
now there is an idea
I don't know Final Fantasy does that

9310
04:40:41,868 --> 04:40:41,878
I don't know Final Fantasy does that
 

9311
04:40:41,878 --> 04:40:43,250
I don't know Final Fantasy does that
though

9312
04:40:43,250 --> 04:40:43,260
though
 

9313
04:40:43,260 --> 04:40:45,230
though
especially this time the story and

9314
04:40:45,230 --> 04:40:45,240
especially this time the story and
 

9315
04:40:45,240 --> 04:40:47,868
especially this time the story and
characters are just so engaging

9316
04:40:47,868 --> 04:40:47,878
characters are just so engaging
 

9317
04:40:47,878 --> 04:40:49,610
characters are just so engaging
but don't worry we'll be right back into

9318
04:40:49,610 --> 04:40:49,620
but don't worry we'll be right back into
 

9319
04:40:49,620 --> 04:40:50,990
but don't worry we'll be right back into
it

9320
04:40:50,990 --> 04:40:51,000
it
 

9321
04:40:51,000 --> 04:40:54,170
it
um as for what the next couple streams I

9322
04:40:54,170 --> 04:40:54,180
um as for what the next couple streams I
 

9323
04:40:54,180 --> 04:40:57,708
um as for what the next couple streams I
have it I have planned are

9324
04:40:57,708 --> 04:40:57,718
have it I have planned are
 

9325
04:40:57,718 --> 04:40:58,310
have it I have planned are
um

9326
04:40:58,310 --> 04:40:58,320
um
 

9327
04:40:58,320 --> 04:41:00,708
um
a lot of it I kind of can't really it's

9328
04:41:00,708 --> 04:41:00,718

couple months
 

11099
05:25:00,060 --> 05:25:01,730
