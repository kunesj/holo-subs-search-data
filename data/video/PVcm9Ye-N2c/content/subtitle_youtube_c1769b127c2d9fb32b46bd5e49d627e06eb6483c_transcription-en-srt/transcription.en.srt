he's like hmm are you sure like
 

2677
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:01,010
he's like hmm are you sure like
did you calculate like you know

2684
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:10,380
that's exactly how I did it but then he
 

2685
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:11,810
that's exactly how I did it but then he
did it on his phone and it came out

2686
01:17:11,810 --> 01:17:11,820
did it on his phone and it came out
 

2687
01:17:11,820 --> 01:17:14,990
did it on his phone and it came out
completely differently and I'm like yeah

2688
01:17:14,990 --> 01:17:15,000
completely differently and I'm like yeah
 

2689
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,790
completely differently and I'm like yeah
but like for real that's how I

2690
01:17:16,790 --> 01:17:16,800
but like for real that's how I
 

2691
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:19,490
but like for real that's how I
calculated it or at least I wanted to

2692
01:17:19,490 --> 01:17:19,500
calculated it or at least I wanted to
 

2693
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:22,370
calculated it or at least I wanted to
I was I was thinking that's how I

2694
01:17:22,370 --> 01:17:22,380
I was I was thinking that's how I
 

2695
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:24,410
I was I was thinking that's how I
calculated it

2696
01:17:24,410 --> 01:17:24,420
calculated it
 

2697
01:17:24,420 --> 01:17:26,630

I don't know what I did but then I

2698
01:17:26,630 --> 01:17:26,640
I don't know what I did but then I
 

2699
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:28,370
I don't know what I did but then I
calculated it again and it was like yeah

2700
01:17:28,370 --> 01:17:28,380
calculated it again and it was like yeah
 

2701
01:17:28,380 --> 01:17:31,070
calculated it again and it was like yeah
okay you're right

2702
01:17:31,070 --> 01:17:31,080
okay you're right
 

2703
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:33,110

2704
01:17:33,110 --> 01:17:33,120
for me it came out like
 

2705
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:35,630
for me it came out like
really not worth it eight times as much

2706
01:17:35,630 --> 01:17:35,640
really not worth it eight times as much
 

2707

5611
02:33:55,550 --> 02:33:55,560
I'll get to it but like for now I think
 

5612
02:33:55,560 --> 02:33:57,230
I'll get to it but like for now I think
you know I still have a couple of games

5613
02:33:57,230 --> 02:33:57,240
you know I still have a couple of games
 

5614
02:33:57,240 --> 02:33:59,330
you know I still have a couple of games
you know in my

5615
02:33:59,330 --> 02:33:59,340
you know in my
 

5616
02:33:59,340 --> 02:34:01,309
you know in my
back up

5617
02:34:01,309 --> 02:34:01,319
back up
 

5618
02:34:01,319 --> 02:34:06,590
back up
that I in my list basically

5619
02:34:06,590 --> 02:34:06,600

 

5620
02:34:06,600 --> 02:34:07,730

so

5621
02:34:07,730 --> 02:34:07,740
so
 

5622
02:34:07,740 --> 02:34:10,190
so
once I got really really desperate and

5623
02:34:10,190 --> 02:34:10,200
once I got really really desperate and
 

5624
02:34:10,200 --> 02:34:13,570
once I got really really desperate and
I'm like I don't have any games to play

5625
02:34:13,570 --> 02:34:13,580
I'm like I don't have any games to play
 

5626
02:34:13,580 --> 02:34:20,690
