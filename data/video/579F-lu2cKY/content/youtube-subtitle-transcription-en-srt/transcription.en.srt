now something that looks very difficult
 

931
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,789
now something that looks very difficult
we have a maze

932
00:23:54,789 --> 00:23:54,799
we have a maze
 

933
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,149
we have a maze
with like dots and and two green

934
00:23:58,149 --> 00:23:58,159
with like dots and and two green
 

935
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:59,909
with like dots and and two green
circled

936

squares
 

939
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,750
squares
and one white dot and one red triangle

940
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:03,760
and one white dot and one red triangle
 

941
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,990
and one white dot and one red triangle
that is probably me

942
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:06,000
that is probably me
 

943
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,269
that is probably me
oh

944
00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:07,279
oh
 

945
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,510
oh
i think this one is difficult oh oh

946
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:09,520
i think this one is difficult oh oh
 

947
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,029
i think this one is difficult oh oh
should i tell you where the little green

948
00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:11,039
should i tell you where the little green
 

949
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,590
should i tell you where the little green
circled ones are oh yes where are those

950
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:13,600
circled ones are oh yes where are those
 

951
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,430
circled ones are oh yes where are those
oh wait wait wait wait wait there should

952
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:15,440
oh wait wait wait wait wait there should

be two
 

955
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,230
be two
so you are the triangle and then there

956
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:18,240
so you are the triangle and then there
 

957
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,990
so you are the triangle and then there
should be two like circle thingies on

958
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:20,000
should be two like circle thingies on
 

959
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,310
should be two like circle thingies on
the map right yeah okay can you please

960
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:22,320
the map right yeah okay can you please
 

961

tell me
uh where the circle thingies are

964
00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:26,799
uh where the circle thingies are
 

965
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:27,750
uh where the circle thingies are
uh

966
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:27,760
uh
 

967
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,950

maze with matching must navigate the
 

987
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,430
maze with matching must navigate the
right okay so you are the white light

988
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:51,440
right okay so you are the white light
 

989
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,909
right okay so you are the white light
whereas where is the white light

990
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:53,919
whereas where is the white light
 

991
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,430
whereas where is the white light
that one is and on the very very left

992
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:57,440
that one is and on the very very left
 

993
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,830
that one is and on the very very left
side uh from top to bottom third row top

994
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:01,840
side uh from top to bottom third row top
 

995
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,310
side uh from top to bottom third row top
to bottom third height okay and we're

996
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:04,320
to bottom third height okay and we're
 

997
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,950
to bottom third height okay and we're
trying on the very left the triangle is

998
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:06,960
trying on the very left the triangle is
 

999
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,830
trying on the very left the triangle is
in the same row so

1000
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:09,840
in the same row so
 

1001
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,269
in the same row so
top to bottom third row but it's uh

1002
