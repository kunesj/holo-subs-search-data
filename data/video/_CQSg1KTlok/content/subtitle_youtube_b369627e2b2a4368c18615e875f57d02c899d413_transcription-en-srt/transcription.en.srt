538
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:30,760
maybe
 

539
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:35,029
maybe
one or two a lot how much you want

540
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:35,039

one or two a lot how much you want
vanilla

542
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:37,120
vanilla
 

543
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,470
vanilla
sugar a pinch of salt and there's a lot

544
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:40,480
sugar a pinch of salt and there's a lot
 

545
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,270
sugar a pinch of salt and there's a lot
of recipes that have like different

546
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:42,280
of recipes that have like different
 

547
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,909
of recipes that have like different
amounts so it's like whatever you don't

548
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:43,919
amounts so it's like whatever you don't
 

549
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,070
amounts so it's like whatever you don't
even have to do cinnamon or vanilla

550
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:46,080
even have to do cinnamon or vanilla
 

551
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,390
even have to do cinnamon or vanilla
sugar but if you have it you should put

552
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:47,400
sugar but if you have it you should put
 

553
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,149
sugar but if you have it you should put
it in cuz it's makes it

554
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:50,159
it in cuz it's makes it
 

555
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,190
it in cuz it's makes it
better and then you mix it and then you

556
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:54,200
better and then you mix it and then you
 

557
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:59,470
better and then you mix it and then you
pour it for example I just use like uh a

558
00:20:59,470 --> 00:20:59,480
pour it for example I just use like uh a
 

559
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,710
pour it for example I just use like uh a
a high plate like a like a soupy plate

560
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:03,720
a high plate like a like a soupy plate
 

561
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,870
a high plate like a like a soupy plate
and and you pour the mixture in there

562
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:05,880
and and you pour the mixture in there
 

563
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,950
and and you pour the mixture in there
and then you put the the toast on in

564
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:08,960
and then you put the the toast on in
 

565
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,310
and then you put the the toast on in
there or the other way around put the

566
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:10,320
there or the other way around put the
 

567
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,029
there or the other way around put the
toast first and then pour the mixture

568
00:21:12,029 --> 00:21:12,039
toast first and then pour the mixture
 

569
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:13,510
toast first and then pour the mixture
over it and then it should soak it up

570
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:13,520
over it and then it should soak it up
 

571
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,510
over it and then it should soak it up
and ideally you uh let it soak in the

572
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:16,520
and ideally you uh let it soak in the
 

573
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,669
and ideally you uh let it soak in the
fridge for maybe half an hour or so can

574
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:19,679
fridge for maybe half an hour or so can
 

575
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:24,470
fridge for maybe half an hour or so can
be less too if you're not patient enough

576
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:24,480
be less too if you're not patient enough
 

577
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,710
be less too if you're not patient enough
M yeah yeah no don't soak fresh toast

578
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:27,720
M yeah yeah no don't soak fresh toast
 

579
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,549
M yeah yeah no don't soak fresh toast
spread unless you toasted it you should

580
00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:29,559
spread unless you toasted it you should
 

581
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:31,909
spread unless you toasted it you should
toast it first otherwise it's already

582
00:21:31,909 --> 00:21:31,919
toast it first otherwise it's already
 

583
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,990
toast it first otherwise it's already
like too soft it will soak it up better

584
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:35,000
like too soft it will soak it up better
 

585
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,190
like too soft it will soak it up better
if it's like stiff

586
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:38,200
if it's like stiff
 

587
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,149
if it's like stiff
bread you have to let it sit uh I've

588
00:21:41,149 --> 00:21:41,159
bread you have to let it sit uh I've
 

589
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:43,029
bread you have to let it sit uh I've
I've seen it recommended in recipes and

590
00:21:43,029 --> 00:21:43,039
I've seen it recommended in recipes and
 

591
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,269
I've seen it recommended in recipes and
I think that's good because it

592
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:44,279
I think that's good because it
 

593
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:46,510
I think that's good because it
definitely soaks up more of the mixture

594
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:46,520
definitely soaks up more of the mixture
 

595
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,549
definitely soaks up more of the mixture
if you let it sit for a

596
00:21:49,549 --> 00:21:49,559
if you let it sit for a
 

597
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:52,909
if you let it sit for a
while yeah yeah yeah yeah so I put it in

598
00:21:52,909 --> 00:21:52,919
while yeah yeah yeah yeah so I put it in
 

599
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:55,350
while yeah yeah yeah yeah so I put it in
the fridge for like half an hour while

it yeah takes a lot uh uh enough time

608
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:06,480
it yeah takes a lot uh uh enough time
 

609
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,870
it yeah takes a lot uh uh enough time
you've been making it up optimally yeah

610
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:08,880
you've been making it up optimally yeah

happen even if there's no weapons on the

1892
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:04,680
happen even if there's no weapons on the
 

1893
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:06,069
happen even if there's no weapons on the
ship but we kind of need to bring

1894
00:59:06,069 --> 00:59:06,079
ship but we kind of need to bring
 

1895
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:08,270
ship but we kind of need to bring
weapons because what if we arrive at

1896
00:59:08,270 --> 00:59:08,280
weapons because what if we arrive at
 

1897
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:12,029
weapons because what if we arrive at
whatever planet and then they are

1898
00:59:12,029 --> 00:59:12,039
whatever planet and then they are
 

1899
00:59:12,039 --> 00:59:17,190
whatever planet and then they are
aggressive and so we have to fight back

1901
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,950

and so maybe we kind of need

1902
00:59:19,950 --> 00:59:19,960
and so maybe we kind of need
 

1903
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:23,349
and so maybe we kind of need
weapons um but they should be stored in

1904
00:59:23,349 --> 00:59:23,359
weapons um but they should be stored in
 

1905
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:26,069
weapons um but they should be stored in
a way that they can't be accept ible for
