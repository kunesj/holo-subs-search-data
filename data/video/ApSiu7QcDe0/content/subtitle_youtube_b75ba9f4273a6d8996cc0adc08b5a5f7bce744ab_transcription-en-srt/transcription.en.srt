would think about me and i would think
 

3585
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:06,229
would think about me and i would think
like that these people are like

3586
01:45:06,229 --> 01:45:06,239
like that these people are like
 

3587
01:45:06,239 --> 01:45:08,390
like that these people are like
only nice to me in front of me and

3588
01:45:08,390 --> 01:45:08,400
only nice to me in front of me and
 

3589
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:10,070
only nice to me in front of me and
behind my back when i'm not on the shift

3590
01:45:10,070 --> 01:45:10,080
behind my back when i'm not on the shift
 

3591
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:11,750
behind my back when i'm not on the shift
or whatever when i'm not at work

3592
01:45:11,750 --> 01:45:11,760
or whatever when i'm not at work
 

3593
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:13,590
or whatever when i'm not at work
that they probably like talk bad about

3594
01:45:13,590 --> 01:45:13,600
that they probably like talk bad about
 

3595
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:15,189
that they probably like talk bad about
me or make fun about me

3596

me or make fun about me
 

3597
01:45:15,199 --> 01:45:17,430
me or make fun about me
and in some way i still think that that

3598
01:45:17,430 --> 01:45:17,440
and in some way i still think that that
 

3599
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:19,510
and in some way i still think that that
might be might have been the case

3600
01:45:19,510 --> 01:45:19,520
might be might have been the case
 

3601
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:22,870
might be might have been the case
but but you

3602
01:45:22,870 --> 01:45:22,880
but but you
 

3603
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:24,870
but but you
in many cases when people think they're

3604
01:45:24,870 --> 01:45:24,880
in many cases when people think they're
 

3605
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:26,950
in many cases when people think they're
disliked by the people around them it's

3606
01:45:26,950 --> 01:45:26,960
disliked by the people around them it's
 

3607
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:29,109
disliked by the people around them it's
in many cases not true it's just like

3608
01:45:29,109 --> 01:45:29,119
in many cases not true it's just like
 

3609
01:45:29,119 --> 01:45:29,990
in many cases not true it's just like
you you're not

3610
01:45:29,990 --> 01:45:30,000

01:45:32,629 --> 01:45:32,639
having any confidence in yourself puts
 

3613
01:45:32,639 --> 01:45:34,550
having any confidence in yourself puts
this little bug inside your brain and

3614
01:45:34,550 --> 01:45:34,560
this little bug inside your brain and
 

3615
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:36,390
this little bug inside your brain and
makes you think that everyone hates you

3616

3617
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:38,709
makes you think that everyone hates you
often that's just in most cases that's

3618
01:45:38,709 --> 01:45:38,719
often that's just in most cases that's
 

3619
01:45:38,719 --> 01:45:41,189
often that's just in most cases that's
not the case in most cases people

3620
01:45:41,189 --> 01:45:41,199
not the case in most cases people

01:45:44,950 --> 01:45:44,960

 

3623
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:47,990

but you make yourself believe

3624
01:45:47,990 --> 01:45:48,000

so gotta gotta think about that

3628
01:45:55,910 --> 01:45:55,920
so gotta gotta think about that
 

3629
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:58,229
so gotta gotta think about that
do you actually have any proof that they

3630
01:45:58,229 --> 01:45:58,239
do you actually have any proof that they
 

3631
01:45:58,239 --> 01:46:00,070
do you actually have any proof that they
don't like you or is it all just inside

01:46:05,350 --> 01:46:05,360
hmm difficult difficult
 

3637
01:46:05,360 --> 01:46:08,149
hmm difficult difficult
yeah but i'm not saying that that what

3638
01:46:08,149 --> 01:46:08,159
yeah but i'm not saying that that what
 

3639
01:46:08,159 --> 01:46:10,629
yeah but i'm not saying that that what
tyso has experiences in his head but for

3640
01:46:10,629 --> 01:46:10,639
tyso has experiences in his head but for
 

3641
01:46:10,639 --> 01:46:12,070
tyso has experiences in his head but for
for the future now that he got a new

3642
01:46:12,070 --> 01:46:12,080
for the future now that he got a new
 

3643
01:46:12,080 --> 01:46:13,750
for the future now that he got a new
workplace and

3644
01:46:13,750 --> 01:46:13,760
workplace and
 

3645
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:15,910
workplace and
whenever he thinks like they dislike him

3646
01:46:15,910 --> 01:46:15,920
whenever he thinks like they dislike him
 

3647
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:17,990
whenever he thinks like they dislike him
maybe maybe that's

3648
01:46:17,990 --> 01:46:18,000
maybe maybe that's
 

3649
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,790
maybe maybe that's
if you don't have any actual proof of it

3650
01:46:20,790 --> 01:46:20,800
if you don't have any actual proof of it
 

3651
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:23,270
if you don't have any actual proof of it
yet

3652
01:46:23,270 --> 01:46:23,280

 

3653
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:25,350

maybe that's just maybe that in that

3654
01:46:25,350 --> 01:46:25,360
maybe that's just maybe that in that
 

3655
01:46:25,360 --> 01:46:27,109
maybe that's just maybe that in that
case is actually

3656
01:46:27,109 --> 01:46:27,119
case is actually
 

3657
01:46:27,119 --> 01:46:30,790
case is actually
really just you having no no confidence

3658
01:46:30,790 --> 01:46:30,800
really just you having no no confidence
 

3659
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:31,590
really just you having no no confidence
and

3660
01:46:31,590 --> 01:46:31,600
and
 

3661
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:32,950
and
thinking they just like you but they

3662
01:46:32,950 --> 01:46:32,960
thinking they just like you but they
 

3663
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:40,149
thinking they just like you but they
might actually like you hmm

3664
01:46:40,149 --> 01:46:40,159

 

3665
01:46:40,159 --> 01:46:42,229

you can always find a new job i mean

3666
01:46:42,229 --> 01:46:42,239
you can always find a new job i mean
 

3667
01:46:42,239 --> 01:46:43,669
you can always find a new job i mean
generally i guess so

3668
01:46:43,669 --> 01:46:43,679
generally i guess so
 

3669
01:46:43,679 --> 01:46:45,270
generally i guess so
but i think at the moment it's

3670
01:46:45,270 --> 01:46:45,280
but i think at the moment it's
 

3671
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:47,590
but i think at the moment it's
everywhere hard to get a new job

3672
01:46:47,590 --> 01:46:47,600
everywhere hard to get a new job
 

3673
