[Laughter]
 

3617
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:04,850
[Laughter]
because I used to use Firefox for a long

3618
01:35:04,850 --> 01:35:04,860
because I used to use Firefox for a long
 

3619
01:35:04,860 --> 01:35:07,669
because I used to use Firefox for a long
long time too the only reason I switched

3620
01:35:07,669 --> 01:35:07,679
long time too the only reason I switched
 

3621
01:35:07,679 --> 01:35:10,490
long time too the only reason I switched
to Chrome is because of the extensions I

3622
01:35:10,490 --> 01:35:10,500
to Chrome is because of the extensions I
 

3623
01:35:10,500 --> 01:35:12,410
to Chrome is because of the extensions I
guess

3624
01:35:12,410 --> 01:35:12,420
guess
 

3625
01:35:12,420 --> 01:35:14,209

even more difficult because of Twitter I
 

4693
02:02:28,260 --> 02:02:29,870
even more difficult because of Twitter I
don't even know if it's a bug or if

4694
02:02:29,870 --> 02:02:29,880
don't even know if it's a bug or if
 

4695
02:02:29,880 --> 02:02:31,850
don't even know if it's a bug or if
they're purposefully changed it because

4696
02:02:31,850 --> 02:02:31,860
they're purposefully changed it because
 

4697
02:02:31,860 --> 02:02:33,890
they're purposefully changed it because
I'm definitely not the only one who has

4698
02:02:33,890 --> 02:02:33,900
I'm definitely not the only one who has
 

4699
02:02:33,900 --> 02:02:35,089
I'm definitely not the only one who has
that issue

4700
02:02:35,089 --> 02:02:35,099
that issue
 

4701
02:02:35,099 --> 02:02:36,770
that issue
with the reply it's not showing up in

4702
02:02:36,770 --> 02:02:36,780
with the reply it's not showing up in
 

4703
02:02:36,780 --> 02:02:38,510
with the reply it's not showing up in
the reply section anymore unless it's

4704
02:02:38,510 --> 02:02:38,520
the reply section anymore unless it's
 

4705
02:02:38,520 --> 02:02:41,870
the reply section anymore unless it's
like a indirect reply which is so stupid

4706
02:02:41,870 --> 02:02:41,880
like a indirect reply which is so stupid
 

4707
02:02:41,880 --> 02:02:45,530
like a indirect reply which is so stupid
that cannot possibly be like

4708
02:02:45,530 --> 02:02:45,540
that cannot possibly be like
 

4709
02:02:45,540 --> 02:02:47,390
that cannot possibly be like
a future a feature that they

4710
02:02:47,390 --> 02:02:47,400
a future a feature that they
 

4711
02:02:47,400 --> 02:02:49,189
a future a feature that they
purposefully implemented

4712
02:02:49,189 --> 02:02:49,199
purposefully implemented
 

4713
02:02:49,199 --> 02:02:51,350
purposefully implemented
because that makes no sense why in my

4714
02:02:51,350 --> 02:02:51,360
because that makes no sense why in my
 

4715
02:02:51,360 --> 02:02:54,649
because that makes no sense why in my
reply section are there no replies why

4716
02:02:54,649 --> 02:02:54,659
reply section are there no replies why
 

4717
02:02:54,659 --> 02:02:57,729
reply section are there no replies why
are the only replies in my reply section

4718
02:02:57,729 --> 02:02:57,739
are the only replies in my reply section
 

4719
02:02:57,739 --> 02:03:01,910
are the only replies in my reply section
the ones that are indirect replies

4720
02:03:01,910 --> 02:03:01,920
the ones that are indirect replies
 

4721
02:03:01,920 --> 02:03:05,629
the ones that are indirect replies
like replies to another person's reply

4722
02:03:05,629 --> 02:03:05,639
like replies to another person's reply
 

4723
02:03:05,639 --> 02:03:08,149
like replies to another person's reply
to me hmm

4724
02:03:08,149 --> 02:03:08,159
to me hmm
 

4725
02:03:08,159 --> 02:03:10,189
to me hmm
like think about it logically I mean

4726
02:03:10,189 --> 02:03:10,199
like think about it logically I mean
 

4727
02:03:10,199 --> 02:03:13,689
like think about it logically I mean
Twitter has been doing some weird stuff

4728
02:03:13,689 --> 02:03:13,699
Twitter has been doing some weird stuff
 

4729
02:03:13,699 --> 02:03:16,490
Twitter has been doing some weird stuff
recently in the past months but that

4730
02:03:16,490 --> 02:03:16,500
recently in the past months but that
 

4731
02:03:16,500 --> 02:03:18,470
recently in the past months but that
doesn't even make any sense like why

4732
02:03:18,470 --> 02:03:18,480
doesn't even make any sense like why
 

4733
02:03:18,480 --> 02:03:20,510
doesn't even make any sense like why
would you do that I'm just it's not

4734
02:03:20,510 --> 02:03:20,520
would you do that I'm just it's not
 

4735
02:03:20,520 --> 02:03:24,350
would you do that I'm just it's not
logical is it

4736
02:03:24,350 --> 02:03:24,360

 

4737
02:03:24,360 --> 02:03:27,709

it doesn't make sense

4738
02:03:27,709 --> 02:03:27,719

 

4739
02:03:27,719 --> 02:03:29,750

so that made it difficult to keep up

4740
02:03:29,750 --> 02:03:29,760
so that made it difficult to keep up
 

4741
02:03:29,760 --> 02:03:30,830
so that made it difficult to keep up
with it

4742
02:03:30,830 --> 02:03:30,840
with it
 

4743
02:03:30,840 --> 02:03:33,709
with it
because even if I go to my actual tweet

4744
02:03:33,709 --> 02:03:33,719
because even if I go to my actual tweet
 

4745
02:03:33,719 --> 02:03:35,990
because even if I go to my actual tweet
and then directly look at the replies

4746
02:03:35,990 --> 02:03:36,000
and then directly look at the replies
 

4747
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:36,830
and then directly look at the replies
there

4748
02:03:36,830 --> 02:03:36,840
there
 

4749
02:03:36,840 --> 02:03:39,470
there
not chronologically sorted and there's

4750
02:03:39,470 --> 02:03:39,480
not chronologically sorted and there's
 

4751
02:03:39,480 --> 02:03:41,750
not chronologically sorted and there's
no way to chronologically sort them

4752
02:03:41,750 --> 02:03:41,760
no way to chronologically sort them
 

4753
02:03:41,760 --> 02:03:43,790
no way to chronologically sort them
there so

4754
02:03:43,790 --> 02:03:43,800
there so
 

4755
02:03:43,800 --> 02:03:48,109
there so
I I can I would go there once after a

4756
02:03:48,109 --> 02:03:48,119
I I can I would go there once after a
 

4757
02:03:48,119 --> 02:03:50,510
I I can I would go there once after a
stream and go for everything that's

4758
02:03:50,510 --> 02:03:50,520
stream and go for everything that's
 

4759
02:03:50,520 --> 02:03:52,010
stream and go for everything that's
there at that point at the time but I

4760
02:03:52,010 --> 02:03:52,020
there at that point at the time but I
 

4761
02:03:52,020 --> 02:03:53,689
there at that point at the time but I
can't continuously keep on coming back

4762
02:03:53,689 --> 02:03:53,699
can't continuously keep on coming back
 

4763
02:03:53,699 --> 02:03:55,189
can't continuously keep on coming back
and look for new ones especially if

4764
02:03:55,189 --> 02:03:55,199
and look for new ones especially if
 

4765
02:03:55,199 --> 02:03:56,810
and look for new ones especially if
they're not even chronologically solid

4766
02:03:56,810 --> 02:03:56,820
they're not even chronologically solid
 

4767
02:03:56,820 --> 02:04:00,410
they're not even chronologically solid
but like mixed in between

4768
02:04:00,410 --> 02:04:00,420
but like mixed in between
 

4769
02:04:00,420 --> 02:04:02,570
but like mixed in between
um yeah and then I have to like look for

4770
02:04:02,570 --> 02:04:02,580
um yeah and then I have to like look for
 

4771
02:04:02,580 --> 02:04:04,550

the new ones
 

4773
02:04:04,560 --> 02:04:08,390
the new ones
in the middle of so many old ones

4774
02:04:08,390 --> 02:04:08,400
in the middle of so many old ones
 

4775
02:04:08,400 --> 02:04:10,729
in the middle of so many old ones

tweet replies
a little mix of everything

4786
02:04:22,669 --> 02:04:22,679
a little mix of everything
 

4787
02:04:22,679 --> 02:04:24,830
a little mix of everything
but in the end it's both like not really

like she was far away but still just
 

5083
02:11:27,900 --> 02:11:29,870

but I guess when you would cook it
 

5413
02:18:54,420 --> 02:18:56,209
but I guess when you would cook it
normally and eat it then maybe you would

5414
02:18:56,209 --> 02:18:56,219
normally and eat it then maybe you would
 

5415
02:18:56,219 --> 02:18:57,410
