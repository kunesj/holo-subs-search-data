1327
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:37,130

1328
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:37,140
Maybe
 

1329
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:39,589
Maybe
so it will come out of here

1330
00:39:39,589 --> 00:39:39,599
so it will come out of here
 

1331
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:42,050
so it will come out of here
and is that on the same level no it's

1332
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:42,060
and is that on the same level no it's
 

1333

well first here
 

1339
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,870
well first here
so it goes right there and it goes from

1340
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:53,880
so it goes right there and it goes from
 

1341
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,030
so it goes right there and it goes from
there and then maybe we make it go

1342
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:56,040
there and then maybe we make it go
 

1343
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:59,450
there and then maybe we make it go
through here

1344

1345
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,849

1346
00:40:01,849 --> 00:40:01,859
but then it just goes for here again
 

1347
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:06,530

do it right oh now I'll have more
momentum oh where did it go I'll have

1660
00:48:07,849 --> 00:48:07,859
momentum oh where did it go I'll have
 

1661
00:48:07,859 --> 00:48:13,089
momentum oh where did it go I'll have
more momentum because I was even higher

1662

doesn't it does it yeah so you make a
 

1721
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:43,130
doesn't it does it yeah so you make a
portal there but I don't want to go

1722
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:43,140
portal there but I don't want to go
 

1723
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:45,410
portal there but I don't want to go
there you make a portal

1724

here to over there
 

1767
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:48,470
here to over there
and when it was there it went over to

1768
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:48,480
and when it was there it went over to
 

1769
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,329
and when it was there it went over to
that side and activated what I wanted it

1770

1983
00:56:20,059 --> 00:56:24,710

okay uh how about we start like this we

1984
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:24,720
okay uh how about we start like this we
 

1985
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,809
okay uh how about we start like this we
take this isn't this easier than what we

1986
00:56:26,809 --> 00:56:26,819
take this isn't this easier than what we
 

1987
00:56:26,819 --> 00:56:28,190
take this isn't this easier than what we
just did

1988
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:28,200
just did
 

1989
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:30,410
just did
oh because I said it's going to take a

1990
00:56:30,410 --> 00:56:30,420
oh because I said it's going to take a
 

1991
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:34,670
oh because I said it's going to take a
long time and that's a lie so we go here

1992
00:56:34,670 --> 00:56:34,680
long time and that's a lie so we go here
 

1993
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:37,250
long time and that's a lie so we go here
we go through here

1994
00:56:37,250 --> 00:56:37,260
we go through here
 

1995
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:40,190
we go through here
oh well now mine it might just take long

1996
00:56:40,190 --> 00:56:40,200
oh well now mine it might just take long
 

1997
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,870
oh well now mine it might just take long
because it might actually take long

1998
00:56:41,870 --> 00:56:41,880
because it might actually take long
 

1999
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:45,289
because it might actually take long
because this looks complicated

2000
00:56:45,289 --> 00:56:45,299

 

2001
00:56:45,299 --> 00:56:46,309

and then
and then we try to activate this so one

2024
00:57:17,990 --> 00:57:18,000
and then we try to activate this so one
 

2025
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,150

there then it will reflect it and it
 

4805
02:14:09,360 --> 02:14:12,169
there then it will reflect it and it
will go somewhere else

we can touch the button
 

5477
02:33:23,220 --> 02:33:25,010
we can touch the button
for a portal

5478
02:33:25,010 --> 02:33:25,020
for a portal
 

5479
02:33:25,020 --> 02:33:27,770
for a portal
but

but
 

5481
02:33:27,780 --> 02:33:30,950
but
we need to make the laser

02:33:46,969 --> 02:33:46,979
um we first place a blue portal here and
 

5495
02:33:46,979 --> 02:33:48,349

while
 

5497
02:33:48,359 --> 02:33:51,830
while
it is making its way from here to here

it is making its way from here to here
 

5499
02:33:51,840 --> 02:33:54,290
it is making its way from here to here
because the distance is pretty long we

5500
02:33:54,290 --> 02:33:54,300
because the distance is pretty long we
 

5501
02:33:54,300 --> 02:33:57,010
because the distance is pretty long we
may have enough time

5502

may have enough time
 

5503
02:33:57,020 --> 02:34:00,230
may have enough time
uh to make another portal here which

5504
02:34:00,230 --> 02:34:00,240
uh to make another portal here which
 

5505
02:34:00,240 --> 02:34:01,550
uh to make another portal here which
will be

5506
02:34:01,550 --> 02:34:01,560
