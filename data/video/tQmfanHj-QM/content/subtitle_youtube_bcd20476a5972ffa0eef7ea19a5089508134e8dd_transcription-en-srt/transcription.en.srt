because of reasons spoiler
reasons and then so we basically I can

382
00:15:37,189 --> 00:15:37,199
reasons and then so we basically I can
 

383
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:41,829
reasons and then so we basically I can
either I I I collected opinions what I

384
00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:41,839
either I I I collected opinions what I
 

385
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,550
either I I I collected opinions what I
can do is

386
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:44,560
can do is
 

387
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,870
can do is
either collect Tiki which will take 3

388
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:48,880
either collect Tiki which will take 3
 

389
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,550
either collect Tiki which will take 3
hours minimum so apparently it's very

390
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:52,560
hours minimum so apparently it's very
 

391
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,629
hours minimum so apparently it's very
difficult to get Ticky or long

392
00:15:55,629 --> 00:15:55,639
difficult to get Ticky or long
 

393
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:59,710
difficult to get Ticky or long
long uh and then have an easier time

394
00:15:59,710 --> 00:15:59,720
long uh and then have an easier time
 

395
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,069
long uh and then have an easier time
later

396
00:16:01,069 --> 00:16:01,079
later
 

397
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:05,710
later
on or do not get

398
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:05,720

but at the same time
 

405
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,030
but at the same time
story-wise it will make more

406
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:19,040

 

407
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,910

00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:34,319
imagine why it would make sense or why
 

417
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:36,949

get Ticky the more it's difficult even

426
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:48,880
get Ticky the more it's difficult even
 

427
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,350

it's
 

431
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,069
it's
scaling so it shouldn't be more

432
00:16:54,069 --> 00:16:54,079
scaling so it shouldn't be more
 

433
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,790

difficult but maybe it's not scaling

434
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:56,800
difficult but maybe it's not scaling
 

435
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:03,230
