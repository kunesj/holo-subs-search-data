7120
03:06:50,030 --> 03:06:50,040
and I put like a long time ago I built
 

7121
03:06:50,040 --> 03:06:53,830
and I put like a long time ago I built
in the never in our main like never

7122
03:06:53,830 --> 03:06:53,840
in the never in our main like never
 

7123
03:06:53,840 --> 03:06:59,030
in the never in our main like never
portal Place uh we I built an ice path

7124
03:06:59,030 --> 03:06:59,040
portal Place uh we I built an ice path
 

7125
03:06:59,040 --> 03:07:00,490
portal Place uh we I built an ice path
an ice

7126
03:07:00,490 --> 03:07:00,500
an ice
 

7127
03:07:00,500 --> 03:07:04,610
an ice
rail before to get to the Mesa biome

7128
03:07:04,610 --> 03:07:04,620
rail before to get to the Mesa biome
 

7129
03:07:04,620 --> 03:07:08,150
rail before to get to the Mesa biome
okay yeah and uh that's a long time ago

7130
03:07:08,150 --> 03:07:08,160
okay yeah and uh that's a long time ago
 

7131
03:07:08,160 --> 03:07:12,010
okay yeah and uh that's a long time ago
but today I wanted to find the Sakura uh

7132
03:07:12,010 --> 03:07:12,020
but today I wanted to find the Sakura uh
 

7133
03:07:12,020 --> 03:07:14,990
but today I wanted to find the Sakura uh
and so for that I I thought okay I'll

7134
03:07:14,990 --> 03:07:15,000
and so for that I I thought okay I'll
 

7135
03:07:15,000 --> 03:07:17,570
and so for that I I thought okay I'll
use my eyes track and I'll go even

7136
03:07:17,570 --> 03:07:17,580
use my eyes track and I'll go even
 

7137
03:07:17,580 --> 03:07:20,389
use my eyes track and I'll go even
further and then I continue to extend

7138
03:07:20,389 --> 03:07:20,399
further and then I continue to extend
 

7139
03:07:20,399 --> 03:07:22,730
further and then I continue to extend
the ice path and now I'm basically like

7140
03:07:22,730 --> 03:07:22,740
the ice path and now I'm basically like
 

7141
03:07:22,740 --> 03:07:25,130
the ice path and now I'm basically like
really really far away and trying to

7142
03:07:25,130 --> 03:07:25,140
really really far away and trying to
 

7143
03:07:25,140 --> 03:07:28,969
really really far away and trying to
build the ice path from the very very

7144
03:07:28,969 --> 03:07:28,979
build the ice path from the very very
 

7145
03:07:28,979 --> 03:07:31,849
build the ice path from the very very
other side where I'm far away and then

7146
03:07:31,849 --> 03:07:31,859
other side where I'm far away and then
 

7147
03:07:31,859 --> 03:07:34,670
other side where I'm far away and then
make it meet you know I wanted to meet

7148

7157
03:07:47,880 --> 03:07:50,809
um you know XYZ I'm I think I'm close to
the X path where I should be but I'm not

7158
03:07:50,809 --> 03:07:50,819
the X path where I should be but I'm not
 

7159
03:07:50,819 --> 03:07:53,090
the X path where I should be but I'm not
sure where exactly I needed to be exact

7160
03:07:53,090 --> 03:07:53,100
sure where exactly I needed to be exact
 

7161

I mean
 

7165
03:07:57,140 --> 03:08:00,110
I mean
oh actually there is a calculator about

7166
03:08:00,110 --> 03:08:00,120
oh actually there is a calculator about
 

7167
03:08:00,120 --> 03:08:03,050
oh actually there is a calculator about
the nether portal in the Overworld oh

7168
03:08:03,050 --> 03:08:03,060
the nether portal in the Overworld oh
 

7169
03:08:03,060 --> 03:08:04,730
the nether portal in the Overworld oh
yeah but I'm I'm already in the never

03:08:04,730 --> 03:08:04,740
yeah but I'm I'm already in the never
 

7171
03:08:04,740 --> 03:08:07,010
yeah but I'm I'm already in the never
and the other side is also than ever I

7172
03:08:07,010 --> 03:08:07,020
and the other side is also than ever I
 

7173
03:08:07,020 --> 03:08:09,769
and the other side is also than ever I
just need the the path to me so for that

7174
03:08:09,769 --> 03:08:09,779
just need the the path to me so for that
 

7175
03:08:09,779 --> 03:08:12,230
just need the the path to me so for that
I would ask you to go to the beginning

7176
03:08:12,230 --> 03:08:12,240
I would ask you to go to the beginning
 

7177
03:08:12,240 --> 03:08:14,929
I would ask you to go to the beginning
of my ice road because I'm not in the

7178
03:08:14,929 --> 03:08:14,939
of my ice road because I'm not in the
 

7179
03:08:14,939 --> 03:08:18,530
of my ice road because I'm not in the
ending of it and just tell me the X okay

7180
03:08:18,530 --> 03:08:18,540
ending of it and just tell me the X okay
 

7181

9371
04:02:08,340 --> 04:02:10,969
makes sense
this way right

9372
04:02:10,969 --> 04:02:10,979
this way right
 

9373
04:02:10,979 --> 04:02:13,429
this way right
and I had a four

9374

04:02:15,530 --> 04:02:15,540
wait we can even adjust I think it was
 

9377
04:02:15,540 --> 04:02:19,070
wait we can even adjust I think it was
19 right so this height would be

9378
04:02:19,070 --> 04:02:19,080
19 right so this height would be
 

9379
04:02:19,080 --> 04:02:25,370
19 right so this height would be
yeah that's exactly

9380
04:02:25,370 --> 04:02:25,380

 

9381
04:02:25,380 --> 04:02:26,889

success

9382
04:02:26,889 --> 04:02:26,899
success
 

9383
04:02:26,899 --> 04:02:33,950

we can finally continue guys exciting

9384
04:02:33,950 --> 04:02:33,960

I think right

9390
04:02:40,010 --> 04:02:40,020
I think right
 

9391
04:02:40,020 --> 04:02:46,660

so I need one more level lower I think

9392
04:02:46,660 --> 04:02:46,670

takes up no space so I'm thinking of

9870
04:13:18,050 --> 04:13:18,060
takes up no space so I'm thinking of
 

9871
04:13:18,060 --> 04:13:20,689
takes up no space so I'm thinking of
bringing it to Japan as well

9872
04:13:20,689 --> 04:13:20,699
bringing it to Japan as well
 

9873
04:13:20,699 --> 04:13:22,790
bringing it to Japan as well
and I'm going yeah rowing a boat yeah

9874
04:13:22,790 --> 04:13:22,800
and I'm going yeah rowing a boat yeah
 

9875
04:13:22,800 --> 04:13:25,070
and I'm going yeah rowing a boat yeah
rowing a boat I mean I have the rowing

9876
04:13:25,070 --> 04:13:25,080
rowing a boat I mean I have the rowing
 

9877
04:13:25,080 --> 04:13:26,210
rowing a boat I mean I have the rowing
machine

9878
04:13:26,210 --> 04:13:26,220
machine
 

9879
04:13:26,220 --> 04:13:28,849
machine
but I I I I don't know about the rowing

9880
04:13:28,849 --> 04:13:28,859
but I I I I don't know about the rowing
 

9881
04:13:28,859 --> 04:13:30,889
but I I I I don't know about the rowing
machine I

9882
04:13:30,889 --> 04:13:30,899
machine I
 

9883
04:13:30,899 --> 04:13:31,910
machine I
how are they fine

9884
04:13:31,910 --> 04:13:31,920
how are they fine
 

9885
04:13:31,920 --> 04:13:33,110
how are they fine

9889
04:13:37,739 --> 04:13:39,590

oh well

9890
04:13:39,590 --> 04:13:39,600
oh well
 

9891
04:13:39,600 --> 04:13:42,710
oh well
the rowing machine I feel like I I think

9892
04:13:42,710 --> 04:13:42,720
the rowing machine I feel like I I think
 

9893
04:13:42,720 --> 04:13:44,150
the rowing machine I feel like I I think
there's there's something with my rowing

9894
04:13:44,150 --> 04:13:44,160
there's there's something with my rowing
 

9895
04:13:44,160 --> 04:13:45,710
there's there's something with my rowing
machine that I don't know I have to make

9896
04:13:45,710 --> 04:13:45,720
machine that I don't know I have to make
 

9897
04:13:45,720 --> 04:13:47,750
machine that I don't know I have to make
some setting or so because I think it's

9898
04:13:47,750 --> 04:13:47,760
some setting or so because I think it's
 

9899
04:13:47,760 --> 04:13:48,830
some setting or so because I think it's
like

9900
04:13:48,830 --> 04:13:48,840
like
 

9901
04:13:48,840 --> 04:13:50,750
like
and maybe it's because it's such a cheap

9902
04:13:50,750 --> 04:13:50,760
and maybe it's because it's such a cheap
 

9903
04:13:50,760 --> 04:13:52,550
and maybe it's because it's such a cheap
one because there's different types of

9904
04:13:52,550 --> 04:13:52,560
one because there's different types of
 

9905
04:13:52,560 --> 04:13:56,510
one because there's different types of
rowing machines as far as I know

9906
04:13:56,510 --> 04:13:56,520
rowing machines as far as I know
 

9907
04:13:56,520 --> 04:13:59,150
rowing machines as far as I know
I bought a rowing machine yeah a while

9908
04:13:59,150 --> 04:13:59,160
I bought a rowing machine yeah a while
 

9909
04:13:59,160 --> 04:14:01,550
I bought a rowing machine yeah a while
ago didn't I did I not tell you

9910
04:14:01,550 --> 04:14:01,560
ago didn't I did I not tell you
 

9911
04:14:01,560 --> 04:14:04,910
ago didn't I did I not tell you
I feel like I told you I bought a rowing

9912
04:14:04,910 --> 04:14:04,920
I feel like I told you I bought a rowing
 

9913
04:14:04,920 --> 04:14:07,910
I feel like I told you I bought a rowing
machine

9914
04:14:07,910 --> 04:14:07,920

 

9915
04:14:07,920 --> 04:14:09,710

because I wanted to be able to do it

9916
04:14:09,710 --> 04:14:09,720
because I wanted to be able to do it
 

9917
04:14:09,720 --> 04:14:13,490
because I wanted to be able to do it
whenever at home but mine's kind of like

9918
04:14:13,490 --> 04:14:13,500
whenever at home but mine's kind of like
 

9919
04:14:13,500 --> 04:14:16,910
whenever at home but mine's kind of like
I feel like it has barely any resistance

9920
04:14:16,910 --> 04:14:16,920
I feel like it has barely any resistance
 

9921
04:14:16,920 --> 04:14:20,510
I feel like it has barely any resistance
and that's probably because

9922
04:14:20,510 --> 04:14:20,520
and that's probably because
 

9923
04:14:20,520 --> 04:14:22,309
and that's probably because
it's like one of those cheap ones

9924
04:14:22,309 --> 04:14:22,319
it's like one of those cheap ones
 

9925
04:14:22,319 --> 04:14:24,650
it's like one of those cheap ones
because I don't like don't they usually

9926
04:14:24,650 --> 04:14:24,660
because I don't like don't they usually
 

9927
04:14:24,660 --> 04:14:27,229
because I don't like don't they usually
work with like water or something I

9928
04:14:27,229 --> 04:14:27,239
work with like water or something I
 

9929
04:14:27,239 --> 04:14:29,269
work with like water or something I
don't know there's like water or

9930
04:14:29,269 --> 04:14:29,279
don't know there's like water or
 

9931
04:14:29,279 --> 04:14:31,790
don't know there's like water or
something inside and then the one that I

9932
04:14:31,790 --> 04:14:31,800
something inside and then the one that I
 

9933
04:14:31,800 --> 04:14:33,229
something inside and then the one that I
have Works kind of differently that's

9934
04:14:33,229 --> 04:14:33,239
have Works kind of differently that's
 

9935
04:14:33,239 --> 04:14:35,330
have Works kind of differently that's
why it was cheaper and so it has less

9936
04:14:35,330 --> 04:14:35,340
why it was cheaper and so it has less
 

9937
04:14:35,340 --> 04:14:37,130
why it was cheaper and so it has less
resistance but I wonder if if there

9938
04:14:37,130 --> 04:14:37,140
resistance but I wonder if if there
 

9939
04:14:37,140 --> 04:14:39,469
resistance but I wonder if if there
isn't like something

9940
04:14:39,469 --> 04:14:39,479
isn't like something
 

9941
04:14:39,479 --> 04:14:42,830
isn't like something
some kind of like setting or something

9942
04:14:42,830 --> 04:14:42,840
some kind of like setting or something
 

9943
04:14:42,840 --> 04:14:45,469
some kind of like setting or something
that I don't know I have to change in

9944
04:14:45,469 --> 04:14:45,479
that I don't know I have to change in
 

9945
04:14:45,479 --> 04:14:49,910
that I don't know I have to change in
order to use it to its full potential

9946
04:14:49,910 --> 04:14:49,920
order to use it to its full potential
 

9947
04:14:49,920 --> 04:14:52,070
order to use it to its full potential
I don't know what I'm doing wrong

9948
04:14:52,070 --> 04:14:52,080
I don't know what I'm doing wrong
 

9949
04:14:52,080 --> 04:14:54,469
I don't know what I'm doing wrong
but at least the resistance bands I can

9950
04:14:54,469 --> 04:14:54,479
but at least the resistance bands I can
 

9951
04:14:54,479 --> 04:14:55,610
but at least the resistance bands I can
like take

9952
04:14:55,610 --> 04:14:55,620
like take
 

9953
04:14:55,620 --> 04:14:57,530
like take
everywhere and they're small and there's

9954
04:14:57,530 --> 04:14:57,540
everywhere and they're small and there's
 

9955
04:14:57,540 --> 04:15:01,389
everywhere and they're small and there's
also variations of enough

9956
04:15:01,389 --> 04:15:01,399
also variations of enough
 

9957
04:15:01,399 --> 04:15:03,729

that you need full potential

9960
04:15:08,570 --> 04:15:08,580
that you need full potential
 

9961
04:15:08,580 --> 04:15:11,870
that you need full potential
I did not read the manual but wow

9962
04:15:11,870 --> 04:15:11,880
I did not read the manual but wow
 

9963
04:15:11,880 --> 04:15:14,630
I did not read the manual but wow
not really I don't think I mean I read

9964
04:15:14,630 --> 04:15:14,640
not really I don't think I mean I read
 

9965
04:15:14,640 --> 04:15:17,450
not really I don't think I mean I read
the manual on how to put together the

9966
04:15:17,450 --> 04:15:17,460
the manual on how to put together the
 

9967
04:15:17,460 --> 04:15:20,030
the manual on how to put together the
rowing machine which is already quite

9968
04:15:20,030 --> 04:15:20,040
rowing machine which is already quite
 

9969
04:15:20,040 --> 04:15:23,870
rowing machine which is already quite
something I would say

9970
04:15:23,870 --> 04:15:23,880

 

9971
04:15:23,880 --> 04:15:31,010

I'm doing all this on my own you know

9972
04:15:31,010 --> 04:15:31,020

 

9973
04:15:31,020 --> 04:15:36,050

hmm
 

9977
04:15:38,040 --> 04:15:41,030
hmm
there's a technique to do it effectively

9978
04:15:41,030 --> 04:15:41,040
there's a technique to do it effectively
 

9979
04:15:41,040 --> 04:15:43,309
there's a technique to do it effectively
yeah I feel like that shouldn't be too

9980
04:15:43,309 --> 04:15:43,319
yeah I feel like that shouldn't be too
 

9981
04:15:43,319 --> 04:15:49,020
yeah I feel like that shouldn't be too
difficult to get that down

11579
04:53:30,718 --> 04:53:33,470
but I found
I I figured out

04:53:33,470 --> 04:53:33,480
I I figured out
 

11581
04:53:33,480 --> 04:53:39,730
I I figured out
a way to get free motion capture

which makes me think I mean that was

11588
04:53:46,788 --> 04:53:46,798
which makes me think I mean that was
 

11589
04:53:46,798 --> 04:53:50,930
which makes me think I mean that was
only a small part of the cost

04:53:50,930 --> 04:53:50,940
only a small part of the cost
 

11591

11601
04:54:07,500 --> 04:54:10,850
