01:09:45,510 --> 01:09:45,520
there's a coin there but i think i have
 

2787
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:47,510
there's a coin there but i think i have
to go first the right side on the wheel

2788
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:47,520
to go first the right side on the wheel
 

2789
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,189
to go first the right side on the wheel
and then jump down kind of from the

01:09:49,189 --> 01:09:49,199
and then jump down kind of from the
 

2791
01:09:49,199 --> 01:09:50,309
and then jump down kind of from the
wheel

wheel
 

2793
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:55,590

i'm actually considering playing a

5614
02:22:27,910 --> 02:22:27,920
i'm actually considering playing a
 

5615
02:22:27,920 --> 02:22:31,510
i'm actually considering playing a
a tails off game

5616
02:22:31,510 --> 02:22:31,520

 

5617
02:22:31,520 --> 02:22:34,230

possibly one i haven't

5618
02:22:34,230 --> 02:22:34,240
possibly one i haven't

02:22:34,240 --> 02:22:35,910
possibly one i haven't
no you're not gonna take the flame away

5620
02:22:35,910 --> 02:22:35,920
no you're not gonna take the flame away
 

5621
02:22:35,920 --> 02:22:39,030
no you're not gonna take the flame away
from me there you go

5622
02:22:39,030 --> 02:22:39,040
from me there you go
 

5623
02:22:39,040 --> 02:22:40,309
from me there you go
you're not gonna take it away from me

5624
02:22:40,309 --> 02:22:40,319
you're not gonna take it away from me
 

5625
02:22:40,319 --> 02:22:43,750
you're not gonna take it away from me
either

5626
02:22:43,750 --> 02:22:43,760

 

5627
02:22:43,760 --> 02:22:51,750

what is this approach

5628
02:22:51,750 --> 02:22:51,760

 

5629
02:22:51,760 --> 02:22:53,590

yeah um

5630
02:22:53,590 --> 02:22:53,600
yeah um
 

5631
02:22:53,600 --> 02:22:57,190
yeah um
maybe i was thinking symphonia too

5632
02:22:57,190 --> 02:22:57,200
maybe i was thinking symphonia too
 

5633
02:22:57,200 --> 02:22:59,110
maybe i was thinking symphonia too
because i've played sinfonia one before

5634
02:22:59,110 --> 02:22:59,120
because i've played sinfonia one before
 

5635
02:22:59,120 --> 02:23:00,870
because i've played sinfonia one before
but now i'm just wondering maybe for the

5636
02:23:00,870 --> 02:23:00,880
but now i'm just wondering maybe for the
 

5637
02:23:00,880 --> 02:23:02,710
but now i'm just wondering maybe for the
sake of the stream i should not just

5638
02:23:02,710 --> 02:23:02,720
sake of the stream i should not just
 

5639
02:23:02,720 --> 02:23:04,790
sake of the stream i should not just
start with sinfonia too

5640
02:23:04,790 --> 02:23:04,800
start with sinfonia too
 

5641
02:23:04,800 --> 02:23:06,630
start with sinfonia too
should i be playing

5642
02:23:06,630 --> 02:23:06,640
should i be playing
 

5643
02:23:06,640 --> 02:23:08,469
should i be playing
the whole

5644
02:23:08,469 --> 02:23:08,479
the whole
 

5645
02:23:08,479 --> 02:23:09,590
the whole
series

5646
02:23:09,590 --> 02:23:09,600
series
 

5647
02:23:09,600 --> 02:23:11,030
series
i don't know that would take so much

5648
02:23:11,030 --> 02:23:11,040
i don't know that would take so much
 

5649
02:23:11,040 --> 02:23:12,870
i don't know that would take so much
time and would be such a long commitment

5650
02:23:12,870 --> 02:23:12,880
time and would be such a long commitment
 

5651
02:23:12,880 --> 02:23:15,750
time and would be such a long commitment
have any viewers here play symphonia one
