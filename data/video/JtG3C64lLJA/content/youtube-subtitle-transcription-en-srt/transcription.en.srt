02:02:36,830 --> 02:02:36,840
um there's like two two strategies you
 

5125
02:02:36,840 --> 02:02:39,470
um there's like two two strategies you
can either do like a wave you know or

5126
02:02:39,470 --> 02:02:39,480
can either do like a wave you know or
 

5127
02:02:39,480 --> 02:02:41,209
can either do like a wave you know or
you can wrap it around the straightening

5128

you can wrap it around the straightening
 

5129
02:02:41,219 --> 02:02:44,209
you can wrap it around the straightening
iron and then just pull it down that

5130
02:02:44,209 --> 02:02:44,219
iron and then just pull it down that
 

5131
02:02:44,219 --> 02:02:46,570
iron and then just pull it down that
works now

5132
02:02:46,570 --> 02:02:46,580
