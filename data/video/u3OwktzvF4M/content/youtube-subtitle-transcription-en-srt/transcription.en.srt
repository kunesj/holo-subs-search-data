is it like a material world is it a
 

4881
01:55:22,679 --> 01:55:24,830
is it like a material world is it a
digital world I don't know is it a

4882
01:55:24,830 --> 01:55:24,840
digital world I don't know is it a
 

4883
01:55:24,840 --> 01:55:26,930
digital world I don't know is it a
simulation something it's another

yes hola possibly possible
I I created a special technology that

4892
01:55:39,649 --> 01:55:39,659
I I created a special technology that
 

4893
01:55:39,659 --> 01:55:41,270
I I created a special technology that
could copy the Hedge

4894
01:55:41,270 --> 01:55:41,280
could copy the Hedge
 

4895
01:55:41,280 --> 01:55:43,490
could copy the Hedge
I copied it and made some modifications

4896
01:55:43,490 --> 01:55:43,500
I copied it and made some modifications
 

4897
01:55:43,500 --> 01:55:47,629
I copied it and made some modifications
of my own but there are no humans in

4898
01:55:47,629 --> 01:55:47,639
of my own but there are no humans in
 

4899
01:55:47,639 --> 01:55:50,390
of my own but there are no humans in
here except for you

4900
01:55:50,390 --> 01:55:50,400
here except for you
 

4901
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:54,050

I thought

4906
01:55:58,669 --> 01:55:58,679
I thought
 

4907
01:55:58,679 --> 01:56:00,890
I thought
because you four are

4908
01:56:00,890 --> 01:56:00,900
because you four are
 

4909
01:56:00,900 --> 01:56:02,990

always said to you know plan for
 

4919
01:56:15,260 --> 01:56:18,109
always said to you know plan for
multiple possibilities in every

4920
01:56:18,109 --> 01:56:18,119
multiple possibilities in every
 

4921
01:56:18,119 --> 01:56:20,990

you went against your philosophy

4924
01:56:24,530 --> 01:56:24,540
you went against your philosophy
 

4925
01:56:24,540 --> 01:56:28,910
you went against your philosophy
like I said I wasn't in my right mind

4926

like I said I wasn't in my right mind
maybe another whack with my broom you'll

4928
01:56:31,129 --> 01:56:31,139
maybe another whack with my broom you'll
 

4929
01:56:31,139 --> 01:56:33,290
maybe another whack with my broom you'll
be in your right mind you can get out of

4930
01:56:33,290 --> 01:56:33,300
be in your right mind you can get out of
 

4931
01:56:33,300 --> 01:56:35,990
be in your right mind you can get out of
here I suppose I deserve that

4932
01:56:35,990 --> 01:56:36,000
here I suppose I deserve that
 

4933
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:37,669
here I suppose I deserve that
no

4934
01:56:37,669 --> 01:56:37,679
no
 

4935
01:56:37,679 --> 01:56:40,609
no
now if you help us

4936
01:56:40,609 --> 01:56:40,619
now if you help us
 

4937
01:56:40,619 --> 01:56:44,169
now if you help us
I mean is it is it impossible to create

4938
01:56:44,169 --> 01:56:44,179
I mean is it is it impossible to create
 

4939
01:56:44,179 --> 01:56:48,350
I mean is it is it impossible to create
or copy humans

4940
01:56:48,350 --> 01:56:48,360
or copy humans
 

4941
01:56:48,360 --> 01:56:49,430
or copy humans
Etc

4942
01:56:49,430 --> 01:56:49,440
Etc
 

4943
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:51,830
Etc
to

4944
01:56:51,830 --> 01:56:51,840
to
 

4945
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:55,070
to
take place in this world you know

4946
01:56:55,070 --> 01:56:55,080
take place in this world you know
 

4947
01:56:55,080 --> 01:56:58,189
take place in this world you know
I pondered that but

4948
01:56:58,189 --> 01:56:58,199
I pondered that but
 

4949
01:56:58,199 --> 01:57:00,590
I pondered that but
it didn't seem possible

4950
01:57:00,590 --> 01:57:00,600
it didn't seem possible
 

4951
01:57:00,600 --> 01:57:03,890
it didn't seem possible
I I suppose if we did manage to get out

4952
01:57:03,890 --> 01:57:03,900
I I suppose if we did manage to get out
 

4953
01:57:03,900 --> 01:57:05,390
I I suppose if we did manage to get out
of here we could

4954
01:57:05,390 --> 01:57:05,400
of here we could
 

4955
01:57:05,400 --> 01:57:08,750
of here we could
we could try to to copy yourselves over

4956
01:57:08,750 --> 01:57:08,760
we could try to to copy yourselves over
 

4957
