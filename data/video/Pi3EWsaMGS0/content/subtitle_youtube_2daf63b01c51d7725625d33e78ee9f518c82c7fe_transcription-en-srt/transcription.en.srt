that's okay because uh we could just try
 

483
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,230
that's okay because uh we could just try
again and it'll be the same i guess when

start again from the beginning that it
 

489

together
 

661
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,830
together
which will now disappear and become a

662
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:17,840
which will now disappear and become a
 

663
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,789
which will now disappear and become a
no-brainer

00:19:20,789 --> 00:19:20,799

 

665
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,990

00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:24,000
oh yeah it's mixing the concoction we
 

667
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,669
oh yeah it's mixing the concoction we
gotta make a concoction here i think

668
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:27,679
gotta make a concoction here i think
 

669
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,950
gotta make a concoction here i think
what's in concoction

670
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:30,960
what's in concoction
 

671
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,510
what's in concoction
oh god this looks complicated

672
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:35,520

 

673
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,470

890
00:24:33,669 --> 00:24:33,679
one is orange and one is green
 

891
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,590
one is orange and one is green
does that say anything to you

892
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:37,600

 

893
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,310

no

894
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:40,320

 

895
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,190

okay

896
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:41,200
okay
 

897
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:53,269
okay
good um

898
00:24:53,269 --> 00:24:53,279

 

899
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:57,190

that necessary

900
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:57,200

 

901
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:07,590

don't think so

902
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:07,600

 

903
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,630

so what is the point of this okay

904
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:10,640
so what is the point of this okay
 

905
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,549
so what is the point of this okay
like this then no

906
00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:12,559
like this then no
 

907
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:18,149
like this then no
okay so this one

908
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:18,159

 

909
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,470

do you

910
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:20,480
do you
 

911
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,909
do you
did you just change something over there

912
00:25:23,909 --> 00:25:23,919
did you just change something over there
 

913
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,830
did you just change something over there
uh copy that i

914
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:26,840
uh copy that i
 

915
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,029
uh copy that i
did i wanna

916
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:29,039
did i wanna
 

917
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,870
did i wanna
i think i need the triple connector here

918
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:30,880
i think i need the triple connector here
 

919
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,110
i think i need the triple connector here
but the triple connector

920
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:33,120
but the triple connector
 

921
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,269
but the triple connector
uh so it's coming

922
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:35,279
uh so it's coming
 

923
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,669
uh so it's coming
where is this coming from anyways

924
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:37,679
where is this coming from anyways
 

925
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,990
where is this coming from anyways
oh it's coming from the bottom

926
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:40,000
oh it's coming from the bottom
 

927
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,870
oh it's coming from the bottom
okay

928
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:42,880
okay
 

929
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,390
okay
i guess

930
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:44,400
i guess
 

931
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,549
i guess
because what exactly did you change over

932
00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:46,559
because what exactly did you change over
 

933
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:47,510
because what exactly did you change over
there

934
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:47,520
there
 

935
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,070
there
uh i'm messing with the pipes the pipe

936
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:50,080
uh i'm messing with the pipes the pipe
 

937
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,029
uh i'm messing with the pipes the pipe
connectors and i i think this is uh i

938
00:25:53,029 --> 00:25:53,039
connectors and i i think this is uh i
 

939
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,630
connectors and i i think this is uh i
don't know it's like some sort of gas

940
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:54,640
don't know it's like some sort of gas
 

941
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,390
don't know it's like some sort of gas
that i'm trying to ignite within all

942
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:56,400
that i'm trying to ignite within all
 

943
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,510
that i'm trying to ignite within all
these pipes and have different

944
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:57,520
these pipes and have different
 

945
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,710
these pipes and have different
connectors so i'm just trying to make

946
00:25:58,710 --> 00:25:58,720
connectors so i'm just trying to make
 

947
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:04,310
connectors so i'm just trying to make
sure that it's working

948
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:04,320

 

949
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,950

and so each of these is lit except for

950
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:06,960
and so each of these is lit except for
 

951
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,710
and so each of these is lit except for
this middle one and this middle one is

952
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:08,720
this middle one and this middle one is
 

953
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,149
this middle one and this middle one is
the top one which means i need a three

954
00:26:10,149 --> 00:26:10,159
the top one which means i need a three
 

955
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:11,909
the top one which means i need a three
piece connector so maybe or maybe i'll

956
00:26:11,909 --> 00:26:11,919
piece connector so maybe or maybe i'll
 

957
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:18,710
piece connector so maybe or maybe i'll
just put maybe just put this one

958
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:18,720

 

959
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,710

okay well all of these are lit

960
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:22,720

 

961
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,830

and now

962
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:23,840
and now
 

963
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,830
and now
i don't have any input from this so i

964
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:25,840
i don't have any input from this so i
 

965
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,950
i don't have any input from this so i
don't know

966
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:26,960
don't know
 

967
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,750

ah because it's coming up from this one
 

977
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,870
ah because it's coming up from this one
by itself

978
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:52,880
by itself
 

979
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,870
by itself

real like i see like the general color
of the gas is now

1042
00:29:06,149 --> 00:29:06,159
of the gas is now
 

1043
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,070
of the gas is now
orange

1044
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:08,080
orange
 

1045
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,909

not red
 

1047
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,029
not red
and i try i'm trying to connect it

1048
00:29:13,029 --> 00:29:13,039
and i try i'm trying to connect it
 

1049
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,669
and i try i'm trying to connect it
that's that uh it goes to the the

1050
00:29:15,669 --> 00:29:15,679
that's that uh it goes to the the
 

1051
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,750
that's that uh it goes to the the
barrels because like the tubes the pipes

1052
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:17,760
barrels because like the tubes the pipes
 

1053
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,909
barrels because like the tubes the pipes
they are kind of connected to the

1054
00:29:19,909 --> 00:29:19,919
they are kind of connected to the
 

1055
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,350
they are kind of connected to the
barrels

1056
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:21,360
barrels
 

1057
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,630
barrels
and

1058
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:22,640
and
 

1059
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,669
and
but

1060
00:29:23,669 --> 00:29:23,679
but
 

1061
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,110
but
yeah i think i have to try around a

1062
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:25,120
yeah i think i have to try around a
 

1063
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,269
yeah i think i have to try around a
little bit to make it

1064
00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:27,279
little bit to make it
 

1065
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,149
little bit to make it
connect properly i guess

1066
00:29:30,149 --> 00:29:30,159
connect properly i guess
 

1067
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:30,510
connect properly i guess
okay

1068
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:30,520

1263
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:07,030

i'm just gonna leave the pipes alone

1264
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:07,040

 

1265
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,430

00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:16,550
okay let's go try and put the juice in
the thingy

1268
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:16,560

 

1269
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,910

maybe

1270
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:17,920
maybe
 

1271
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,270
maybe
maybe it's

1272
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:19,280
maybe it's
 

1273
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,950
maybe it's
um

1274
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:22,960

 

1275
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,950

maybe this one

1276
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:24,960
maybe this one
 

1277
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,750
maybe this one
oh no that just goes upwards

1278
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:27,760
oh no that just goes upwards
 

1279
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,710
oh no that just goes upwards
like that that goes nowhere

1280
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:30,720
like that that goes nowhere
 

1281
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,589
like that that goes nowhere
no it has to be the straight one

1282
00:36:33,589 --> 00:36:33,599
no it has to be the straight one
 

1283
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:36,790
no it has to be the straight one
i conclude it has to be a straight one

1284
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:36,800
i conclude it has to be a straight one
 

1285
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,069
i conclude it has to be a straight one
um

1286
00:36:38,069 --> 00:36:38,079
um
 

1287
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:39,750
um
but this one is maybe now but there's

1288
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:39,760
but this one is maybe now but there's
 

1289
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,190
but this one is maybe now but there's
frame coming out and here

1290
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:43,200
frame coming out and here
 

1291
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,069
frame coming out and here
there is one coming out this is two

1292
00:36:46,069 --> 00:36:46,079
there is one coming out this is two
 

1293
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,030
there is one coming out this is two
coming up

1294
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:49,040

 

1295
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,710

what if

1296
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:50,720
what if
 

1297
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,069
what if
put this

1298
00:36:52,069 --> 00:36:52,079
put this
 

1299
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:53,750
put this
like this

1300
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:53,760
like this
 

1301
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,349
like this
so

1302
00:36:55,349 --> 00:36:55,359
so
 

1303
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:58,730
so
blue goes that way

1304
00:36:58,730 --> 00:36:58,740
blue goes that way
 

1305
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:02,870
blue goes that way

1307
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,310
[Music]
no no

1308
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:06,320

 

1309
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,710

and trying to

1310
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:08,720
and trying to
 

1311
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,710
and trying to
recombine it so it's purple again but in

1312
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:12,720
recombine it so it's purple again but in
 

1313
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,230
recombine it so it's purple again but in
a different way because i think the

1314
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:14,240
a different way because i think the
 

1315
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:24,710
a different way because i think the
first way was not correct

1316
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:24,720

 

1317
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,589

that's just like a mixer

1318
00:37:27,589 --> 00:37:27,599
that's just like a mixer
 

1319
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,349
that's just like a mixer
so we have the recipe

1320
00:37:29,349 --> 00:37:29,359
so we have the recipe
 

1321
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:31,670
so we have the recipe
we have this canister we have some pipes

1322
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:31,680
we have this canister we have some pipes
 

1323
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,670
we have this canister we have some pipes
now i suspect this uh thingy up here

1324
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:35,680
now i suspect this uh thingy up here
 

1325
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,030
now i suspect this uh thingy up here
i suspect this thing appears um

1326
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:39,040
i suspect this thing appears um
 

1327
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:45,190
i suspect this thing appears um
to kind of control the pipes maybe

1328
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:45,200

 

1329
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:50,950

these ladder symbols confuse me

1330
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:50,960

 

1331
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,390

but when i was messing around with this

barrels and pipes
three

1352
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:21,760
three
 

1353
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,430

currently creating a purple flame
 

1361
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,670
currently creating a purple flame
uh that should

1362
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:33,680
uh that should
 

1363
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,510

1365
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,550

yeah that it should go it should connect

1366
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:40,560
yeah that it should go it should connect
 

1367
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,150
yeah that it should go it should connect
to the barrel and then fill it up i

1368
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:42,160
to the barrel and then fill it up i
 

1369
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,910
to the barrel and then fill it up i
suppose but

1370
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:43,920
suppose but
 

1371
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,390
suppose but
uh i have i have a leak somewhere i

1372
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:46,400
uh i have i have a leak somewhere i
 

1373
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,790
uh i have i have a leak somewhere i
think

1374
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:48,800

 

1375
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,630

okay do you think the leak could be on

1376
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:50,640
okay do you think the leak could be on
 

1377
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,790
okay do you think the leak could be on
my end since i also can see the pipe so

1378
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:52,800
my end since i also can see the pipe so
 

1379
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,870
my end since i also can see the pipe so
maybe like it's supposed to

1380
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:54,880
maybe like it's supposed to
 

1381
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,910
maybe like it's supposed to
yeah maybe i have a leak at number one

1382
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:57,920
yeah maybe i have a leak at number one
 

1383
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,829
yeah maybe i have a leak at number one
i

1384
00:38:58,829 --> 00:38:58,839
i
 

1385
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:03,829

said i have them as well they're on

1454
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:23,520
said i have them as well they're on
 

1455
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,270
said i have them as well they're on
on below and on top of um big big big

1456
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:27,280
on below and on top of um big big big
 

1457
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,390
on below and on top of um big big big
pipes

1458
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:28,400
pipes
 

1459
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,710
pipes
and then i have single pieces of pipes

1460
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:30,720
and then i have single pieces of pipes
 

1461
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,790
and then i have single pieces of pipes
which with which i can connect the pipes

1462
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:32,800
which with which i can connect the pipes
 

1463
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,550
which with which i can connect the pipes
and there's like gas coming out of the

1464
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:34,560
and there's like gas coming out of the
 

1465
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,910
and there's like gas coming out of the
pipes

1466
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:35,920
pipes
 

1467
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,630
pipes
um and i can turn the pipes

1468
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:38,640
um and i can turn the pipes
 

1469
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,670
um and i can turn the pipes
so that

1470
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:39,680
so that
 

1471
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,950
so that
pipes get connected in in the right way

1472
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:42,960
pipes get connected in in the right way
 

1473
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,950
pipes get connected in in the right way
i guess

1474
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:44,960
i guess
 

1475
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,190
i guess
and uh

1476
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:47,200
and uh
 

1477
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,470
and uh
then

1478
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:48,480
then
 

1479
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,710
then
in some way at some point they should

1480
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:50,720
in some way at some point they should
 

1481
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,550
in some way at some point they should
lead up to the barrels and fill the

1482
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:52,560
lead up to the barrels and fill the
 

1483
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,710
lead up to the barrels and fill the
barrels up

1490
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:02,000
okay so can we confirm like if we fill
 

1491
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,230
okay so can we confirm like if we fill
it with a certain color like if we

1492
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:04,240
it with a certain color like if we
 

1493
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,710
it with a certain color like if we
um contain all the leeks if it uh fills

1494
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:06,720
um contain all the leeks if it uh fills
 

1495
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,230
um contain all the leeks if it uh fills
the barrel with like a certain color

the barrel with like a certain color
 

1497
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,829
the barrel with like a certain color
liquid so that we can test because i

1498
00:42:09,829 --> 00:42:09,839
liquid so that we can test because i
 

1499
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:15,510
liquid so that we can test because i
have juice on my side

1500
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:15,520

 

1501
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,990

like what is this
this needs to be unlocked

1846
00:50:59,430 --> 00:50:59,440
this needs to be unlocked
 

1847
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,430
this needs to be unlocked
and i suspect that

1848
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:01,440
and i suspect that
 

1849
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,190
and i suspect that
it probably has something to do with

1850
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:03,200
it probably has something to do with
 

1851
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,190
it probably has something to do with
this but i it she doesn't have anything

1852
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:05,200
this but i it she doesn't have anything
 

1853
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,630
this but i it she doesn't have anything
to help me with this so i guess it's

1854
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:06,640
to help me with this so i guess it's
 

1855
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,230
to help me with this so i guess it's
something i have to solve myself but i

1933
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,470

ah do you have any other piece that you

1934
00:52:58,470 --> 00:52:58,480
ah do you have any other piece that you
 

1935
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:02,790
ah do you have any other piece that you
can put into the the last six seven

1936
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:02,800
can put into the the last six seven
 

1937
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,390
can put into the the last six seven
connection

1938
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:04,400
connection
 

1939
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,549
connection
yes i got a uh

1940
00:53:06,549 --> 00:53:06,559
yes i got a uh
 

1941
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:08,870
yes i got a uh
i got an l shape two connector or i

1942
00:53:08,870 --> 00:53:08,880
i got an l shape two connector or i
 

1943
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,470
i got an l shape two connector or i
guess the one connector but it's like

1944
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:10,480
guess the one connector but it's like
 

1945
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:11,990
guess the one connector but it's like
you know two ways

1946
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:12,000
you know two ways
 

1947
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,309
you know two ways
uh and then uh one piece

1948
00:53:16,309 --> 00:53:16,319

 

1949
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:18,870

uh yeah put that one one uh way

1950
00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:18,880
uh yeah put that one one uh way
 

1951
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:23,670
uh yeah put that one one uh way
connector in there

1952
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:23,680

 

1953
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:24,950

well there's nothing there's nothing

1954
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:24,960
well there's nothing there's nothing
 

1955
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,430
well there's nothing there's nothing
coming out of uh

1956
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:27,440
coming out of uh
 

1957
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,030
coming out of uh
of this one

1958
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:29,040
of this one
 

1959
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,950
of this one
of the there's not there's no flame at

1960
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:30,960
of the there's not there's no flame at
 

1961
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:34,470
of the there's not there's no flame at
four five six to seven

1962
00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:34,480
four five six to seven
 

1963
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,349
four five six to seven
oh okay then i think

1964
00:53:37,349 --> 00:53:37,359
oh okay then i think
 

1965
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:39,589
oh okay then i think
you will need to put

1966
00:53:39,589 --> 00:53:39,599
you will need to put
 

1967
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:41,349
you will need to put
any piece

1968
00:53:41,349 --> 00:53:41,359
any piece
 

1969
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:44,309
any piece
and four

1970
00:53:44,309 --> 00:53:44,319

 

1971
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:46,309

i can only put

1972
00:53:46,309 --> 00:53:46,319
i can only put
 

1973
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:48,630
i can only put
the pieces between six and seven at

1974
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:48,640
the pieces between six and seven at
 

1975
00:53:48,640 --> 00:54:00,630
the pieces between six and seven at
three and at one

1976
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:00,640

 

1977
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,230

i don't know why it's like that is it

1978
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:02,240
i don't know why it's like that is it
 

1979
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,470
i don't know why it's like that is it
because there's no flame here do you do

1980
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:04,480
because there's no flame here do you do
 

1981
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:08,710
because there's no flame here do you do
you have leaks anywhere

1982
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:08,720

 

1983
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,470

like nickly no

1984
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:10,480
like nickly no
 

1985
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,710
like nickly no
but i am missing a flame at number one

1986
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:12,720
but i am missing a flame at number one
 

1987
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,150
but i am missing a flame at number one
because i put the third piece connector

1988
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:14,160
because i put the third piece connector
 

1989
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,069
because i put the third piece connector
instead of the four piece connector oh i

1990
00:54:16,069 --> 00:54:16,079
instead of the four piece connector oh i
 

1991
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:17,430
instead of the four piece connector oh i
do have a leak actually hold on i'm

1992
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:17,440
do have a leak actually hold on i'm
 

1993
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,470
do have a leak actually hold on i'm
gonna just i'll fix it on mine

1994
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:20,480
gonna just i'll fix it on mine
 

1995
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:24,710
gonna just i'll fix it on mine
okay i think i already had it like uh

1996
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:24,720
okay i think i already had it like uh
 

1997
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,589
okay i think i already had it like uh
i don't know because uh

1998
00:54:27,589 --> 00:54:27,599
i don't know because uh
 

1999
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:30,630
i don't know because uh
this one that uh okay all right so my

2000
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:30,640
this one that uh okay all right so my
 

2001
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,870
this one that uh okay all right so my
red is coming in through one side let's

2002
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:32,880
red is coming in through one side let's
 

2003
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,630
red is coming in through one side let's
put a

2004
00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:34,640
put a
 

2005
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,309
put a
you think this one needs a four piece

2006
00:54:36,309 --> 00:54:36,319
you think this one needs a four piece
 

2007
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:40,230
you think this one needs a four piece
connector

2008
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:40,240

 

2009
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,069

there now we have red going through

2010
00:54:42,069 --> 00:54:42,079
there now we have red going through
 

2011
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:43,430
there now we have red going through
every single one

2012
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:43,440
every single one
 

2013
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,349
every single one
and then blue comes in from two there's

2014
00:54:45,349 --> 00:54:45,359
and then blue comes in from two there's
 

2015
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:54,390
and then blue comes in from two there's
a three piece so we'll put it in here

2016
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:54,400

 

2017
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,390

now it's purple how come there's no

2018
00:54:56,390 --> 00:54:56,400
now it's purple how come there's no
 

2019
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,910
now it's purple how come there's no
coming in from here

2020
00:54:59,910 --> 00:54:59,920

 

2021
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:06,069

where's this coming from anyways

2022
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:06,079

 

2023
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:08,630

uh so i no longer have any leaks from

2024
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:08,640
uh so i no longer have any leaks from
 

2025
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,870
uh so i no longer have any leaks from
one to three and i now have flames

2026
00:55:10,870 --> 00:55:10,880
one to three and i now have flames
 

2027
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,950
one to three and i now have flames
coming in from four to seven they just

2028
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:12,960
coming in from four to seven they just
 

2029
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,630
coming in from four to seven they just
disappeared probably based off something

2030
00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:14,640
disappeared probably based off something
 

2031
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,069
disappeared probably based off something
you did

2032
00:55:16,069 --> 00:55:16,079
you did
 

2033
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:33,430
you did
yeah yeah probably

2034
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:33,440

 

2035
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,470

um

2036
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:34,480
um
 

2037
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,630
um
so now i have the same leak as i have

2038
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:36,640
so now i have the same leak as i have
 

2039
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,470
so now i have the same leak as i have
before but i

2040
00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:38,480
before but i
 

2041
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:39,990
before but i
i'm not sure if that is actually a

2042
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:40,000
i'm not sure if that is actually a
 

2043
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,030
i'm not sure if that is actually a
problem

2044
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:43,040

 

2045
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,789

yeah uh

2046
00:55:44,789 --> 00:55:44,799
yeah uh
 

2047
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:47,030
yeah uh
let's let's let's see what else you have

2048
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:47,040
let's let's let's see what else you have
 

2049
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,710
let's let's let's see what else you have
like uh everywhere maybe there's

2050
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:48,720
like uh everywhere maybe there's
 

2051
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,829
like uh everywhere maybe there's
something else you're missing

2052
00:55:51,829 --> 00:55:51,839
something else you're missing
 

2053
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:53,990
something else you're missing
yeah now now it's back to only blue

2054
00:55:53,990 --> 00:55:54,000
yeah now now it's back to only blue
 

2055
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,549
yeah now now it's back to only blue
color i think you removed the red one

2056
00:55:56,549 --> 00:55:56,559
color i think you removed the red one
 

2057
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:59,349
color i think you removed the red one
yes

2058
00:55:59,349 --> 00:55:59,359

 

2059
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:02,390

um

2060
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:02,400

 

2061
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,430

do you have like any sort of map or like

2062
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:05,440
do you have like any sort of map or like
 

2063
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,910
do you have like any sort of map or like
uh some sort of symbol somewhere because

2064
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:07,920
uh some sort of symbol somewhere because
 

2065
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,430
uh some sort of symbol somewhere because
i have this piece that i think is

2066
00:56:09,430 --> 00:56:09,440
i have this piece that i think is
 

2067
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,510
i have this piece that i think is
important with the gears and stuff and

2068
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:11,520
important with the gears and stuff and
 

2069
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:12,150
important with the gears and stuff and
i'm

2070
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:12,160
i'm
 

2071
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:18,549
i'm
not sure what to do with it

2072
00:56:18,549 --> 00:56:18,559

 

2073
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:20,549

is it what does it look like only gear

2074
00:56:20,549 --> 00:56:20,559
is it what does it look like only gear
 

2075
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:22,069
is it what does it look like only gear
is on it or

2076
00:56:22,069 --> 00:56:22,079
is on it or
 

2077
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:24,470
is on it or
uh so it's kind of like a it's a it's a

2078
00:56:24,470 --> 00:56:24,480
uh so it's kind of like a it's a it's a
 

2079
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:27,030
uh so it's kind of like a it's a it's a
hexagon and it has

2080
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:27,040
hexagon and it has
 

2081
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,230
hexagon and it has
um

2082
00:56:28,230 --> 00:56:28,240
um
 

2083
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,710
um
different

2084
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:30,720
different
 

2085
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,589
different
uh circles connected with dots where

2086
00:56:33,589 --> 00:56:33,599
uh circles connected with dots where
 

2087
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:36,630
uh circles connected with dots where
within the circles and dots oh sorry uh

2088
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:36,640
within the circles and dots oh sorry uh
 

2089
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,950
within the circles and dots oh sorry uh
different dots connected between each

2090
00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:38,960
different dots connected between each
 

2091
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,270
different dots connected between each
other and in those connections i can

2092
00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:41,280
other and in those connections i can
 

2093
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,710
other and in those connections i can
move gears

2094
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:42,720
move gears
 

2095
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:43,510
move gears
uh

2096
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:43,520

2297
01:03:14,799 --> 01:03:16,470

but the four piece connecting the last

01:03:16,470 --> 01:03:16,480
but the four piece connecting the last
 

2299
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:20,710
but the four piece connecting the last
one oh no never mind that ignore me

2300
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:20,720
one oh no never mind that ignore me
 

2301

01:03:38,150 --> 01:03:38,160

 

2303
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:45,190

i currently do not have any leaks

2304
01:03:45,190 --> 01:03:45,200

 

2305
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:56,020

looks good on my end

2306
01:03:56,020 --> 01:03:56,030

everything on my end looks good the

2310
01:04:05,829 --> 01:04:05,839
everything on my end looks good the
 

2311
01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:08,069
everything on my end looks good the
colors are mixed and also there's no

2312
01:04:08,069 --> 01:04:08,079
colors are mixed and also there's no
 

2313
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:10,549

2315
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:12,950

yeah the colors are definitely good but

2316
01:04:12,950 --> 01:04:12,960
yeah the colors are definitely good but
 

2317
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:15,270
yeah the colors are definitely good but
now i have a

2318
01:04:15,270 --> 01:04:15,280
now i have a
 

2319
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:16,870
now i have a
a connection that

2320
01:04:16,870 --> 01:04:16,880
a connection that
 

2321
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:19,270
a connection that
is not working i will i will i will

2322
01:04:19,270 --> 01:04:19,280
is not working i will i will i will
 

2323
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:25,430
is not working i will i will i will
test around something

2324
01:04:25,430 --> 01:04:25,440

 

2325
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,270

we just have to make it so that neither

2326
01:04:27,270 --> 01:04:27,280
we just have to make it so that neither
 

2327
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:30,069
we just have to make it so that neither
of the sides have a leak i guess

2328
01:04:30,069 --> 01:04:30,079
of the sides have a leak i guess
 

2329
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:37,750
of the sides have a leak i guess
that's that changed

2330
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:37,760

 

2331
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:38,829

01:04:38,839 --> 01:04:40,390
all
right

2334
01:04:40,390 --> 01:04:40,400
right
 

2335
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:43,990
right

this is coming in from there

2338
01:04:48,789 --> 01:04:48,799

 

2339
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:59,430

oh

01:04:59,430 --> 01:04:59,440

 

2341
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:00,870

i guess technically speaking i don't

2342
01:05:00,870 --> 01:05:00,880
i guess technically speaking i don't
 

2343
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:02,789
i guess technically speaking i don't
need the four piece here like if i had

2344
01:05:02,789 --> 01:05:02,799
need the four piece here like if i had
 

2345
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:04,390
need the four piece here like if i had
the three piece

2346
01:05:04,390 --> 01:05:04,400
the three piece
 

2347
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,910
the three piece
i can't even scroll through my pipes

2348
01:05:05,910 --> 01:05:05,920
i can't even scroll through my pipes
 

2349
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:11,670
i can't even scroll through my pipes
this is

01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:13,270

um

2352
01:05:13,270 --> 01:05:13,280
um
 

2353
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:15,109
um
maybe we should start from the beginning

2354
01:05:15,109 --> 01:05:15,119
maybe we should start from the beginning
 

2355
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:18,950
maybe we should start from the beginning
oh hold on i'm messing around with it

2356
01:05:18,950 --> 01:05:18,960
oh hold on i'm messing around with it
 

2357
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:20,630
oh hold on i'm messing around with it
i think what it is like obviously

2358
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:20,640
i think what it is like obviously
 

2359
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:22,230
i think what it is like obviously
whatever you're changing also changes

2360
01:05:22,230 --> 01:05:22,240
whatever you're changing also changes
 

2361
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:24,470
whatever you're changing also changes
the direction of my pipe so we just have

2362
01:05:24,470 --> 01:05:24,480
the direction of my pipe so we just have
 

2363
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:26,150
the direction of my pipe so we just have
to figure out the way

2364
01:05:26,150 --> 01:05:26,160
to figure out the way
 

2365
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:37,190
to figure out the way
um where neither of us have any leaks

2366
01:05:37,190 --> 01:05:37,200

 

2367
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:44,150

all right um

2368
01:05:44,150 --> 01:05:44,160

 

2369
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:46,630

can we start from the beginning

2370
01:05:46,630 --> 01:05:46,640
can we start from the beginning
 

2371
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:49,349
can we start from the beginning
all right

2372
01:05:49,349 --> 01:05:49,359

 

2373
01:05:49,359 --> 01:05:52,789

um let's just go to the first pipe

2374
01:05:52,789 --> 01:05:52,799
um let's just go to the first pipe
 

2375
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:55,190
um let's just go to the first pipe
copy that

2376
01:05:55,190 --> 01:05:55,200
copy that
 

2377
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:58,390
copy that
let's do one pipe at a time so i think

2378
01:05:58,390 --> 01:05:58,400
let's do one pipe at a time so i think
 

2379
01:05:58,400 --> 01:05:59,990
let's do one pipe at a time so i think
the first one i'm putting

2380
01:05:59,990 --> 01:06:00,000
the first one i'm putting
 

2381
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,150
the first one i'm putting
actually has to be correct

2382
01:06:02,150 --> 01:06:02,160
actually has to be correct
 

2383
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:04,390
actually has to be correct
so i just sent blue over to the next

2384
01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:04,400
so i just sent blue over to the next
 

2385
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,710
so i just sent blue over to the next
pipe

2386
01:06:06,710 --> 01:06:06,720

2387
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:07,180

i guess
what are your options here

2394
01:06:12,630 --> 01:06:12,640
what are your options here
 

2395
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:14,230
what are your options here
and the

2396
01:06:14,230 --> 01:06:14,240
and the
 

2397
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:15,270

right so i have red coming in from the
 

2401
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:19,029
right so i have red coming in from the
left connector which can be connected to

2402
01:06:19,029 --> 01:06:19,039
left connector which can be connected to
 

2403
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:21,910
left connector which can be connected to
the three other connectors and uh at the

2404
01:06:21,910 --> 01:06:21,920
the three other connectors and uh at the
 

2405
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:24,549
the three other connectors and uh at the
bottom connector it would ignite one

2406
01:06:24,549 --> 01:06:24,559
bottom connector it would ignite one
 

2407
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:27,109
bottom connector it would ignite one
flame at the top connector it ignites

2408
01:06:27,109 --> 01:06:27,119
flame at the top connector it ignites
 

2409
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:29,190
flame at the top connector it ignites
two flames but it still comes out on the

01:06:29,190 --> 01:06:29,200
two flames but it still comes out on the
 

2411
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:30,630
two flames but it still comes out on the
right connector

2412
01:06:30,630 --> 01:06:30,640
right connector
 

2413
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:39,109

what where are you placing them okay um
 

3187
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:22,229
what where are you placing them okay um
i just connected red to yellow which was

3188
01:31:22,229 --> 01:31:22,239
i just connected red to yellow which was
 

3189
01:31:22,239 --> 01:31:26,550
i just connected red to yellow which was
a red exit flame 192 number one which uh

3190
01:31:26,550 --> 01:31:26,560
a red exit flame 192 number one which uh
 

3191
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:29,350
a red exit flame 192 number one which uh
seemed to turn your flame orange

3192
01:31:29,350 --> 01:31:29,360
seemed to turn your flame orange
 

3193
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:31,110
seemed to turn your flame orange
at the moment there's nothing else

3194
01:31:31,110 --> 01:31:31,120
at the moment there's nothing else
 

3195
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:35,910
at the moment there's nothing else
coming out of anywhere else

3196
01:31:35,910 --> 01:31:35,920

 

3197
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:41,669

okay

3199
01:31:41,679 --> 01:31:44,470

where where does it

3200
01:31:44,470 --> 01:31:44,480
where where does it
 

3201
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:45,990
where where does it
um

3202
01:31:45,990 --> 01:31:46,000
um
 

3203
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:51,110
um
where does it stop for you now

3204
01:31:51,110 --> 01:31:51,120

 

3205
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:54,470

um all i have from you is um yellow

3206
01:31:54,470 --> 01:31:54,480
um all i have from you is um yellow
 

3207
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:58,070
um all i have from you is um yellow
coming from number one

3208
01:31:58,070 --> 01:31:58,080
coming from number one
 

3209
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:00,950
coming from number one
uh i also have some coming out of six

3210
01:32:00,950 --> 01:32:00,960
uh i also have some coming out of six
 

3211
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:03,270
uh i also have some coming out of six
and seven

3212
01:32:03,270 --> 01:32:03,280
and seven
 

3213
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:09,590
and seven
okay can you connect that somehow

3214
01:32:09,590 --> 01:32:09,600

 

3215
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:10,470

now

3216
01:32:10,470 --> 01:32:10,480
now
 

3217
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:12,950
now
um i have flames that are going to four

3218
01:32:12,950 --> 01:32:12,960
um i have flames that are going to four
 

3219
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:14,550
um i have flames that are going to four
and five and i have one coming out of

3220
01:32:14,550 --> 01:32:14,560
and five and i have one coming out of
 

3221
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:16,950
and five and i have one coming out of
three that i can connect to two if you'd

3222
01:32:16,950 --> 01:32:16,960
three that i can connect to two if you'd
 

3223
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:21,270
three that i can connect to two if you'd
like

3224
01:32:21,270 --> 01:32:21,280

 

3225
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:22,170

um

3226
01:32:22,170 --> 01:32:22,180

i'll test it out

3230
01:32:35,830 --> 01:32:35,840

 

3231
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:38,629

how's the pressure

3232
01:32:38,629 --> 01:32:38,639
how's the pressure
 

3233
01:32:38,639 --> 01:32:39,430
how's the pressure
uh

3234
01:32:39,430 --> 01:32:39,440
uh
 

3235
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:42,470
uh
it's like a tiny bit above middle

3236
01:32:42,470 --> 01:32:42,480
it's like a tiny bit above middle
 

3237
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:44,550
it's like a tiny bit above middle
oh and i think

3238
01:32:44,550 --> 01:32:44,560
oh and i think
 

3239
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:46,229
oh and i think
uh the two

3240
01:32:46,229 --> 01:32:46,239
uh the two
 

3241
01:32:46,239 --> 01:32:48,709
uh the two
doesn't really lead anywhere for me so

3242
01:32:48,709 --> 01:32:48,719
doesn't really lead anywhere for me so
 

3243
01:32:48,719 --> 01:32:51,110
doesn't really lead anywhere for me so
the two is unnecessary

3244
01:32:51,110 --> 01:32:51,120
the two is unnecessary
 

3245
01:32:51,120 --> 01:33:05,030
the two is unnecessary
yeah yeah

3246
01:33:05,030 --> 01:33:05,040

 

3247
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:08,229

um i put i put the

3248
01:33:08,229 --> 01:33:08,239
um i put i put the
 

3249
01:33:08,239 --> 01:33:10,070
um i put i put the
connector

3250
01:33:10,070 --> 01:33:10,080
connector
 

3251
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:13,750
connector
that sends it to five

3252
01:33:13,750 --> 01:33:13,760
that sends it to five
 

3253
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:16,709
that sends it to five
and six

3254
01:33:16,709 --> 01:33:16,719

 

3255
01:33:16,719 --> 01:33:17,830

and

3256
01:33:17,830 --> 01:33:17,840
and
 

3257
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:22,470
and
uh

3258
01:33:22,470 --> 01:33:22,480

 

3259
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:24,870

now i have almost almost maximum

3260
01:33:24,870 --> 01:33:24,880
now i have almost almost maximum
 

3261
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:26,470
now i have almost almost maximum
pressure

3262
01:33:26,470 --> 01:33:26,480
pressure
 

3263
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:31,110
pressure
okay i do have a leak um

3264
01:33:31,110 --> 01:33:31,120

 

3265
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:32,629

that doesn't help if i set it through

3266
01:33:32,629 --> 01:33:32,639
that doesn't help if i set it through
 

3267
01:33:32,639 --> 01:33:34,550
that doesn't help if i set it through
two because then it uh makes it leak on

3268
01:33:34,550 --> 01:33:34,560
two because then it uh makes it leak on
 

3269
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:37,110
two because then it uh makes it leak on
your side

3270
01:33:37,110 --> 01:33:37,120
your side
 

3271
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:42,229
your side
yes and it's less pressure

3272
01:33:42,229 --> 01:33:42,239

 

3273
01:33:42,239 --> 01:33:46,950

now it's even less now it's more

3274
01:33:46,950 --> 01:33:46,960

 

3275
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:58,880

now it's less pressure

3276
01:33:58,880 --> 01:33:58,890

i think this would have gone a lot

3280
01:34:04,629 --> 01:34:04,639
i think this would have gone a lot
 

3281
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:05,480
i think this would have gone a lot
faster i guess

3282
01:34:05,480 --> 01:34:05,490
faster i guess
 

3283
01:34:05,490 --> 01:34:07,750
faster i guess

the pressure meter
 

3287
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:11,830
the pressure meter
and organized by doing that by looking

and organized by doing that by looking
 

3289
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:15,270

01:34:16,639 --> 01:34:19,510
uh
green is made by

3294
01:34:19,510 --> 01:34:19,520
green is made by
 

3295
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:22,550
green is made by
yellow and blue

3296
01:34:22,550 --> 01:34:22,560

 

3297
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:25,910

3299
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:28,790

so i'm setting blue

3300
01:34:28,790 --> 01:34:28,800
so i'm setting blue
 

3301
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:30,629
so i'm setting blue
um but i don't i don't have yellow

3302
01:34:30,629 --> 01:34:30,639
um but i don't i don't have yellow
 

3303
01:34:30,639 --> 01:34:32,629
um but i don't i don't have yellow
you're the only one who has yellow red

3304
01:34:32,629 --> 01:34:32,639
you're the only one who has yellow red
 

3305
01:34:32,639 --> 01:34:39,430
you're the only one who has yellow red
now

3306
01:34:39,430 --> 01:34:39,440

 

3307
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:58,550

can she send blues for the other ones

3308
01:34:58,550 --> 01:34:58,560

 

3309
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:00,470

you can send uh

3310
01:35:00,470 --> 01:35:00,480
you can send uh
 

3311
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:04,550
you can send uh
yellow as well

3312
01:35:04,550 --> 01:35:04,560

 

3313
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:09,189

um i guess if i send it through two

3314
01:35:09,189 --> 01:35:09,199

 

3315
01:35:09,199 --> 01:35:10,950

are you are you able to send yellow too

3316
01:35:10,950 --> 01:35:10,960
are you are you able to send yellow too
 

3317
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:12,629
are you are you able to send yellow too
or do you only have red

3318
01:35:12,629 --> 01:35:12,639
or do you only have red
 

3319
01:35:12,639 --> 01:35:15,750
or do you only have red
one second

3320
01:35:15,750 --> 01:35:15,760
one second
 

3321
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:17,510
one second
okay

3322
01:35:17,510 --> 01:35:17,520
okay
 

3323
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:19,430
okay
it's green on my end

3324
01:35:19,430 --> 01:35:19,440
it's green on my end
 

3325
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:21,990
it's green on my end
oh okay whatever you did now

3326
01:35:21,990 --> 01:35:22,000
oh okay whatever you did now
 

3327
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:23,030
oh okay whatever you did now
well

3328

well
 

3329
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:25,109
well
i think it's it needs to stay like that

3330
01:35:25,109 --> 01:35:25,119
i think it's it needs to stay like that
 

3331
01:35:25,119 --> 01:35:29,750
i think it's it needs to stay like that
wait does that mean

3332
01:35:29,750 --> 01:35:29,760

 

3333
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:32,629

okay we're sending we're sending green

3334
01:35:32,629 --> 01:35:32,639
okay we're sending we're sending green
 

3335
01:35:32,639 --> 01:35:41,990
okay we're sending we're sending green
uh to i will send green to number three

3336
01:35:41,990 --> 01:35:42,000

 

3337
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:42,790

yellow now so something that you
 

3397
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:23,510
yellow now so something that you
disconnected now i think

3398
01:37:23,510 --> 01:37:23,520
disconnected now i think
 

3399
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:25,430
disconnected now i think
some at least somewhere yeah now now

01:37:25,430 --> 01:37:25,440
some at least somewhere yeah now now

some at least somewhere yeah now now
it's green again somewhere it has to be

it's green again somewhere it has to be
 

3403
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:29,350
it's green again somewhere it has to be
connected so that my blue and my yellow

3404
01:37:29,350 --> 01:37:29,360
connected so that my blue and my yellow
 

3405
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:30,709
connected so that my blue and my yellow
mixes to

i don't want to disconnect this i mean
 

3443
01:38:47,199 --> 01:38:48,390
i don't want to disconnect this i mean
it should be fine if i just connect it

3444
01:38:48,390 --> 01:38:48,400
it should be fine if i just connect it
 

3445
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:50,629
it should be fine if i just connect it
it's just the pressure i see

good on this because uh

good on this because uh
 

3459
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:15,430
good on this because uh
it should swap

01:41:08,719 --> 01:41:09,990
yellow yeah yeah is there a way to stop
it coming through

3520
01:41:09,990 --> 01:41:10,000
it coming through
 

3521
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,149
it coming through
one somehow

3522
01:41:12,149 --> 01:41:12,159
one somehow
 

3523
01:41:12,159 --> 01:41:21,109
one somehow
really

3524
01:41:21,109 --> 01:41:21,119

 

3525
01:41:21,119 --> 01:41:23,750

i could connect it going to the left um

3526
01:41:23,750 --> 01:41:23,760
i could connect it going to the left um
 

3527
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:28,310
i could connect it going to the left um
does it be less leaks

3528
01:41:28,310 --> 01:41:28,320

 

3529
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:31,590

i guess it's probably impossible

3530
01:41:31,590 --> 01:41:31,600
i guess it's probably impossible
 

3531
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:33,830
i guess it's probably impossible
stop it i'm going oh oh oh sorry

3532
01:41:33,830 --> 01:41:33,840
stop it i'm going oh oh oh sorry
 

3533
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:35,189
stop it i'm going oh oh oh sorry
actually i need to change something

3534
01:41:35,189 --> 01:41:35,199
actually i need to change something
 

3535
01:41:35,199 --> 01:41:36,709
actually i need to change something
because it's definitely not going to

3536
01:41:36,709 --> 01:41:36,719
because it's definitely not going to
 

3537
01:41:36,719 --> 01:41:44,790
because it's definitely not going to
connect to the barrels okay

3538
01:41:44,790 --> 01:41:44,800

 

3539
01:41:44,800 --> 01:42:27,430

i guess it has too

3540
01:42:27,430 --> 01:42:27,440

 

3541
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:29,910

yeah yeah we'll keep it keep it uh like

3542
01:42:29,910 --> 01:42:29,920
yeah yeah we'll keep it keep it uh like
 

3543
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:31,030
yeah yeah we'll keep it keep it uh like
this

3544
01:42:31,030 --> 01:42:31,040
this
 

3545
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:36,709

3547
01:42:36,719 --> 01:42:38,470

it's okay if there's a leak

3548
01:42:38,470 --> 01:42:38,480
it's okay if there's a leak
 

3549
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:43,430
it's okay if there's a leak
one leak

3550
01:42:43,430 --> 01:42:43,440

 

3551
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:47,270

can you stop it coming from freeze

3552
01:42:47,270 --> 01:42:47,280

 

3553
01:42:47,280 --> 01:43:06,050

would have been faster like if we'd
 

3565
01:43:18,239 --> 01:43:21,669
would have been faster like if we'd
known about the pressure thingy

3566
01:43:21,669 --> 01:43:21,679
known about the pressure thingy
 

3567
01:43:21,679 --> 01:43:23,350

okay that could be useful so um i'm

3616
01:44:24,310 --> 01:44:24,320
okay that could be useful so um i'm
 

3617

gonna describe again the thing that i
 

3619
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:27,910
gonna describe again the thing that i
have it's a hexagon

3620
01:44:27,910 --> 01:44:27,920
have it's a hexagon
 

3621
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:30,550
have it's a hexagon
with uh gears inside of it that can be

3622
01:44:30,550 --> 01:44:30,560
with uh gears inside of it that can be
 

3623
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:33,350
with uh gears inside of it that can be
moved uh which are connected in some

3624
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:33,360
moved uh which are connected in some
 

3625
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:41,510
moved uh which are connected in some
places and it has five ladder icons

3626
01:44:41,510 --> 01:44:41,520

 

3627
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:43,350

okay uh

3628
01:44:43,350 --> 01:44:43,360
okay uh
 

3629
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:50,790
okay uh
i am on the ladder right now

3630
01:44:50,790 --> 01:44:50,800

 

3631
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:51,830

uh

3632
01:44:51,830 --> 01:44:51,840
uh
 

3633
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:57,830
uh
what signs do you see

3634
01:44:57,830 --> 01:44:57,840

 

3635
01:44:57,840 --> 01:44:59,350

okay so there's a

3636
01:44:59,350 --> 01:44:59,360
okay so there's a
 

3637
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:01,510
okay so there's a
like a north and it's kind of like a

3638
01:45:01,510 --> 01:45:01,520
like a north and it's kind of like a
 

3639
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:03,350
like a north and it's kind of like a
compass on top of the hexagon like

3640
01:45:03,350 --> 01:45:03,360
compass on top of the hexagon like
 

3641
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:05,669
compass on top of the hexagon like
there's an arrow pointing up with an n

3642
01:45:05,669 --> 01:45:05,679
there's an arrow pointing up with an n
 

3643
01:45:05,679 --> 01:45:08,229
there's an arrow pointing up with an n
inside of it and then uh

3644
01:45:08,229 --> 01:45:08,239
inside of it and then uh
 

3645
01:45:08,239 --> 01:45:09,910
inside of it and then uh
i have a compass too i have a compass

3646
01:45:09,910 --> 01:45:09,920
i have a compass too i have a compass
 

3647
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:10,950
i have a compass too i have a compass
too

3648
01:45:10,950 --> 01:45:10,960
too
 

3649
01:45:10,960 --> 01:45:13,350
too
okay uh and then i have some gears which

3650
01:45:13,350 --> 01:45:13,360
okay uh and then i have some gears which
 

3651
01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:17,030
okay uh and then i have some gears which
are movable inside of the hexagon and

3652
01:45:17,030 --> 01:45:17,040
are movable inside of the hexagon and
 

3653
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:18,310
are movable inside of the hexagon and
it looks like

3654
01:45:18,310 --> 01:45:18,320
it looks like
 

3655
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:19,990
it looks like
so it's a hexagon right so it's got one

3656
01:45:19,990 --> 01:45:20,000
so it's a hexagon right so it's got one
 

3657
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:21,910
so it's a hexagon right so it's got one
two three four it's got six sides this

3658
01:45:21,910 --> 01:45:21,920
two three four it's got six sides this
 

3659
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:24,390
two three four it's got six sides this
might be um parallel to like uh the

3660
01:45:24,390 --> 01:45:24,400
might be um parallel to like uh the
 

3661
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:26,470
might be um parallel to like uh the
shape of your room maybe because there's

3662
01:45:26,470 --> 01:45:26,480
shape of your room maybe because there's
 

3663
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:27,990
shape of your room maybe because there's
ladders in

3664
01:45:27,990 --> 01:45:28,000
ladders in
 

3665
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,709
ladders in
uh two of the north corners

3666
01:45:30,709 --> 01:45:30,719
uh two of the north corners
 

3667
01:45:30,719 --> 01:45:33,590
uh two of the north corners
in um one of the

3668
01:45:33,590 --> 01:45:33,600
in um one of the
 

3669
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:36,390
in um one of the
uh west corners uh down by the south and

3670
01:45:36,390 --> 01:45:36,400
uh west corners uh down by the south and
 

3671
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:42,070
uh west corners uh down by the south and
then one by the east and the bottom

3672
01:45:42,070 --> 01:45:42,080

 

3673
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:45,590

uh

3674
01:45:45,590 --> 01:45:45,600

 

3675
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:49,990

um well i have also six signs

3676
01:45:49,990 --> 01:45:50,000
um well i have also six signs
 

3677
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:53,109
um well i have also six signs
like astronomical signs

3678
01:45:53,109 --> 01:45:53,119
like astronomical signs
 

3679
01:45:53,119 --> 01:45:55,750
like astronomical signs
uh around the compass and also around

3680
01:45:55,750 --> 01:45:55,760
uh around the compass and also around
 

3681
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:57,590
uh around the compass and also around
the whole room i'm in i'm in like a big

3682
01:45:57,590 --> 01:45:57,600
the whole room i'm in i'm in like a big
 

3683
01:45:57,600 --> 01:46:01,750
the whole room i'm in i'm in like a big
hole in the ground with a ladder and

3684
01:46:01,750 --> 01:46:01,760
hole in the ground with a ladder and
 

3685
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:04,550
hole in the ground with a ladder and
the signs are are around the ladder as

3686
01:46:04,550 --> 01:46:04,560
the signs are are around the ladder as
 

3687
01:46:04,560 --> 01:46:06,870
the signs are are around the ladder as
well like for example they're on the

3688
01:46:06,870 --> 01:46:06,880
well like for example they're on the
 

3689
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:09,270
well like for example they're on the
fourth piece of the lava i have like a

3690
01:46:09,270 --> 01:46:09,280
fourth piece of the lava i have like a
 

3691
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:12,070
fourth piece of the lava i have like a

filling up is it like you could climb to
one ladder and then the next ladder and

01:51:17,199 --> 01:51:19,189
like what was it moving three pieces of
ladder and the fourth one was gone the

3888
01:51:19,189 --> 01:51:19,199
ladder and the fourth one was gone the
 

3889
01:51:19,199 --> 01:51:21,830
ladder and the fourth one was gone the
fourth one was the planet that is uh

3890

01:53:21,750 --> 01:53:21,760
and it's like one step away from being
 

3953
01:53:21,760 --> 01:53:25,270
and it's like one step away from being
in front of me a lot of people

the
 

6481
02:53:18,240 --> 02:53:20,630
the
thingy though the the thing comes out of

6482
02:53:20,630 --> 02:53:20,640
thingy though the the thing comes out of
 

6483
02:53:20,640 --> 02:53:21,910
thingy though the the thing comes out of
the clock

the clock
 

6485
02:53:21,920 --> 02:53:25,510
the clock
okay so on my clock i have uh three big

6486
02:53:25,510 --> 02:53:25,520
okay so on my clock i have uh three big
 

6487
02:53:25,520 --> 02:53:28,550
okay so on my clock i have uh three big
circles with a different amount of like

6488
02:53:28,550 --> 02:53:28,560
circles with a different amount of like
 

6489
02:53:28,560 --> 02:53:30,790
circles with a different amount of like
uh strikes on it so i can tell you the

6490
02:53:30,790 --> 02:53:30,800
uh strikes on it so i can tell you the
 

6491
02:53:30,800 --> 02:53:32,790
uh strikes on it so i can tell you the
numbers so like for the first one it's

6492
02:53:32,790 --> 02:53:32,800
numbers so like for the first one it's
 

6493
02:53:32,800 --> 02:53:34,230
numbers so like for the first one it's
four

6494
02:53:34,230 --> 02:53:34,240
four
 

6495
02:53:34,240 --> 02:53:35,910
four
uh as if it were

6496
02:53:35,910 --> 02:53:35,920
uh as if it were
 

6497
02:53:35,920 --> 02:53:39,990
uh as if it were
uh nine ten eleven twelve one

6498
02:53:39,990 --> 02:53:40,000
uh nine ten eleven twelve one
 

6499
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:41,670
uh nine ten eleven twelve one
that makes sense nine ten eleven twelve

6500
02:53:41,670 --> 02:53:41,680
that makes sense nine ten eleven twelve
 

6501
02:53:41,680 --> 02:53:45,269
that makes sense nine ten eleven twelve
one okay that's too much

6502

6503
02:53:45,279 --> 02:53:47,590

uh so i have four strikes where it would

6504
02:53:47,590 --> 02:53:47,600
uh so i have four strikes where it would
 

6505
02:53:47,600 --> 02:53:49,670
uh so i have four strikes where it would
be like 10

6506

7203
03:10:47,279 --> 03:10:48,950
knob came out so i think fast glowing is
better than slow glowing

7204
03:10:48,950 --> 03:10:48,960
better than slow glowing
 

7205
03:10:48,960 --> 03:10:51,110
better than slow glowing
yeah so when i get closer to like the

7206
03:10:51,110 --> 03:10:51,120
yeah so when i get closer to like the
 

7207
03:10:51,120 --> 03:10:53,510
yeah so when i get closer to like the
different crystals around the

03:10:53,510 --> 03:10:53,520
different crystals around the
 

7209
03:10:53,520 --> 03:10:55,990
different crystals around the
area for me it's either fast or slow and

7210
03:10:55,990 --> 03:10:56,000
area for me it's either fast or slow and

area for me it's either fast or slow and
i guess the fastest one is the one i

7212
03:10:57,349 --> 03:10:57,359
i guess the fastest one is the one i
 

7213

i guess the fastest one is the one i
should touch so tell me whenever it's
