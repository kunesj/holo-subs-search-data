4443
01:56:50,520 --> 01:56:52,910
thingy I think that is a treasure there
might be something extra but I program

4451
01:57:01,239 --> 01:57:03,390
spinning I think I don't know how though
because like here is an arrow as well

4452
01:57:03,390 --> 01:57:03,400
because like here is an arrow as well
 

4453
01:57:03,400 --> 01:57:05,189
because like here is an arrow as well
but that Arrow automatically goes up

you said where we like Loop it so he
 

4503
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:22,270
you said where we like Loop it so he
walks over the gold more than once make

4504

treasure okay okay let's use our brain
 

4935
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:52,950
treasure okay okay let's use our brain
power okay okay so we want him to go

power okay okay so we want him to go
here in the middle so he start uh this

4938
02:08:56,990 --> 02:08:57,000
here in the middle so he start uh this
 

4939

should touch all the golden

4960
02:09:29,109 --> 02:09:29,119

 

4961
02:09:29,119 --> 02:09:34,830

ones oh I think it like this

4962
02:09:34,830 --> 02:09:34,840

 

4963
02:09:34,840 --> 02:09:37,669

4967
02:09:39,280 --> 02:09:41,069
don't I don't see how it's possible
because I'm to hit all of them and also

4968
02:09:41,069 --> 02:09:41,079
because I'm to hit all of them and also
 

4969
02:09:41,079 --> 02:09:45,270
because I'm to hit all of them and also
go into the middle

4970
02:09:45,270 --> 02:09:45,280

 

4971
02:09:45,280 --> 02:09:48,109

yeah can't can't do this cuz yeah I

4975
02:09:49,559 --> 02:09:51,589
don't think it's it's I think it's
actually impossible can't change tracks

4976
02:09:51,589 --> 02:09:51,599
actually impossible can't change tracks
 

4977
02:09:51,599 --> 02:09:52,750
actually impossible can't change tracks
while he's

4978
02:09:52,750 --> 02:09:52,760
while he's
 

4979
02:09:52,760 --> 02:09:57,149

now are struggling just does the ding

4982
02:10:00,790 --> 02:10:00,800
now are struggling just does the ding
 

4983
02:10:00,800 --> 02:10:02,910
now are struggling just does the ding
thing for him cuz he's

4984
02:10:02,910 --> 02:10:02,920
thing for him cuz he's
 

4985
02:10:02,920 --> 02:10:05,750
thing for him cuz he's
special he supposed to go into here and

4986
02:10:05,750 --> 02:10:05,760
special he supposed to go into here and
 

4987
02:10:05,760 --> 02:10:07,589
special he supposed to go into here and
somebody goes into here and we just have

4988
02:10:07,589 --> 02:10:07,599
somebody goes into here and we just have
 

4989
02:10:07,599 --> 02:10:11,109
somebody goes into here and we just have
to figure out what it is that it's an

4990
02:10:11,109 --> 02:10:11,119
to figure out what it is that it's an
 

4991
02:10:11,119 --> 02:10:13,390
to figure out what it is that it's an
both of us going into their activates

4992
02:10:13,390 --> 02:10:13,400
both of us going into their activates
 

4993
02:10:13,400 --> 02:10:14,790
both of us going into their activates
what's an I hope it's not a thing where

4994
02:10:14,790 --> 02:10:14,800
what's an I hope it's not a thing where
 

4995
02:10:14,800 --> 02:10:16,549
what's an I hope it's not a thing where
you need more than three

4996
02:10:16,549 --> 02:10:16,559
you need more than three
 

4997
02:10:16,559 --> 02:10:19,750
you need more than three
people no no they said it's everything's

4998
02:10:19,750 --> 02:10:19,760
people no no they said it's everything's
 

4999
02:10:19,760 --> 02:10:22,189
people no no they said it's everything's
doable with just one person

5000
02:10:22,189 --> 02:10:22,199
doable with just one person
 

5001
02:10:22,199 --> 02:10:25,750
doable with just one person
with one yes

5002
02:10:25,750 --> 02:10:25,760
with one yes
 

5003
02:10:25,760 --> 02:10:27,589
with one yes
okay actually I don't know how the

5004
02:10:27,589 --> 02:10:27,599
okay actually I don't know how the
 

5005
02:10:27,599 --> 02:10:28,990
okay actually I don't know how the
puzzle earlier would have been possible

5006
02:10:28,990 --> 02:10:29,000
puzzle earlier would have been possible
 

5007
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:31,709
puzzle earlier would have been possible
but I okay I'm going to reset it so that

5008
02:10:31,709 --> 02:10:31,719
but I okay I'm going to reset it so that
 

5009
02:10:31,719 --> 02:10:35,270
but I okay I'm going to reset it so that
he goes into the far right one about

5010
02:10:35,270 --> 02:10:35,280
he goes into the far right one about
 

5011
02:10:35,280 --> 02:10:38,510
he goes into the far right one about
that one

5012
02:10:38,510 --> 02:10:38,520

 

5013
02:10:38,520 --> 02:10:41,510

though oh wait what was it he goes this

5014
02:10:41,510 --> 02:10:41,520
though oh wait what was it he goes this
 

5015
02:10:41,520 --> 02:10:44,430
though oh wait what was it he goes this
way this is kind of easy who says this

5016
02:10:44,430 --> 02:10:44,440
way this is kind of easy who says this
 

5017
02:10:44,440 --> 02:10:45,750
way this is kind of easy who says this
is

5018
02:10:45,750 --> 02:10:45,760
is
 

5019
02:10:45,760 --> 02:10:48,109
is
easy they think it's easy cuz they don't

5020
02:10:48,109 --> 02:10:48,119
easy they think it's easy cuz they don't
 

5021
02:10:48,119 --> 02:10:52,270
easy they think it's easy cuz they don't
actually get it are they fibbing

5022
02:10:52,270 --> 02:10:52,280
actually get it are they fibbing
 

5023
02:10:52,280 --> 02:10:56,589
actually get it are they fibbing
they're fing are you guys did we try

5024
02:10:56,589 --> 02:10:56,599
they're fing are you guys did we try
 

5025
02:10:56,599 --> 02:10:58,510
they're fing are you guys did we try
standing on this platform while he's

standing on this platform while he's
 

5027
02:10:58,520 --> 02:11:00,430
standing on this platform while he's
standing on that platform have we tried

5028
02:11:00,430 --> 02:11:00,440
standing on that platform have we tried
 

5029
02:11:00,440 --> 02:11:03,149
standing on that platform have we tried
that have someone standing at oh I don't

5030
