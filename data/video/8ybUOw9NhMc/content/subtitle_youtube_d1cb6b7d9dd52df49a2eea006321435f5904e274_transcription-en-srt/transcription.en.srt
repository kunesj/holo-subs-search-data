that is true yeah but the way to do it
 

5133
02:30:02,960 --> 02:30:05,670
that is true yeah but the way to do it
is like you just keep track of like what

5134

is like you just keep track of like what
 

5135
02:30:05,680 --> 02:30:08,309
is like you just keep track of like what
each like when you block what it

5136
02:30:08,309 --> 02:30:08,319
each like when you block what it
 

5137
02:30:08,319 --> 02:30:10,670
each like when you block what it
fills but you just got to be mindful of

5138
02:30:10,670 --> 02:30:10,680
fills but you just got to be mindful of
 

5139
02:30:10,680 --> 02:30:12,150

multiple paths look seems as if there is
 

5545
02:41:58,319 --> 02:42:00,110
multiple paths look seems as if there is
one path and that is marked by the

one path and that is marked by the
 

5547
