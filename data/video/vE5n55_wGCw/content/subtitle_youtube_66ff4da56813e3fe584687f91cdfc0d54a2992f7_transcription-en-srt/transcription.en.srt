of it we can just run for the bloom and
 

2553
01:03:30,359 --> 01:03:32,390

so because apparently this I didn't

2632
01:05:18,410 --> 01:05:18,420
so because apparently this I didn't

01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:19,789
so because apparently this I didn't
notice this because I was also using

notice this because I was also using
 

2635
01:05:19,799 --> 01:05:22,789
notice this because I was also using
bombs but when you kill one you can kill

2636
01:05:22,789 --> 01:05:22,799
bombs but when you kill one you can kill
 

2637
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:25,309
bombs but when you kill one you can kill
them you can you can stun them pretty

2638
01:05:25,309 --> 01:05:25,319
them you can you can stun them pretty
 

2639
01:05:25,319 --> 01:05:28,069
them you can you can stun them pretty
easily if you shoot their their eyes the

2640
01:05:28,069 --> 01:05:28,079
easily if you shoot their their eyes the
 

2641
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:29,690
easily if you shoot their their eyes the
eyes on their hands

2642
01:05:29,690 --> 01:05:29,700
eyes on their hands
 

2643
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:32,510

uh with an arrow but the thing is if you

2644
01:05:32,510 --> 01:05:32,520
uh with an arrow but the thing is if you
 

2645
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:35,089
uh with an arrow but the thing is if you
kill one only one by one then they will

2646
01:05:35,089 --> 01:05:35,099
kill one only one by one then they will
 

2647
01:05:35,099 --> 01:05:37,849
kill one only one by one then they will

the biggest mountain what's the best way
 

2675
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:11,750
the biggest mountain what's the best way
to get there there's like a rail here

2676

to get there there's like a rail here
 

2677
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:14,630

so probably gotta take that one
 

2679
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:17,030
so probably gotta take that one
although there's also from the hot

I don't think it would have really

3036
01:16:40,189 --> 01:16:40,199
I don't think it would have really
 

3037
01:16:40,199 --> 01:16:43,070
I don't think it would have really
been a problem

3038
01:16:43,070 --> 01:16:43,080
been a problem
 

3039
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:48,649
been a problem

3041
01:16:48,659 --> 01:16:50,630

I was thinking you know they need some

3042
01:16:50,630 --> 01:16:50,640
I was thinking you know they need some
 

3043
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:54,290
I was thinking you know they need some
time to really get going

3044
01:16:54,290 --> 01:16:54,300
time to really get going
 

3045
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:56,149
time to really get going
so I thought it would be fine but okay

ah not Sharp
 

3261
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:41,630
ah not Sharp
I thought that was kind of not sharp

3262
01:23:41,630 --> 01:23:41,640
I thought that was kind of not sharp
 

3263
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:48,830
I thought that was kind of not sharp
looking though

3264
01:23:48,830 --> 01:23:48,840

 

3265
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:52,070

overpowered in totk in early game yeah
and

3278
01:24:08,630 --> 01:24:08,640
and
 

3279
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:09,910
and
um I have learned

3280
01:24:09,910 --> 01:24:09,920
um I have learned
 

3281
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:13,490
um I have learned
some ways of doing it not that I will

3282
01:24:13,490 --> 01:24:13,500
some ways of doing it not that I will
 

3283
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:15,590
some ways of doing it not that I will
attempt on doing it but

3284
01:24:15,590 --> 01:24:15,600
attempt on doing it but
 

3285
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:16,550
attempt on doing it but
um

3286
01:24:16,550 --> 01:24:16,560
um
 

3287
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:20,890
um
so there is apparently those lionels

3288
01:24:20,890 --> 01:24:20,900
so there is apparently those lionels
 

3289
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:25,010
so there is apparently those lionels
in the underground too there's like a oh

3290
01:24:25,010 --> 01:24:25,020
in the underground too there's like a oh
 

3291
01:24:25,020 --> 01:24:26,930
in the underground too there's like a oh
a whole

3292
01:24:26,930 --> 01:24:26,940
a whole
 

3293
01:24:26,940 --> 01:24:28,189
a whole
um

3294
01:24:28,189 --> 01:24:28,199
um
 

3295
01:24:28,199 --> 01:24:31,070
um
what's it called

3296
01:24:31,070 --> 01:24:31,080
what's it called
 

3297
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:33,649
what's it called
Arena to fight them in

3298

yeah
 

3301
01:24:35,460 --> 01:24:39,470
yeah
and the materials they give you yo

3302
01:24:39,470 --> 01:24:39,480
and the materials they give you yo
 

3303
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:43,729
and the materials they give you yo
very good for getting overpowered but

3304
01:24:43,729 --> 01:24:43,739
very good for getting overpowered but
 

3305
01:24:43,739 --> 01:24:45,830
very good for getting overpowered but
then what I mean what I've learned what

3306
01:24:45,830 --> 01:24:45,840
then what I mean what I've learned what
 

3307
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:49,370
then what I mean what I've learned what
I what I find very useful for the future

3308
01:24:49,370 --> 01:24:49,380
I what I find very useful for the future
 

3309
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:54,229
I what I find very useful for the future
is that when you combine something some

3310
01:24:54,229 --> 01:24:54,239
is that when you combine something some
 

3311
01:24:54,239 --> 01:24:57,550
is that when you combine something some
material that you know you find

3312
01:24:57,550 --> 01:24:57,560
material that you know you find
 

3313
01:24:57,560 --> 01:25:00,850
material that you know you find
very very very

3314
01:25:00,850 --> 01:25:00,860
very very very
 

3315
01:25:00,860 --> 01:25:03,290
very very very
valuable and you don't really want to

3316
01:25:03,290 --> 01:25:03,300
valuable and you don't really want to
 

3317
01:25:03,300 --> 01:25:05,090
valuable and you don't really want to
lose it

3318
01:25:05,090 --> 01:25:05,100
lose it
 

3319
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:06,729
lose it
Well

3320
01:25:06,729 --> 01:25:06,739
Well
 

3321
01:25:06,739 --> 01:25:08,570
Well
turns out

3322
01:25:08,570 --> 01:25:08,580
turns out
 

3323
01:25:08,580 --> 01:25:11,209
turns out
when it's when a weapon says it's about

3324
01:25:11,209 --> 01:25:11,219
when it's when a weapon says it's about
 

3325
01:25:11,219 --> 01:25:14,270
when it's when a weapon says it's about
to break the best thing to do and I know

3326
01:25:14,270 --> 01:25:14,280
to break the best thing to do and I know
 

3327
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:15,770
to break the best thing to do and I know
that I mean we already could have known

3328
01:25:15,770 --> 01:25:15,780
that I mean we already could have known
 

3329
01:25:15,780 --> 01:25:17,630
that I mean we already could have known
that but

3330
01:25:17,630 --> 01:25:17,640
that but
 

3331
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:19,790
that but
um

3332
01:25:19,790 --> 01:25:19,800

 

3333
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:22,189

before breaking

3334
01:25:22,189 --> 01:25:22,199
before breaking
 

3335
01:25:22,199 --> 01:25:25,010
before breaking
you put it away and then later on I

3336
01:25:25,010 --> 01:25:25,020
you put it away and then later on I
 

3337
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:26,390
you put it away and then later on I
guess you can only do this until later

3338
01:25:26,390 --> 01:25:26,400
guess you can only do this until later
 

3339
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:30,830
guess you can only do this until later
on when you find the pla shooting star

3340
01:25:30,830 --> 01:25:30,840
on when you find the pla shooting star
 

3341
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:33,010
on when you find the pla shooting star
when you find the place

3342
01:25:33,010 --> 01:25:33,020
when you find the place
 

3343
01:25:33,020 --> 01:25:37,070
when you find the place
that can de-attach the materials that

3344
01:25:37,070 --> 01:25:37,080
that can de-attach the materials that
 

3345
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:39,530
that can de-attach the materials that
you attached to the diffused weapons

3346
01:25:39,530 --> 01:25:39,540
you attached to the diffused weapons
 

3347
01:25:39,540 --> 01:25:42,530
you attached to the diffused weapons
then you bring it there and then I would

3348
01:25:42,530 --> 01:25:42,540
then you bring it there and then I would
 

3349
01:25:42,540 --> 01:25:45,229
then you bring it there and then I would
only mostly do that for Lionel stuff or

3350
01:25:45,229 --> 01:25:45,239
only mostly do that for Lionel stuff or
 

3351
01:25:45,239 --> 01:25:47,450
only mostly do that for Lionel stuff or
maybe to construct the real construct

3352
01:25:47,450 --> 01:25:47,460
maybe to construct the real construct
 

3353
01:25:47,460 --> 01:25:51,470
maybe to construct the real construct
the really strong construct things

3354
01:25:51,470 --> 01:25:51,480
the really strong construct things
 

3355
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:54,950
the really strong construct things
is it over there

3356
01:25:54,950 --> 01:25:54,960

 

3357
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:56,689

Terry Town

3358
01:25:56,689 --> 01:25:56,699
Terry Town
 

3359
01:25:56,699 --> 01:25:59,270
Terry Town
um yeah so for that I would do that in

3360
01:25:59,270 --> 01:25:59,280
um yeah so for that I would do that in
 

3361
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:01,250
um yeah so for that I would do that in
the future I think before destroying my

3362
01:26:01,250 --> 01:26:01,260
the future I think before destroying my
 

3363
01:26:01,260 --> 01:26:05,209
the future I think before destroying my
my Lionel uh uh materials I would go

3364
01:26:05,209 --> 01:26:05,219
my Lionel uh uh materials I would go
 

3365
01:26:05,219 --> 01:26:08,110
my Lionel uh uh materials I would go
there

3366
01:26:08,110 --> 01:26:08,120

 

3367
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:11,330

and uh get back or maybe also you have

3368
01:26:11,330 --> 01:26:11,340
and uh get back or maybe also you have
 

3369
01:26:11,340 --> 01:26:14,330
and uh get back or maybe also you have
gemstones on top of uh some weapons yeah

3370
01:26:14,330 --> 01:26:14,340
gemstones on top of uh some weapons yeah
 

3371
01:26:14,340 --> 01:26:16,310
gemstones on top of uh some weapons yeah
yeah

3372
01:26:16,310 --> 01:26:16,320
yeah
 

3373
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:17,990
yeah
I would get that back and use it

3374
01:26:17,990 --> 01:26:18,000
I would get that back and use it
 

3375
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:21,530
I would get that back and use it
endlessly because the weapon that you

3376
01:26:21,530 --> 01:26:21,540
endlessly because the weapon that you
 

3377
01:26:21,540 --> 01:26:25,250
endlessly because the weapon that you
merge it to will be damaged but the

3378
01:26:25,250 --> 01:26:25,260
merge it to will be damaged but the
 

3379
01:26:25,260 --> 01:26:27,290
merge it to will be damaged but the
material is not and you can use them

3380
01:26:27,290 --> 01:26:27,300
material is not and you can use them
 

3381
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:32,510
material is not and you can use them
again and again and again endlessly

3382
01:26:32,510 --> 01:26:32,520

 

3383
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:33,950

yeah

3384
01:26:33,950 --> 01:26:33,960
yeah
 

3385
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:35,709
yeah
breaking them apart

3386
01:26:35,709 --> 01:26:35,719
breaking them apart
 

3387
01:26:35,719 --> 01:26:38,629
breaking them apart
basically kind of low-key repairs the

3388
01:26:38,629 --> 01:26:38,639
basically kind of low-key repairs the
 

3389
01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:40,250
basically kind of low-key repairs the
thing that you've used not the base

3390
01:26:40,250 --> 01:26:40,260
thing that you've used not the base
 

3391
01:26:40,260 --> 01:26:44,030
thing that you've used not the base
thing though okay let's wrap this car

3392
01:26:44,030 --> 01:26:44,040
thing though okay let's wrap this car
 

3393
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:47,390
thing though okay let's wrap this car
look at it I guess we're saying sockets

3394
01:26:47,390 --> 01:26:47,400
look at it I guess we're saying sockets
 

3395
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:49,729
look at it I guess we're saying sockets
to mine cards but let's see how far we

3396
01:26:49,729 --> 01:26:49,739
to mine cards but let's see how far we
 

3397
01:26:49,739 --> 01:26:51,770

6199
02:45:59,040 --> 02:46:02,330
this one that leads to this island ah
and if we stop here we can jump on this

6200
02:46:02,330 --> 02:46:02,340
and if we stop here we can jump on this
 

6201
02:46:02,340 --> 02:46:03,349
and if we stop here we can jump on this
one

6202
02:46:03,349 --> 02:46:03,359
one
 

6203
02:46:03,359 --> 02:46:05,990

I mean
 

6207
02:46:08,460 --> 02:46:11,990
I mean
should work maybe

6208
02:46:11,990 --> 02:46:12,000

 

6209
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:14,870

you had to brute force it why so far I

6210
02:46:14,870 --> 02:46:14,880
you had to brute force it why so far I
 

6211
02:46:14,880 --> 02:46:16,670
you had to brute force it why so far I
cannot relate so far I haven't been

6212
02:46:16,670 --> 02:46:16,680
cannot relate so far I haven't been
 

6213

6223
02:46:32,040 --> 02:46:33,889

we just got off right we don't have to

6224
02:46:33,889 --> 02:46:33,899
we just got off right we don't have to
 

6225
02:46:33,899 --> 02:46:35,510
we just got off right we don't have to
switch anything

6226
02:46:35,510 --> 02:46:35,520
switch anything
 

6227
02:46:35,520 --> 02:46:37,730
switch anything
or

6228
02:46:37,730 --> 02:46:37,740
or
 

6229
02:46:37,740 --> 02:46:46,929
or
wait can we switch right here

6230
02:46:46,929 --> 02:46:46,939

 

6231
02:46:46,939 --> 02:46:49,070

no wait never mind it's fine it's

6232
02:46:49,070 --> 02:46:49,080
no wait never mind it's fine it's
 

6233
02:46:49,080 --> 02:46:53,929
no wait never mind it's fine it's
probably fine

6234
02:46:53,929 --> 02:46:53,939

 

6235
02:46:53,939 --> 02:46:57,610

let me test it

6236
02:46:57,610 --> 02:46:57,620

 

6237
02:46:57,620 --> 02:47:00,110

ah yeah okay

ah yeah okay
 

6239
02:47:00,120 --> 02:47:03,190
ah yeah okay
then we want to take that path okay

6240
02:47:03,190 --> 02:47:03,200
then we want to take that path okay
 

6241
02:47:03,200 --> 02:47:14,389
then we want to take that path okay
we turn it around

6242
02:47:14,389 --> 02:47:14,399

 

6243
02:47:14,399 --> 02:47:17,510

yeah it looks pretty straightforward

6244
02:47:17,510 --> 02:47:17,520
yeah it looks pretty straightforward
 

6245
02:47:17,520 --> 02:47:19,910
yeah it looks pretty straightforward

6281
02:48:29,580 --> 02:48:31,550

well desperate situation is called for

6282
02:48:31,550 --> 02:48:31,560
well desperate situation is called for
 

6283
02:48:31,560 --> 02:48:39,530
well desperate situation is called for
desperate measures right

6284
02:48:39,530 --> 02:48:39,540

 

6285
02:48:39,540 --> 02:48:44,990

is it not gonna work if it's straight

6286
02:48:44,990 --> 02:48:45,000

 

6287
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:49,849

but

6288
02:48:49,849 --> 02:48:49,859

 

6289
02:48:49,859 --> 02:48:51,349

um when you have the momentum to do it

6290
02:48:51,349 --> 02:48:51,359
um when you have the momentum to do it
 

6291
02:48:51,359 --> 02:48:55,429
um when you have the momentum to do it
here yeah

6292
02:48:55,429 --> 02:48:55,439

 

6293
02:48:55,439 --> 02:48:58,070

if you run it works

6294
02:48:58,070 --> 02:48:58,080
if you run it works
 

6295
02:48:58,080 --> 02:49:01,010
if you run it works
okay I thought I was falling down but he

6296
02:49:01,010 --> 02:49:01,020
okay I thought I was falling down but he
 

6297
02:49:01,020 --> 02:49:03,230
okay I thought I was falling down but he
kind of linked into it

6298
02:49:03,230 --> 02:49:03,240
kind of linked into it
 

6299
02:49:03,240 --> 02:49:06,349
kind of linked into it
okay thank God

6300
02:49:06,349 --> 02:49:06,359

 

6301
02:49:06,359 --> 02:49:08,450

don't think I can do an upwards though

6302
02:49:08,450 --> 02:49:08,460
don't think I can do an upwards though
 

6303
02:49:08,460 --> 02:49:10,190
don't think I can do an upwards though
but uh

6304
02:49:10,190 --> 02:49:10,200
but uh
 

6305
02:49:10,200 --> 02:49:12,170
but uh
we'll change the track from a distance

6306
02:49:12,170 --> 02:49:12,180
we'll change the track from a distance
 

6307
02:49:12,180 --> 02:49:14,690
we'll change the track from a distance
because if I do it from too close I

6308
02:49:14,690 --> 02:49:14,700
because if I do it from too close I
 

6309
02:49:14,700 --> 02:49:17,990
because if I do it from too close I
guess it just gets all wobbly and crows

6310
02:49:17,990 --> 02:49:18,000
guess it just gets all wobbly and crows
 

6311
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:24,370
guess it just gets all wobbly and crows
me off

6313
02:49:24,380 --> 02:49:28,790

I think it's possible but

6314
02:49:28,790 --> 02:49:28,800

 

6315
02:49:28,800 --> 02:49:29,870

6316
02:49:29,870 --> 02:49:29,880
um
 

6317
02:49:29,880 --> 02:49:48,429
um
I better not risk it again

6318
02:49:48,429 --> 02:49:48,439

 

6319
02:49:48,439 --> 02:49:51,230

now we go up

6320
02:49:51,230 --> 02:49:51,240
now we go up
 

6321
02:49:51,240 --> 02:49:54,710
now we go up
and when we go up

6322
02:49:54,710 --> 02:49:54,720
and when we go up
 

6323
02:49:54,720 --> 02:49:57,110
and when we go up
we just get off here and then find our

6324
02:49:57,110 --> 02:49:57,120
we just get off here and then find our
 

6325
02:49:57,120 --> 02:49:58,370
we just get off here and then find our
connection

6326
02:49:58,370 --> 02:49:58,380
connection
 

6327
02:49:58,380 --> 02:50:02,330
connection
the one that leads to here okay

6328
02:50:02,330 --> 02:50:02,340

 

6329
02:50:02,340 --> 02:50:05,570

always gonna be aware of where we are

always gonna be aware of where we are
and where we're going and as long as we

6332
02:50:07,250 --> 02:50:07,260
and where we're going and as long as we
 

6333
02:50:07,260 --> 02:50:09,309
and where we're going and as long as we
do that there shouldn't be too

6334
02:50:09,309 --> 02:50:09,319
do that there shouldn't be too
 

6335
02:50:09,319 --> 02:50:11,809

03:01:21,110 --> 03:01:21,120
so but we just went this way so if we go

back
