01:15:03,669 --> 01:15:03,679
like comparable in quality to the last
 

2641
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:05,350
like comparable in quality to the last
one because it's hard to tell really but

2642
01:15:05,350 --> 01:15:05,360
one because it's hard to tell really but
 

2643
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:07,750
one because it's hard to tell really but
it had good reviews I think and and

2644
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:07,760
it had good reviews I think and and
 

2645
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:09,669
it had good reviews I think and and
price-wise you know we had to we had to

2646
01:15:09,669 --> 01:15:09,679
price-wise you know we had to we had to
 

2647
01:15:09,679 --> 01:15:11,110
price-wise you know we had to we had to
go a little bit cheaper this time

2648
01:15:11,110 --> 01:15:11,120
go a little bit cheaper this time
 

2649
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:14,189
go a little bit cheaper this time
because it's 100% on season I checked

2650
01:15:14,189 --> 01:15:14,199
because it's 100% on season I checked
 

2651
01:15:14,199 --> 01:15:17,470
because it's 100% on season I checked
out how much the one costs that I went

2652
01:15:17,470 --> 01:15:17,480
out how much the one costs that I went
 

2653
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:19,709
out how much the one costs that I went
to with waya how much it would cost for

2654
01:15:19,709 --> 01:15:19,719
to with waya how much it would cost for
 

2655
01:15:19,719 --> 01:15:22,229
to with waya how much it would cost for
this season and maybe it's because when

2656
01:15:22,229 --> 01:15:22,239
this season and maybe it's because when
 

2657
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:24,229
this season and maybe it's because when
I looked maybe it was already like fully

2658
01:15:24,229 --> 01:15:24,239
I looked maybe it was already like fully
 

2659
01:15:24,239 --> 01:15:28,950
I looked maybe it was already like fully
booked mostly but the prices were insane

2660
01:15:28,950 --> 01:15:28,960
booked mostly but the prices were insane
 

2661
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:32,660
booked mostly but the prices were insane
so it was definitely not taken into

2662
01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:32,670
so it was definitely not taken into
 

2663
01:15:32,670 --> 01:15:33,870
so it was definitely not taken into
[Laughter]

2664
01:15:33,870 --> 01:15:33,880
[Laughter]
 

2665
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:36,110
[Laughter]
consideration it was like per night I

2666
01:15:36,110 --> 01:15:36,120
consideration it was like per night I
 

2667
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:39,270
consideration it was like per night I
don't know 2,000 3,000

2668
01:15:39,270 --> 01:15:39,280
don't know 2,000 3,000
 

2669
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:43,550
don't know 2,000 3,000
4,000 so I I I I can't really imagine

2670
01:15:43,550 --> 01:15:43,560
4,000 so I I I I can't really imagine
 

2671
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:45,629
4,000 so I I I I can't really imagine
maybe it was really fully booked already

2672
01:15:45,629 --> 01:15:45,639
maybe it was really fully booked already
 

2673

01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:54,350

little bit
 

3251
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:14,390
little bit
differently so the old puppets I don't

3252
01:31:14,390 --> 01:31:14,400
differently so the old puppets I don't
 

3253
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:16,870
differently so the old puppets I don't
know if you've noticed but for example

3254
01:31:16,870 --> 01:31:16,880
know if you've noticed but for example
 

3255
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:19,030
know if you've noticed but for example
their

3256
01:31:19,030 --> 01:31:19,040
their
 

3257
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:24,790
their
mouths their mouths uh I

3258
01:31:24,790 --> 01:31:24,800

 

3259
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,709

I used

3260
01:31:26,709 --> 01:31:26,719
I used
 

3261
01:31:26,719 --> 01:31:29,350
I used
to make it with red

3262
01:31:29,350 --> 01:31:29,360
to make it with red
 

3263
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:33,070
to make it with red
paper and then glue it on top of the

3264
01:31:33,070 --> 01:31:33,080
paper and then glue it on top of the
 

3265
01:31:33,080 --> 01:31:35,390
paper and then glue it on top of the
mouth this time I didn't have any red

3266
01:31:35,390 --> 01:31:35,400
mouth this time I didn't have any red
 

3267
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:39,310
mouth this time I didn't have any red
paper so I just decided to just draw it

3268
01:31:39,310 --> 01:31:39,320
paper so I just decided to just draw it
 

3269
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:41,830
paper so I just decided to just draw it
on because I had a red

3270
01:31:41,830 --> 01:31:41,840
on because I had a red
 

3271
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:45,270
on because I had a red
pen and that worked fine can I shoot it

3272
01:31:45,270 --> 01:31:45,280
pen and that worked fine can I shoot it
 

3273
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:50,750
pen and that worked fine can I shoot it
to receive it yes

3274
01:31:50,750 --> 01:31:50,760

 

3275
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:57,629

okay

3276
01:31:57,629 --> 01:31:57,639

 

3277
01:31:57,639 --> 01:32:00,189

nice look good this way yeah I think the

3278
01:32:00,189 --> 01:32:00,199
nice look good this way yeah I think the
 

3279
01:32:00,199 --> 01:32:02,550
nice look good this way yeah I think the
mouths look good this way but I also

3280
01:32:02,550 --> 01:32:02,560
mouths look good this way but I also
 

3281
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:03,550

3283
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:05,109
kind
of

3284
01:32:05,109 --> 01:32:05,119
of
 

3285
01:32:05,119 --> 01:32:09,870
of
somehow somehow their mouths were not as

3286
01:32:09,870 --> 01:32:09,880
somehow somehow their mouths were not as
 

3287
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:15,470
somehow somehow their mouths were not as
flexible as the old puppet's mouth

3288
01:32:15,470 --> 01:32:15,480

 

3289
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:18,470

so it was a bit harder to move them and

3290
01:32:18,470 --> 01:32:18,480
so it was a bit harder to move them and
 

3291
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:21,030
so it was a bit harder to move them and
and open them up probably I just didn't

3292
01:32:21,030 --> 01:32:21,040
and open them up probably I just didn't
 

3293
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:23,270
