2505
01:07:19,579 --> 01:07:22,769

that I thought there was something I could do for everyone, and I wish I
 

2543

2544
01:08:16,750 --> 01:08:19,349

could give something back to everyone who is supporting me even a little like that.  I
guess

2547
01:08:23,019 --> 01:08:23,029
guess
 

2548
01:08:23,029 --> 01:08:26,260
guess
that's why I began to sing songs for preparation, etc.

2549
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:26,270
that's why I began to sing songs for preparation, etc.
 

2550

2555
01:08:35,290 --> 01:08:35,300
Well, it's more than that, because
 

2556
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:38,770
Well, it's more than that, because
there are people who are looking for my voice.  I
