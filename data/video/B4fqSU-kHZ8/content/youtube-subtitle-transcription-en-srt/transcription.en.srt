3139
01:32:07,199 --> 01:32:09,350
that's the talking box oh did I have any
kind of like I I held it in my hand but

3140
01:32:09,350 --> 01:32:09,360
kind of like I I held it in my hand but
 

3141
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:11,450
kind of like I I held it in my hand but
I don't really know how that stuff works

01:32:11,450 --> 01:32:11,460
I don't really know how that stuff works
 

3143
01:32:11,460 --> 01:32:13,550
I don't really know how that stuff works
like did I have any reaction no Spirit

3144

Box reaction from the funnel okay then

3146
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:15,540
Box reaction from the funnel okay then
 

3147
01:32:15,540 --> 01:32:17,390
Box reaction from the funnel okay then
because I had it in my hand the whole

3148
01:32:17,390 --> 01:32:17,400
because I had it in my hand the whole
 

3149

Aloha temperatures can cause the hunter
 

3203
01:33:29,340 --> 01:33:31,070
Aloha temperatures can cause the hunter
to move and faster speed it just kind of

3204
01:33:31,070 --> 01:33:31,080
to move and faster speed it just kind of
 

3205
01:33:31,080 --> 01:33:33,590
to move and faster speed it just kind of
makes a little bit sense

3206
01:33:33,590 --> 01:33:33,600
makes a little bit sense
 

3207
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:36,110
makes a little bit sense
yeah you girls are dead but you can

3208
01:33:36,110 --> 01:33:36,120
