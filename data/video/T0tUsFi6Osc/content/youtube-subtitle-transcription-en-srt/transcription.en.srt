yeah but not the ones on my thumbnail
apparently I thought that you have to

214
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:55,620
apparently I thought that you have to
 

215
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,409
apparently I thought that you have to
get three normal skeleton heads and then

216
00:07:57,409 --> 00:07:57,419
get three normal skeleton heads and then
 

217
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:59,270
get three normal skeleton heads and then
put some coal on them and then they

218
00:07:59,270 --> 00:07:59,280
put some coal on them and then they
 

219
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,550
put some coal on them and then they
become black with their heads no black

220
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:01,560
become black with their heads no black
 

221
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,430
become black with their heads no black
or skeleton heads that would be clever

222
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:04,440
or skeleton heads that would be clever
 

223
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,950
or skeleton heads that would be clever
it's just because I was Googling

224
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:06,960
it's just because I was Googling
 

225
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,409
it's just because I was Googling
um like skeleton heads on Google for a

226
00:08:09,409 --> 00:08:09,419
um like skeleton heads on Google for a
 

227
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:12,650
um like skeleton heads on Google for a
PNG and then I saw one which was like a

228
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:12,660
PNG and then I saw one which was like a
 

229
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,129
PNG and then I saw one which was like a
recipe like they were making it uh like

230
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:16,139
recipe like they were making it uh like
 

231
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:18,650
recipe like they were making it uh like
someone's custom yeah maybe that was I

232
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:18,660
someone's custom yeah maybe that was I
 

233
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,150
someone's custom yeah maybe that was I
guess that was fake I guess you don't do

234
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:20,160
guess that was fake I guess you don't do
 

235
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,189
guess that was fake I guess you don't do
that because of that I thought you put

236
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:22,199
that because of that I thought you put
 

237
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:24,529
that because of that I thought you put
one skeleton and you need four coal and

238
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:24,539
one skeleton and you need four coal and
 

239
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:27,770
one skeleton and you need four coal and
then it turns it black

240
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:27,780

 

241
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,409

it's it's hard to get a skeleton skull

242
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:30,419
it's it's hard to get a skeleton skull
 

243
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:32,690
it's it's hard to get a skeleton skull

00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:24,420
researched a lot on how portals work
 

2345
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:26,510
researched a lot on how portals work
um they're not actually linked to one

2346
00:58:26,510 --> 00:58:26,520
um they're not actually linked to one
 

2347
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:28,730
um they're not actually linked to one
another like if you build a portal it

2348
00:58:28,730 --> 00:58:28,740
another like if you build a portal it
 

2349
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:31,250
another like if you build a portal it
doesn't necessarily link to a portal on

2350
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:31,260
doesn't necessarily link to a portal on
 

2351
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:33,530
doesn't necessarily link to a portal on
the other side it just sends you to the

2352
00:58:33,530 --> 00:58:33,540
the other side it just sends you to the
 

2353
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:36,289
the other side it just sends you to the
closest portal of the corresponding

2354
00:58:36,289 --> 00:58:36,299
closest portal of the corresponding
 

2355
00:58:36,299 --> 00:58:38,450
closest portal of the corresponding
coordinates in the Overworld so that's

2356
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:38,460
coordinates in the Overworld so that's
 

2357
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:40,670
coordinates in the Overworld so that's
why you can have a situation where

2358
00:58:40,670 --> 00:58:40,680
why you can have a situation where
 

2359
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:43,130
why you can have a situation where
you could have like three portals that

2360
00:58:43,130 --> 00:58:43,140
you could have like three portals that
 

2361
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:46,250
you could have like three portals that
are linked which is very annoying yes

makes sense and do you think we'll get
 

3053
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:08,450
makes sense and do you think we'll get
it pretty quickly but I heard that it's

3054

0.5 percentage of chance of getting it
 

3061
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:14,990
0.5 percentage of chance of getting it
should be way higher with looting three

5187
02:07:38,760 --> 02:07:41,149
and all that but for some reason
I already forgot what my exact words

5188
02:07:41,149 --> 02:07:41,159

something about it was just like

5192
02:07:49,609 --> 02:07:49,619

 

5193
02:07:49,619 --> 02:07:52,550

please did you feel that way about the

5194
02:07:52,550 --> 02:07:52,560
please did you feel that way about the
 

5195
02:07:52,560 --> 02:07:54,890
please did you feel that way about the
first two seasons as well or just the

5196
02:07:54,890 --> 02:07:54,900
first two seasons as well or just the
 

5197
02:07:54,900 --> 02:07:57,530
first two seasons as well or just the
third season I think

5198
02:07:57,530 --> 02:07:57,540
third season I think
 

5199
02:07:57,540 --> 02:08:01,209
third season I think
I may have partially had those feelings

5200
02:08:01,209 --> 02:08:01,219
