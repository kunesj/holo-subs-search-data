1121
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:21,790
this game together and they're like so
good at it and so I saw them looking for

1122
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:21,800
good at it and so I saw them looking for
 

1123
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:26,030
good at it and so I saw them looking for
like the name of the streets like the

numbers of the streets and then finding
 

1127
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:31,370
numbers of the streets and then finding
the highways on the map and then yeah so

1128
