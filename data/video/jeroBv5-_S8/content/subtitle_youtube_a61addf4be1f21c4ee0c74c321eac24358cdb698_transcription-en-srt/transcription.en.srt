up again at 5am
 

7456
03:15:56,880 --> 03:15:58,969
up again at 5am
so you're getting like seven hours sleep

7457
03:15:58,969 --> 03:15:58,979
so you're getting like seven hours sleep
 

7458
03:15:58,979 --> 03:16:01,130
so you're getting like seven hours sleep
if you fall asleep right away

I could
and just go to bed now and do this

9007
03:56:13,670 --> 03:56:13,680
and just go to bed now and do this
 

9008
