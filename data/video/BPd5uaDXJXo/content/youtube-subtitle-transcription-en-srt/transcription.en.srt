but
 

1641
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,470
but
well

1642
00:57:15,470 --> 00:57:15,480
well
 

1643
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:18,049
well
so I know that was the beginning for her

1644
00:57:18,049 --> 00:57:18,059
so I know that was the beginning for her
 

1645
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:20,930
so I know that was the beginning for her
like her not quite it was

1646
00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:20,940
like her not quite it was
 

1647
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:23,569
like her not quite it was
not the beginning after she traveled

1648
00:57:23,569 --> 00:57:23,579
not the beginning after she traveled
 

1649
00:57:23,579 --> 00:57:25,370
not the beginning after she traveled
through time right

1650
00:57:25,370 --> 00:57:25,380
through time right
 

1651
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:28,910
through time right
but it's the her point of view of like

1652
00:57:28,910 --> 00:57:28,920
but it's the her point of view of like
 

1653
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:32,630
but it's the her point of view of like
ages ago when we sent out the sword via

1654
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:32,640
ages ago when we sent out the sword via
 

1655
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:33,950
ages ago when we sent out the sword via
FedEx

1656

FedEx
 

1657
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:37,069
FedEx
and then the sword tells her like

1658
00:57:37,069 --> 00:57:37,079
and then the sword tells her like
 

1659
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:39,410
and then the sword tells her like
reminds her of things that

1660
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:39,420
reminds her of things that
 

1661
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:43,790
reminds her of things that
she didn't really do yet or here yet

1662

she didn't really do yet or here yet

I guess but now I mean you know Paradox
time paradox

1666

00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:56,400
later after
 

1671
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,030

1723
00:59:31,619 --> 00:59:46,130

1729
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:05,170

maybe there's a way of

1730
01:00:05,170 --> 01:00:05,180
maybe there's a way of
 

1731
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:08,089
maybe there's a way of
using all the knowledge and the time

1732
01:00:08,089 --> 01:00:08,099
using all the knowledge and the time
 

1733
01:00:08,099 --> 01:00:10,789
using all the knowledge and the time
traveling to her Advantage so that she

1734
01:00:10,789 --> 01:00:10,799
traveling to her Advantage so that she
 

1735
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:13,849
traveling to her Advantage so that she
can turn into a dragon but also go back

1736
01:00:13,849 --> 01:00:13,859
can turn into a dragon but also go back
 

1737
01:00:13,859 --> 01:00:23,589
can turn into a dragon but also go back
to non-dragon

1738
01:00:23,589 --> 01:00:23,599

 

1739
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:27,049

right but um I mean otherwise that would

1740
01:00:27,049 --> 01:00:27,059
right but um I mean otherwise that would
 

1741
01:00:27,059 --> 01:00:28,789
right but um I mean otherwise that would
be insane why would she do that where's

1742
01:00:28,789 --> 01:00:28,799
be insane why would she do that where's
 

1743

probably just [\h__\h] in there I did not

1766
01:01:15,770 --> 01:01:15,780
probably just [\h__\h] in there I did not
 

1767

don't care not worth it unless you're
trying to get hundred percent and then

1774
01:01:28,849 --> 01:01:28,859
trying to get hundred percent and then
 

1775
01:01:28,859 --> 01:01:31,609
trying to get hundred percent and then
you also kind of question yourself

1776
01:01:31,609 --> 01:01:31,619
you also kind of question yourself
 

1777
01:01:31,619 --> 01:01:33,589
you also kind of question yourself
is it really worth it you glitched out

1778
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:33,599
is it really worth it you glitched out
 

1779

02:26:51,490 --> 02:26:51,500
this was such a good comparison actually
 

4589
02:26:51,500 --> 02:26:55,309
this was such a good comparison actually
and I was I was thinking like hmm the

4590
02:26:55,309 --> 02:26:55,319
and I was I was thinking like hmm the
 

4591
02:26:55,319 --> 02:26:58,670
and I was I was thinking like hmm the
curve of the butt itself isn't like much

4592
02:26:58,670 --> 02:26:58,680
curve of the butt itself isn't like much
 

4593
02:26:58,680 --> 02:27:02,330
curve of the butt itself isn't like much
more compared to the old model and yet

4594
02:27:02,330 --> 02:27:02,340
more compared to the old model and yet
 

4595
02:27:02,340 --> 02:27:05,450
more compared to the old model and yet
it overall looks like a buffed right

4596
02:27:05,450 --> 02:27:05,460
it overall looks like a buffed right
 

4597
02:27:05,460 --> 02:27:07,309
it overall looks like a buffed right
especially from a different angle and

4598
02:27:07,309 --> 02:27:07,319
especially from a different angle and
 

4599
02:27:07,319 --> 02:27:09,950
especially from a different angle and
then what I realized is rather than

4600
02:27:09,950 --> 02:27:09,960
then what I realized is rather than
 

4601
02:27:09,960 --> 02:27:13,309
then what I realized is rather than
buffing the butt only the fights got

4602
02:27:13,309 --> 02:27:13,319
buffing the butt only the fights got
 

4603
02:27:13,319 --> 02:27:14,990
buffing the butt only the fights got
thicker

guess actually that's at least something
 

8468
04:18:25,380 --> 04:18:30,830
guess actually that's at least something
original and different from what you do

8469
04:18:30,830 --> 04:18:30,840
original and different from what you do
 

8470
04:18:30,840 --> 04:18:33,290
original and different from what you do
but I don't know if I if I really

8471
04:18:33,290 --> 04:18:33,300
but I don't know if I if I really
 

8472
04:18:33,300 --> 04:18:35,750
but I don't know if I if I really
like if I do that if there's even really

8473
04:18:35,750 --> 04:18:35,760
like if I do that if there's even really
 

8474
04:18:35,760 --> 04:18:38,750
like if I do that if there's even really
a like

8475
04:18:38,750 --> 04:18:38,760
a like
 

8476
04:18:38,760 --> 04:18:40,610
a like
if there's Japanese viewers who really

8477
04:18:40,610 --> 04:18:40,620
if there's Japanese viewers who really
 

8478
04:18:40,620 --> 04:18:42,530
if there's Japanese viewers who really
want to see that

8479
04:18:42,530 --> 04:18:42,540
want to see that
 

8480
04:18:42,540 --> 04:18:46,689

8482
04:18:46,699 --> 04:18:50,150

it's a good idea though like at least to

8483
04:18:50,150 --> 04:18:50,160
it's a good idea though like at least to
 

8484
04:18:50,160 --> 04:18:53,929
it's a good idea though like at least to
make use of the background

8485
04:18:53,929 --> 04:18:53,939
make use of the background
 

8486
04:18:53,939 --> 04:18:55,729

something that the en viewers could
enjoy I wasn't really planning on

8493

doing it for the Japanese views but it

8495
04:19:06,290 --> 04:19:06,300
doing it for the Japanese views but it
 

8496
04:19:06,300 --> 04:19:08,210
doing it for the Japanese views but it
could be a way for me to also reconnect

8497
04:19:08,210 --> 04:19:08,220
could be a way for me to also reconnect
 

8498

I just I just wonder if there's a demand
for it really

8509
04:19:26,510 --> 04:19:26,520
for it really
 

8510
04:19:26,520 --> 04:19:29,269
for it really
I don't know we could test it out at

8511
04:19:29,269 --> 04:19:29,279
I don't know we could test it out at
 

8512
04:19:29,279 --> 04:19:31,550
I don't know we could test it out at
least

8513

8514
04:19:31,560 --> 04:19:33,590

um

8515
04:19:33,590 --> 04:19:33,600
um
 

8516
04:19:33,600 --> 04:19:36,229
um
I could test it out

8517
04:19:36,229 --> 04:19:36,239
I could test it out
 

8518
04:19:36,239 --> 04:19:38,570
I could test it out
see how it goes

8519
04:19:38,570 --> 04:19:38,580
see how it goes
 

8520
04:19:38,580 --> 04:19:41,030
see how it goes
because I think at least you know I I

8521
04:19:41,030 --> 04:19:41,040
because I think at least you know I I
 

8522
04:19:41,040 --> 04:19:42,530
because I think at least you know I I
don't wanna

8523
04:19:42,530 --> 04:19:42,540

04:19:48,469 --> 04:19:48,479
I just have this
 

8528
04:19:48,479 --> 04:19:51,889

I don't think we need two news programs

8529
04:19:51,889 --> 04:19:51,899
I don't think we need two news programs
 

8530
04:19:51,899 --> 04:19:54,830

for Ian you know what I mean

8531
04:19:54,830 --> 04:19:54,840
for Ian you know what I mean
 

8532
04:19:54,840 --> 04:19:59,030
for Ian you know what I mean
which is 10 people

8533
04:19:59,030 --> 04:19:59,040

 

8534
04:19:59,040 --> 04:20:01,250

then we don't need to wait we're just

8535
04:20:01,250 --> 04:20:01,260
then we don't need to wait we're just

so then

8539
04:20:07,130 --> 04:20:07,140
so then
 

8540
04:20:07,140 --> 04:20:10,250
so then
I would even give up on the idea which

8541
04:20:10,250 --> 04:20:10,260
I would even give up on the idea which
 

8542
04:20:10,260 --> 04:20:11,689
I would even give up on the idea which
is fine too because I don't know how

8543
04:20:11,689 --> 04:20:11,699
is fine too because I don't know how
 

8544
04:20:11,699 --> 04:20:14,090

there were like times where I was
 

8552
04:20:19,260 --> 04:20:20,689
there were like times where I was
motivated about it and then I wasn't

8553
04:20:20,689 --> 04:20:20,699
motivated about it and then I wasn't
 

8554
04:20:20,699 --> 04:20:23,150
motivated about it and then I wasn't
motivated about it after all so I'm fine

8555
04:20:23,150 --> 04:20:23,160
motivated about it after all so I'm fine
 

8556
04:20:23,160 --> 04:20:25,490

04:20:28,429 --> 04:20:28,439
feeling bad about the background so at
 

8560
04:20:28,439 --> 04:20:30,889

11578
05:54:46,680 --> 05:54:48,650
of all three of them surely
won't have

11579
05:54:48,650 --> 05:54:48,660
won't have
 

11580
05:54:48,660 --> 05:54:50,628
won't have
that problem right

11581
05:54:50,628 --> 05:54:50,638
that problem right
 

11582
05:54:50,638 --> 05:54:51,570
that problem right
let's try

11583
05:54:51,570 --> 05:54:51,580
let's try

11588
05:55:05,480 --> 05:55:07,730

you think it's because of the lack of

11589
05:55:07,730 --> 05:55:07,740
you think it's because of the lack of
 

11590
05:55:07,740 --> 05:55:10,270
you think it's because of the lack of
balance really

11591
05:55:10,270 --> 05:55:10,280
balance really
 

11592
05:55:10,280 --> 05:55:13,310
balance really
who's the third

11593
05:55:13,310 --> 05:55:13,320
who's the third
 

11594
05:55:13,320 --> 05:55:15,288
who's the third

you need to eat I need all the parts
 

11596
05:55:15,298 --> 05:55:18,890
you need to eat I need all the parts
given

11597
05:55:18,890 --> 05:55:18,900

 

11598
05:55:18,900 --> 05:55:21,830

what

11599
05:55:21,830 --> 05:55:21,840

 

11600
05:55:21,840 --> 05:55:24,770

I know normally you don't necessarily

11601
05:55:24,770 --> 05:55:24,780
I know normally you don't necessarily
 

11602
05:55:24,780 --> 05:55:26,270
I know normally you don't necessarily
need all parts there's always a

11603
05:55:26,270 --> 05:55:26,280
need all parts there's always a
 

11604
05:55:26,280 --> 05:55:28,070
need all parts there's always a
different way of doing it

11605
05:55:28,070 --> 05:55:28,080
different way of doing it
 

11606
05:55:28,080 --> 05:55:30,190
different way of doing it
um

11607
05:55:30,190 --> 05:55:30,200

 

11608
05:55:30,200 --> 05:55:32,690

can I amend

11609
05:55:32,690 --> 05:55:32,700
can I amend
 

11610
05:55:32,700 --> 05:55:38,570
can I amend
the rails

11611
05:55:38,570 --> 05:55:38,580

 

11612
05:55:38,580 --> 05:55:45,650

oh

11613
05:55:45,650 --> 05:55:45,660

 

11614
05:55:45,660 --> 05:55:50,470

how about this

11615
05:55:50,470 --> 05:55:50,480

 

11616
05:55:50,480 --> 05:55:58,670

I mean

11617
05:55:58,670 --> 05:55:58,680

 

11618
05:55:58,680 --> 05:56:01,490

went wrong we're running away

11619
05:56:01,490 --> 05:56:01,500
went wrong we're running away
 

11620
05:56:01,500 --> 05:56:04,070
went wrong we're running away
let's see it

11621
05:56:04,070 --> 05:56:04,080
let's see it
 

11622
05:56:04,080 --> 05:56:08,810
let's see it
it's not gonna work probably

11623
05:56:08,810 --> 05:56:08,820

 

11624
05:56:08,820 --> 05:56:15,190

go in

11625
05:56:15,190 --> 05:56:15,200

 

11626
05:56:15,200 --> 05:56:21,430

no way

11627
05:56:21,430 --> 05:56:21,440

 

11628
05:56:21,440 --> 05:56:45,128

I can't even climb up

11629
05:56:45,128 --> 05:56:45,138

 

11630
05:56:45,138 --> 05:56:48,050

I'll start from the beginning

11631
05:56:48,050 --> 05:56:48,060
I'll start from the beginning
 

11632
05:56:48,060 --> 05:56:48,200
I'll start from the beginning

11636
05:56:51,740 --> 05:56:55,970

but eh

11637
05:56:55,970 --> 05:56:55,980

 

11638
05:56:55,980 --> 05:57:05,530

uh

11639
05:57:05,530 --> 05:57:05,540

 

11640
05:57:05,540 --> 05:57:23,868

a very good place to start

11641
05:57:23,868 --> 05:57:23,878

 

11642
05:57:23,878 --> 05:57:29,090

you walked the rails

11643
05:57:29,090 --> 05:57:29,100

 

11644
05:57:29,100 --> 05:57:33,410

oh my God

11645
05:57:33,410 --> 05:57:33,420

 

11646
05:57:33,420 --> 05:57:35,690

this can't be any why this basically

11647
05:57:35,690 --> 05:57:35,700
this can't be any why this basically
 

11648
05:57:35,700 --> 05:57:37,430
this can't be any why this basically
switched out the middle of the short

11649
05:57:37,430 --> 05:57:37,440
switched out the middle of the short
 

11650
05:57:37,440 --> 05:57:39,410
switched out the middle of the short
middle blade

11651
05:57:39,410 --> 05:57:39,420
middle blade
 

11652
05:57:39,420 --> 05:57:41,868
middle blade
for

11653
05:57:41,868 --> 05:57:41,878
for
 

11654
05:57:41,878 --> 05:57:46,250
for
the long one

11655
05:57:46,250 --> 05:57:46,260
the long one
 

11656
05:57:46,260 --> 05:57:48,830
the long one
why would this work now maybe because I

11657
05:57:48,830 --> 05:57:48,840
why would this work now maybe because I
 

11658
05:57:48,840 --> 05:57:51,170
why would this work now maybe because I
can use both but then it's it stops

11659
05:57:51,170 --> 05:57:51,180
can use both but then it's it stops
 

11660
05:57:51,180 --> 05:57:54,890
can use both but then it's it stops
being too at some point

11661
05:57:54,890 --> 05:57:54,900

 

11662
05:57:54,900 --> 05:58:01,190

um I'm almost correct wait a second

11663
05:58:01,190 --> 05:58:01,200

 

11664
05:58:01,200 --> 05:58:04,670

I mean if I have to use all parts

11665
05:58:04,670 --> 05:58:04,680
I mean if I have to use all parts
 

11666
05:58:04,680 --> 05:58:07,730
I mean if I have to use all parts
there's only so many

11667
05:58:07,730 --> 05:58:07,740
there's only so many
 

11668
05:58:07,740 --> 05:58:13,788
there's only so many
logical eh logical options

11669
05:58:13,788 --> 05:58:13,798

 

11670
05:58:13,798 --> 05:58:16,610

right

11671
05:58:16,610 --> 05:58:16,620

 

11672
05:58:16,620 --> 05:58:17,690

so

11673
05:58:17,690 --> 05:58:17,700
so
 

11674
05:58:17,700 --> 05:58:19,250
so
I mean this

11675
05:58:19,250 --> 05:58:19,260
I mean this
 

11676
05:58:19,260 --> 05:58:22,490
I mean this
looks like incredibly stable but once it

11677
05:58:22,490 --> 05:58:22,500
looks like incredibly stable but once it
 

11678
05:58:22,500 --> 05:58:25,670
looks like incredibly stable but once it
loses One path

11679
05:58:25,670 --> 05:58:25,680
loses One path
 

11680
05:58:25,680 --> 05:58:31,430
loses One path
what's gonna happen

11681
05:58:31,430 --> 05:58:31,440

 

11682
05:58:31,440 --> 05:58:42,350

it fitsub do I need all of these

11683
05:58:42,350 --> 05:58:42,360

 

11684
05:58:42,360 --> 05:58:45,170

I wonder if I could just make also like

11685
05:58:45,170 --> 05:58:45,180
I wonder if I could just make also like
 

11686
05:58:45,180 --> 05:58:46,010
I wonder if I could just make also like
a

11687
05:58:46,010 --> 05:58:46,020
a
 

11688
05:58:46,020 --> 05:58:48,590
a
like a not a hovercraft but you know

11689
05:58:48,590 --> 05:58:48,600
like a not a hovercraft but you know
 

11690
05:58:48,600 --> 05:58:49,788
like a not a hovercraft but you know
like one of those

11691
05:58:49,788 --> 05:58:49,798
like one of those
 

11692

like one of those
like a platform with all the fans facing

11693
05:58:52,850 --> 05:58:52,860
like a platform with all the fans facing
 

11694
05:58:52,860 --> 05:58:54,890
like a platform with all the fans facing
the ground and just get a lot of height

11695
05:58:54,890 --> 05:58:54,900
the ground and just get a lot of height
 

11696
05:58:54,900 --> 05:58:57,288
the ground and just get a lot of height
and then fly with my

11697
05:58:57,288 --> 05:58:57,298
and then fly with my
 

11698
05:58:57,298 --> 05:59:00,470
and then fly with my
just fly over with my

11699

just fly over with my
 

11700
05:59:00,480 --> 05:59:04,548
just fly over with my
paraglider

11701
05:59:04,548 --> 05:59:04,558

11724
05:59:39,298 --> 05:59:43,190
how's this one succeeding in my previous
invention which was basically the same

11725
05:59:43,190 --> 05:59:43,200
invention which was basically the same
 

11726
05:59:43,200 --> 05:59:44,390
invention which was basically the same
just

11727
05:59:44,390 --> 05:59:44,400
just
 

11728
05:59:44,400 --> 05:59:47,150
just
less lengthy

11729
05:59:47,150 --> 05:59:47,160
less lengthy
 

11730
05:59:47,160 --> 05:59:51,670
less lengthy
is failing

11731
05:59:51,670 --> 05:59:51,680

 

11732
05:59:51,680 --> 05:59:55,080

07:16:36,620 --> 07:16:40,430
yeah yeah it's
rap and making me busy there's a lot of

14535
07:16:40,430 --> 07:16:40,440
rap and making me busy there's a lot of
 

14536
07:16:40,440 --> 07:16:44,690
rap and making me busy there's a lot of
things to organize that I'm kind of like

14537
07:16:44,690 --> 07:16:44,700
things to organize that I'm kind of like
 

14538
07:16:44,700 --> 07:16:47,650
things to organize that I'm kind of like
taking into my own hands

taking into my own hands

07:16:47,660 --> 07:16:52,250
taking into my own hands
it's very different from like how Cali

14541
07:16:52,250 --> 07:16:52,260
it's very different from like how Cali
 

14542
07:16:52,260 --> 07:16:55,070
it's very different from like how Cali
does stuff I think because she's with a

14543
07:16:55,070 --> 07:16:55,080
does stuff I think because she's with a
 

14544
07:16:55,080 --> 07:16:56,208
does stuff I think because she's with a
label

14545
07:16:56,208 --> 07:16:56,218
label
 

14546
07:16:56,218 --> 07:16:58,670
label
I mean she writes her lyrics

14547
07:16:58,670 --> 07:16:58,680
I mean she writes her lyrics
 

14548
07:16:58,680 --> 07:17:00,650
I mean she writes her lyrics
so that's like an extra piece of work

14549
07:17:00,650 --> 07:17:00,660
so that's like an extra piece of work
 

14550
07:17:00,660 --> 07:17:02,030
so that's like an extra piece of work
that I don't have

14551
07:17:02,030 --> 07:17:02,040
that I don't have
 

14552
07:17:02,040 --> 07:17:04,368
that I don't have
but I think her label probably takes

14553
07:17:04,368 --> 07:17:04,378
but I think her label probably takes
 

14554
07:17:04,378 --> 07:17:07,788
but I think her label probably takes
care of a lot of the other things

14555
07:17:07,788 --> 07:17:07,798
care of a lot of the other things
 

14556
07:17:07,798 --> 07:17:10,850
care of a lot of the other things
mm-hmm

14557
07:17:10,850 --> 07:17:10,860

 

14558
07:17:10,860 --> 07:17:12,948

and I don't have that so it's taking

14559
07:17:12,948 --> 07:17:12,958
and I don't have that so it's taking
 

14560
07:17:12,958 --> 07:17:17,570
and I don't have that so it's taking
more time and it's taking more like

14561
07:17:17,570 --> 07:17:17,580
more time and it's taking more like
 

14562
07:17:17,580 --> 07:17:20,230
more time and it's taking more like
effort from my brain

14563
07:17:20,230 --> 07:17:20,240
effort from my brain
 

14564
07:17:20,240 --> 07:17:22,968
effort from my brain
but it will hopefully be worth it in the

14565
07:17:22,968 --> 07:17:22,978
but it will hopefully be worth it in the

end and I hope you guys will enjoy it
