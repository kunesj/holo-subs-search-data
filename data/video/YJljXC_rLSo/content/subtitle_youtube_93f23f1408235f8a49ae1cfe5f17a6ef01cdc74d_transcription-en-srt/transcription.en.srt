like somewhere in the beginning I must

10528
04:32:55,269 --> 04:32:55,279
like somewhere in the beginning I must
 

10529
04:32:55,279 --> 04:32:58,070
like somewhere in the beginning I must
have gotten lost and then never able to

10530
04:32:58,070 --> 04:32:58,080
have gotten lost and then never able to
 

10531
04:32:58,080 --> 04:33:00,790
have gotten lost and then never able to
catch up and then the pressure and just

10532
04:33:00,790 --> 04:33:00,800
catch up and then the pressure and just
 

10533
04:33:00,800 --> 04:33:03,790
catch up and then the pressure and just
the already the feeling of being a loser

10534
04:33:03,790 --> 04:33:03,800
the already the feeling of being a loser
 

10535
04:33:03,800 --> 04:33:05,551
the already the feeling of being a loser
and not understanding

10536
04:33:05,551 --> 04:33:05,561
and not understanding
 

10537
04:33:05,561 --> 04:33:09,830
and not understanding
things would always be a blockage for

10538
04:33:09,830 --> 04:33:09,840
things would always be a blockage for
 

10539
04:33:09,840 --> 04:33:14,590
things would always be a blockage for
me I was never able to to get past that

10540
04:33:14,590 --> 04:33:14,600
me I was never able to to get past that
 

10541
04:33:14,600 --> 04:33:17,949
me I was never able to to get past that
I guess and then I would repeat a year

10542
04:33:17,949 --> 04:33:17,959
I guess and then I would repeat a year
 

10543
04:33:17,959 --> 04:33:19,789
