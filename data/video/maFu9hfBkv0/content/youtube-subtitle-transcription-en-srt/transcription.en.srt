you because like if it's for a whole

8640
03:54:14,229 --> 03:54:14,239
you because like if it's for a whole
 

8641
03:54:14,239 --> 03:54:16,269
you because like if it's for a whole

8642
03:54:16,269 --> 03:54:16,279
month I told you it always gets paid out
 

8643
03:54:16,279 --> 03:54:18,830
month I told you it always gets paid out
like my salary gets paid out on the last

8644
03:54:18,830 --> 03:54:18,840
like my salary gets paid out on the last
 

8645
03:54:18,840 --> 03:54:21,229
like my salary gets paid out on the last
day of the month if I still get another

8646
03:54:21,229 --> 03:54:21,239
day of the month if I still get another
 

8647
03:54:21,239 --> 03:54:25,070
day of the month if I still get another
Super Chat on that last day of the month

8648
03:54:25,070 --> 03:54:25,080
Super Chat on that last day of the month
 

8649
03:54:25,080 --> 03:54:27,070
Super Chat on that last day of the month
then that wouldn't be part of the salary

8650
03:54:27,070 --> 03:54:27,080
then that wouldn't be part of the salary
 

8651
03:54:27,080 --> 03:54:31,149
then that wouldn't be part of the salary
so everything just gets delayed by like
