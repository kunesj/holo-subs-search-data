okay four d ten greater than symbol
do you know what the greater than symbol

260
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:07,440
do you know what the greater than symbol
 

261
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:17,029
do you know what the greater than symbol
is it's like a sideways v

262
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:17,039

 

263
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,749

listen for d10

272
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:28,639
listen for d10
 

273
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,350
listen for d10
for d10 greater than eight i will type

274
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:31,360
for d10 greater than eight i will type
 

275
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,509
for d10 greater than eight i will type
it for you looks like this

276
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:33,519
it for you looks like this
 

277
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,709
it for you looks like this
i got zero successes yes it is eating

278
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:36,719
i got zero successes yes it is eating
 

279
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,070
i got zero successes yes it is eating
the bigger number okay let's see how

280
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:38,080
the bigger number okay let's see how
 

281
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,310
the bigger number okay let's see how
many successes you get

282
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:40,320
many successes you get
 

283
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,750
many successes you get
okay so forward slash rolled for d10

284
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:43,760
okay so forward slash rolled for d10
 

285
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,790
okay so forward slash rolled for d10
greater than and then go right and yeah

286
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:46,800
greater than and then go right and yeah
 

287
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,550
greater than and then go right and yeah
okay perception yeah i got the bar by

288
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:48,560
okay perception yeah i got the bar by
 

289
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,269
okay perception yeah i got the bar by
the boat mathematics

290
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:51,279
the boat mathematics
 

291
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,230
the boat mathematics
um that's a capital that's a capital d

292
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:54,240
um that's a capital that's a capital d
 

293
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,990
um that's a capital that's a capital d
uh so use a lower case d

294
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:56,000
uh so use a lower case d
 

295
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,590
uh so use a lower case d
and then put in eight okay

296
00:08:59,590 --> 00:08:59,600

 

297
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,070

wait there's an eight at the end yeah

298
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,080
wait there's an eight at the end yeah
 

299
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,750
wait there's an eight at the end yeah
you want it to be greater than eight

300
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:03,760
you want it to be greater than eight
 

301
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,110
you want it to be greater than eight
because that will count all of your

302
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:05,120
because that will count all of your
 

303
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,269
because that will count all of your
successes eight nine and ten

304
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:07,279
successes eight nine and ten
 

305
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,710
successes eight nine and ten
and it'll tell you how many successes

306
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:08,720
and it'll tell you how many successes
 

307
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,110
and it'll tell you how many successes
you got

308
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:11,120
you got
 

309
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,470
you got
it was anything over eight counts

310
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:14,480
it was anything over eight counts
 

311
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,470
it was anything over eight counts
exactly okay roll four slash roll

312
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:18,480
exactly okay roll four slash roll
 

313
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,670
exactly okay roll four slash roll
four d ten greater than

314
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:21,680
four d ten greater than
 

315
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,389
four d ten greater than
eight yes essentially exactly what i

316
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:24,399
eight yes essentially exactly what i
 

317
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,430
eight yes essentially exactly what i
rolled just now

318
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:27,440

 

319
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,230

okay one success yay okay nice job yeah

00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:32,880
you did it first roll the game wow
 

323
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,790
you did it first roll the game wow
technically the first fill was the four

324
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:34,800
technically the first fill was the four

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,230
technically the first fill was the four
which is fitting somehow

326
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:36,240
which is fitting somehow
 

327
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,070
which is fitting somehow
um since it's my campaign and four is a

328
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:38,080
um since it's my campaign and four is a
 

329
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,150
um since it's my campaign and four is a
great number but um this is good

330
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:40,160
great number but um this is good
 

331
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,790
great number but um this is good
this is a good start guys uh get ready

332
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:42,800
this is a good start guys uh get ready
 

333
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,110
this is a good start guys uh get ready
for these kinds of successes

334
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:45,120
for these kinds of successes
 

335
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,150
for these kinds of successes
um so you get one success

336
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:48,160
um so you get one success
 

337
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,829
um so you get one success
to basically perceive that this is a bar

01:00:35,589 --> 01:00:35,599
right and they fulfill that goal you get
 

2825
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:37,190
right and they fulfill that goal you get
one beat

2826
01:00:37,190 --> 01:00:37,200
one beat
 

2827
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,510
one beat
at the end of the session okay next

2828
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:39,520
at the end of the session okay next
 

2829
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:40,549
at the end of the session okay next
number two

2830
01:00:40,549 --> 01:00:40,559
number two
 

2831
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:43,430
number two
um let's see each uh let's see what is

2832
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:43,440
um let's see each uh let's see what is
 

2833
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:44,230
um let's see each uh let's see what is
this

2834
01:00:44,230 --> 01:00:44,240
this
 

2835
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,150
this
each condition has criteria for

2836
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:46,160
each condition has criteria for
 

2837
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:48,150
each condition has criteria for
resolution so when resolving a condition

2838
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:48,160
resolution so when resolving a condition
 

2839
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:50,549
resolution so when resolving a condition
a condition take a beat uh for example

2840
01:00:50,549 --> 01:00:50,559
a condition take a beat uh for example
 

2841
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:51,430
a condition take a beat uh for example
um

2842
01:00:51,430 --> 01:00:51,440
um
 

2843
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:54,230
um
in some of the tutorials some of you may

2844
01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:54,240
in some of the tutorials some of you may
 

2845
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,470
in some of the tutorials some of you may
have gotten a little a little twisted

2846
01:00:56,470 --> 01:00:56,480
have gotten a little a little twisted
 

2847
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:00,390
have gotten a little a little twisted
um some in some kind of mental way um

2848
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:00,400
um some in some kind of mental way um
 

2849
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,630
um some in some kind of mental way um
which is me applying a condition to you

2850
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:02,640
which is me applying a condition to you
 

2851
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:04,549
which is me applying a condition to you
um conditions can range from being good

2852
01:01:04,549 --> 01:01:04,559
um conditions can range from being good
 

2853
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:05,349
um conditions can range from being good
or bad

2854
01:01:05,349 --> 01:01:05,359
or bad
 

2855
01:01:05,359 --> 01:01:08,309
or bad
um but when you resolve that condition

2856
01:01:08,309 --> 01:01:08,319
um but when you resolve that condition
 

2857
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:09,190
um but when you resolve that condition
um

2858
01:01:09,190 --> 01:01:09,200
um
 

2859
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,750
um
then you get a beat okay so for example

2860
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:11,760
then you get a beat okay so for example
 

2861
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:12,309
then you get a beat okay so for example
i think

2862
01:01:12,309 --> 01:01:12,319
i think
 

2863
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:15,589
i think
actually um you'll be all right

2864
01:01:15,589 --> 01:01:15,599
actually um you'll be all right
 

2865
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:17,270
actually um you'll be all right
when you went to the party and you were

2866
01:01:17,270 --> 01:01:17,280
when you went to the party and you were
 

2867
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,630
when you went to the party and you were
inspired

2868
01:01:18,630 --> 01:01:18,640
inspired
 

2869
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:20,630
inspired
right yeah um i would give you a beat

2870
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:20,640
right yeah um i would give you a beat
 

2871
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,390
right yeah um i would give you a beat
for that

2872
01:01:22,390 --> 01:01:22,400
for that
 

2873
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,069
for that
i think it's more it's supposed to be

2874
01:01:24,069 --> 01:01:24,079
i think it's more it's supposed to be
 

2875
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:26,230
i think it's more it's supposed to be
more for negative ones but i'd do it

2876
01:01:26,230 --> 01:01:26,240
more for negative ones but i'd do it
 

2877
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,069
more for negative ones but i'd do it
anyway for positive ones as well if you

2878
01:01:28,069 --> 01:01:28,079
anyway for positive ones as well if you
 

2879
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:29,589
anyway for positive ones as well if you
get some kind of condition

2880
01:01:29,589 --> 01:01:29,599
get some kind of condition
 

2881
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:32,630
get some kind of condition
uh you will get one beat number three um

2882
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:32,640
uh you will get one beat number three um
 

2883
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:35,990
uh you will get one beat number three um
let's see what is this

2884
01:01:35,990 --> 01:01:36,000

 

2885
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,950

um any time that you fail a roll you may

2886
01:01:38,950 --> 01:01:38,960
um any time that you fail a roll you may
 

2887
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,630
um any time that you fail a roll you may
opt to make it a dramatic failure and

2888
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:40,640
opt to make it a dramatic failure and
 

2889
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:41,430
opt to make it a dramatic failure and
take a beat

2890
01:01:41,430 --> 01:01:41,440
take a beat
 

2891
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:45,109
take a beat
okay that means that means

2892
01:01:45,109 --> 01:01:45,119
okay that means that means
 

2893
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:47,109
okay that means that means
that if you fail a roll you can choose

2894
01:01:47,109 --> 01:01:47,119
that if you fail a roll you can choose
 

2895
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:48,630
that if you fail a roll you can choose
to make it extra bad

2896
01:01:48,630 --> 01:01:48,640
to make it extra bad
 

2897
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,470
to make it extra bad
a really bad situation but you will get

2898
01:01:50,470 --> 01:01:50,480
a really bad situation but you will get
 

2899
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:53,829
a really bad situation but you will get
a beat for it

2900
01:01:53,829 --> 01:01:53,839
a beat for it
 

2901
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:56,870
a beat for it
okay let's see and if your character

2902
01:01:56,870 --> 01:01:56,880
okay let's see and if your character
 

2903
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:00,549
okay let's see and if your character
takes lethal damage um then you take a

2904
01:02:00,549 --> 01:02:00,559
takes lethal damage um then you take a
 

2905
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:01,109
takes lethal damage um then you take a
beat

2906
01:02:01,109 --> 01:02:01,119
beat
 

2907
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:03,349
beat
in one of the rightmost health boxes so

2908
01:02:03,349 --> 01:02:03,359
in one of the rightmost health boxes so
 

2909
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:05,190
in one of the rightmost health boxes so
when you're taking lethal damage

2910
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:05,200
when you're taking lethal damage
 

2911
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:08,309
when you're taking lethal damage
towards the the end like towards the

2912
01:02:08,309 --> 01:02:08,319
towards the the end like towards the
 

2913
01:02:08,319 --> 01:02:09,670
towards the the end like towards the
part where it gets yeah bye

2914
01:02:09,670 --> 01:02:09,680
part where it gets yeah bye
 

2915
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:12,710
part where it gets yeah bye
then you'll take one beat um

2916
01:02:12,710 --> 01:02:12,720
then you'll take one beat um
 

2917
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,630
then you'll take one beat um
and let's see then at the end of any

2918
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:14,640
and let's see then at the end of any
 

2919
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,230
and let's see then at the end of any
game session take a beat that's one you

2920
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:16,240
game session take a beat that's one you
 

2921
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,470
game session take a beat that's one you
get for free anyway

2922
01:02:18,470 --> 01:02:18,480
get for free anyway
 

2923
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,549
get for free anyway
all right and those are the ones those

2924
01:02:20,549 --> 01:02:20,559
all right and those are the ones those
 

2925
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:21,990
all right and those are the ones those
are the ones that are

2926
01:02:21,990 --> 01:02:22,000
are the ones that are
 

2927
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,910
are the ones that are
in the book essentially except for two

2928
01:02:23,910 --> 01:02:23,920
in the book essentially except for two
 

2929
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:26,230
in the book essentially except for two
that i omitted um

2930
01:02:26,230 --> 01:02:26,240
that i omitted um
 

2931
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:29,270
that i omitted um
and finally one home brew one

2932
01:02:29,270 --> 01:02:29,280
and finally one home brew one
 

2933
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:32,069
and finally one home brew one
is good role playing if you role played

then i also have one more

2944
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:44,480
then i also have one more
 

2945
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:47,430
then i also have one more
homebrew one um if you accomplish the

2946
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:47,440
homebrew one um if you accomplish the
 

2947
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:47,990
homebrew one um if you accomplish the
mission

2948

like brownie points oh nice yeah exactly
 

2955
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:58,390
like brownie points oh nice yeah exactly
yep and those those are the beats that

2956
01:02:58,390 --> 01:02:58,400
yep and those those are the beats that
 

2957
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:59,430
yep and those those are the beats that
you can get

2958
01:02:59,430 --> 01:02:59,440
you can get
 

2959
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:02,630
you can get
um and essentially uh you can get you

2960
01:03:02,630 --> 01:03:02,640
um and essentially uh you can get you
 

2961
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,390
um and essentially uh you can get you
can use them to get experience

2962
01:03:04,390 --> 01:03:04,400
can use them to get experience
 

2963
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:08,150
can use them to get experience
so essentially um you can get

2964
01:03:08,150 --> 01:03:08,160
so essentially um you can get
 

2965
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:11,910
so essentially um you can get
like a merit skill um or attribute

2966
01:03:11,910 --> 01:03:11,920
like a merit skill um or attribute
 

2967
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,670
like a merit skill um or attribute
they all cost different experience

2968
01:03:13,670 --> 01:03:13,680
they all cost different experience
 

2969
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:15,510
they all cost different experience
points okay

2970
01:03:15,510 --> 01:03:15,520
points okay
 

2971
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:18,390
points okay
um i've kind of okay i've kind of uh

2972
01:03:18,390 --> 01:03:18,400
um i've kind of okay i've kind of uh
 

2973
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,710
um i've kind of okay i've kind of uh
tweaked how many beats you need for each

2974
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:20,720
tweaked how many beats you need for each
 

2975
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:21,829
tweaked how many beats you need for each
point of experience

2976
01:03:21,829 --> 01:03:21,839
point of experience
 

2977
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:24,950
point of experience
uh to fit the length of this game

2978
01:03:24,950 --> 01:03:24,960
uh to fit the length of this game
 

2979
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:28,230
uh to fit the length of this game
um essentially it's three just because

2980
01:03:28,230 --> 01:03:28,240
um essentially it's three just because
 

2981
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:29,750
um essentially it's three just because
we're only gonna have five to six

2982
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:29,760
we're only gonna have five to six
 

2983
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,430
we're only gonna have five to six
sessions so

2984
01:03:31,430 --> 01:03:31,440
sessions so
 

2985
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,270
sessions so
usually i believe it would be five i

2986
01:03:33,270 --> 01:03:33,280
usually i believe it would be five i
 

2987
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:34,710
usually i believe it would be five i
think it's five let me see

2988
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:34,720

just because the way that battles often
end up going

4158
01:27:09,430 --> 01:27:09,440
end up going
 

4159
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:12,149
end up going
there's not a million turns anyway i

4160
01:27:12,149 --> 01:27:12,159
there's not a million turns anyway i
 

4161
01:27:12,159 --> 01:27:13,590
there's not a million turns anyway i
don't like there to be a million turns

4162
01:27:13,590 --> 01:27:13,600
don't like there to be a million turns
 

4163
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:15,430
don't like there to be a million turns
because it really drags out the game

4164
01:27:15,430 --> 01:27:15,440
because it really drags out the game
 

4165
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:18,629
because it really drags out the game
um so i don't really uh

4166
01:27:18,629 --> 01:27:18,639
um so i don't really uh
 

4167
01:27:18,639 --> 01:27:20,950
um so i don't really uh
focus too much on ammo um in this game

4168
01:27:20,950 --> 01:27:20,960
focus too much on ammo um in this game
 

4169
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:21,750
focus too much on ammo um in this game
so you're fine

4170
01:27:21,750 --> 01:27:21,760
so you're fine
 

4171
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:24,709
so you're fine
don't worry it's pretty much infinite

4172
01:27:24,709 --> 01:27:24,719
don't worry it's pretty much infinite
 

4173
01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:25,430
don't worry it's pretty much infinite
