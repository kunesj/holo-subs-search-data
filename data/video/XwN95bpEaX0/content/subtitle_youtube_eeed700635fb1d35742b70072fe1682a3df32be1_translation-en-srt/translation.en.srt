669
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:26,430

[Laughs] It's

670
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:26,440

 

671
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:30,669

difficult, but if I hear this, I can do it.

672
00:28:30,669 --> 00:28:30,679
difficult, but if I hear this, I can do it.
 

673
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:33,669
difficult, but if I hear this, I can do it.
Well, I understand it perfectly now.

674
00:28:33,669 --> 00:28:33,679
Well, I understand it perfectly now.
 

675
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,509
Well, I understand it perfectly now.
Well, wait a minute.

676
00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:42,990
Well, wait a minute.
 

677
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:46,070

679
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,389

What I mean by that is that the red team is the hunter at first, and the white team all run away. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, but everyone is a contestant.

680
00:28:48,389 --> 00:28:48,399

Well then,
 

683
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:55,430
Well then,
that's what the white team's hunting is.  In the case of , the infected person and the

684
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:55,440
that's what the white team's hunting is.  In the case of , the infected person and the
 

685
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,070
that's what the white team's hunting is.  In the case of , the infected person and the
hunter will probably be separated.That's

686
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:58,080
hunter will probably be separated.That's
 

687
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:05,350
hunter will probably be separated.That's
right.

688
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:11,710

 

689
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:11,720

to South Korea. I'm going to South Korea.
 

734
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:58,310

Unexpectedly, the back of the cage is a hiding place because it can't get

735
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:00,830
Unexpectedly, the back of the cage is a hiding place because it can't get
 

736

737
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,430

out.Oh yeah, I'm a little anti-Ah, no one.On

the other hand, I'm going to go to the wide side of the opposite side of the cage, so

740
00:31:07,789 --> 00:31:07,799
the other hand, I'm going to go to the wide side of the opposite side of the cage, so
 

741
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:12,470
the other hand, I'm going to go to the wide side of the opposite side of the cage, so
who's behind the cage?  I don't have any  It's the

742
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:12,480
who's behind the cage?  I don't have any  It's the
 

743
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,269
who's behind the cage?  I don't have any  It's the
same behind the pillar of the swing.

744
00:31:16,269 --> 00:31:16,279
same behind the pillar of the swing.
 

745
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:18,909
same behind the pillar of the swing.
There's something I'm a little concerned about. I wonder

746
00:31:18,909 --> 00:31:18,919
There's something I'm a little concerned about. I wonder
 

747
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:23,110
There's something I'm a little concerned about. I wonder
if that's what the staff is talking about right now. I

748
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:23,120
if that's what the staff is talking about right now. I
 

749
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,230
if that's what the staff is talking about right now. I
'm watching the text channel, and the

'm watching the text channel, and the
7 escapees in the white group are contestants, so it's probably the 2nd one.  That's right,

752
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:32,240
7 escapees in the white group are contestants, so it's probably the 2nd one.  That's right,
 

753
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,509
7 escapees in the white group are contestants, so it's probably the 2nd one.  That's right,
but I guess it's better to go there, because Bai-

754
00:31:35,509 --> 00:31:35,519
but I guess it's better to go there, because Bai-
 

755

but I guess it's better to go there, because Bai-
chan didn't call me that by name.That's

756
00:31:38,389 --> 00:31:38,399
chan didn't call me that by name.That's
 

757
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:39,789
chan didn't call me that by name.That's
right, that's right.That's why the

right, that's right.That's why the
 

759
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:42,470

people from both the first and second hunting competitions

760
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:42,480
people from both the first and second hunting competitions
 

761
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,990
people from both the first and second hunting competitions
went over there.  Maybe it's better?  I'm

762
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:45,000
went over there.  Maybe it's better?  I'm
 

763
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,389
went over there.  Maybe it's better?  I'm
having a bit of a hard time thinking about it. That one is

764
00:31:48,389 --> 00:31:51,190
having a bit of a hard time thinking about it. That one is
 

765
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:51,200

 

766
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,389

better than that, but I was also called 'Kan', but I guess they haven't conveyed that to me. Ah-chan's is like that.

767
00:31:55,389 --> 00:31:58,509
better than that, but I was also called 'Kan', but I guess they haven't conveyed that to me. Ah-chan's is like that.

769
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:01,789

Yeah, that's what I see. I feel like it's something like that.  I'll

775
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,310

there's something for Laren-chan.  Someone was

776
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:13,320
there's something for Laren-chan.  Someone was
 

777
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:17,470
there's something for Laren-chan.  Someone was
called out earlier, but I guess they're still

778
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:17,480
called out earlier, but I guess they're still
 

779
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,750
called out earlier, but I guess they're still
going ahead with the idea of ​​Raden-chan joining in. I

780
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:22,310
going ahead with the idea of ​​Raden-chan joining in. I

00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:27,600
have a feeling that's the case, right? That's right. If
 

784

that's the case, it's

that's the case, it's
 

786
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:33,230
that's the case, it's
only for people who aren't really hunters.  I feel like I have to be on this channel right now,

only for people who aren't really hunters.  I feel like I have to be on this channel right now,

802
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,789

you very much. Thank you very much.  I don't think

803
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:19,799
you very much. Thank you very much.  I don't think
 

804
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:21,190
you very much. Thank you very much.  I don't think
so. I

805
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:21,200
so. I
 

806
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,710
so. I
guess there are some materials that I don't think were there right now, and I'm

807
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:25,720
guess there are some materials that I don't think were there right now, and I'm
 

808
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,629
guess there are some materials that I don't think were there right now, and I'm
reading this right now and it

809
00:33:28,629 --> 00:33:28,639
reading this right now and it
 

810
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:31,909
reading this right now and it
says that even if you're not a contestant, you can probably do it.  It

811
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:31,919
says that even if you're not a contestant, you can probably do it.  It
 

812
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:35,310
says that even if you're not a contestant, you can probably do it.  It
says "except for the contestants from other teams,"

813
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:35,320
says "except for the contestants from other teams,"
 

814
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:39,110
says "except for the contestants from other teams,"
so that's it. That's the confusion. I'm so excited.

815
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:39,120

climbed up like that. You didn't even stop, nice and nice.

climbed up like that. You didn't even stop, nice and nice.
That's nice, that's

2713
01:46:34,599 --> 01:46:37,550
nice, that's good, that's too good, because we
haven't reached the 2nd and 3rd place goal yet.  I

2714
01:46:37,550 --> 01:46:40,030
haven't reached the 2nd and 3rd place goal yet.  I
 

2715
01:46:40,030 --> 01:46:40,040

 

2716
01:46:40,040 --> 01:46:41,510


2717
01:46:41,510 --> 01:46:41,520

 

2718
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:46,550

got about 90 with my money, so I took a look. It looks

2719

got about 90 with my money, so I took a look. It looks
like I'm going to take a look. It's really fast.

2721
01:46:52,669 --> 01:46:52,679
like I'm going to take a look. It's really fast.
 

2722

01:47:06,390 --> 01:47:06,400
true that you and Mr. Ago are competing against each other. Oh,
 

2727

true that you and Mr. Ago are competing against each other. Oh,
black is falling.

2728
01:47:10,270 --> 01:47:10,280
black is falling.
 

2729
01:47:10,280 --> 01:47:14,830
black is falling.
Black is amazing. That's what I thought. I died.  It's really difficult,

2730
01:47:14,830 --> 01:47:14,840
Black is amazing. That's what I thought. I died.  It's really difficult,
 

2731
01:47:14,840 --> 01:47:19,310
Black is amazing. That's what I thought. I died.  It's really difficult,
and the same goes for the sense of distance. I

2732
01:47:19,310 --> 01:47:19,320
and the same goes for the sense of distance. I
 

2733
01:47:19,320 --> 01:47:24,589
and the same goes for the sense of distance. I
really practiced this, so it's the result of all my hard work

2734
01:47:24,589 --> 01:47:24,599
really practiced this, so it's the result of all my hard work
 

2735
01:47:24,599 --> 01:47:27,790
really practiced this, so it's the result of all my hard work
. It looks like I practiced for a really long time yesterday.

2736
01:47:27,790 --> 01:47:29,390
. It looks like I practiced for a really long time yesterday.
 

2737
01:47:29,390 --> 01:47:32,830

 

2738
01:47:32,830 --> 01:47:32,840

 

2739
01:47:32,840 --> 01:47:38,470

That's amazing. There's only one person here.

01:47:38,480 --> 01:47:47,950

So

2748
01:48:03,229 --> 01:48:08,750

2754
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:24,550

saw an amazing moment. It

2755
01:48:24,550 --> 01:48:28,390
saw an amazing moment. It
 

2756
01:48:28,390 --> 01:48:28,400

 

2757
01:48:28,400 --> 01:48:44,120

was interrupted for a moment. It was an amazing battle.

2758
01:48:44,120 --> 01:48:44,130

 

2759
01:48:44,130 --> 01:48:49,189


2760
01:48:49,189 --> 01:48:49,199

 

2761
01:48:49,199 --> 01:48:52,149


2762
01:48:52,149 --> 01:48:58,629

 

2763
01:48:58,629 --> 01:49:02,430

01:49:02,430 --> 01:49:02,440

 

2765
01:49:02,440 --> 01:49:07,470

However, since we

2766
01:49:07,470 --> 01:49:07,480
However, since we
 

2767
01:49:07,480 --> 01:49:10,629
However, since we
finished 12th, I think this

2768
01:49:10,629 --> 01:49:10,639
finished 12th, I think this
 

2769
01:49:10,639 --> 01:49:12,669
finished 12th, I think this
follow-up probably has the highest points.

2770
01:49:12,669 --> 01:49:15,070
follow-up probably has the highest points.
 

2771
01:49:15,070 --> 01:49:19,109

01:49:19,119 --> 01:49:21,189


2774
01:49:21,189 --> 01:49:22,910

 

2775
01:49:22,910 --> 01:49:22,920

 

2776
01:49:22,920 --> 01:49:24,510

If this is the point of flow up, the

2780

If this is the point of flow up, the
 

2781
01:49:32,199 --> 01:49:34,830
If this is the point of flow up, the
white group's points are now 20 and the number 1

2782
01:49:34,830 --> 01:49:34,840
white group's points are now 20 and the number 1
 

2783
01:49:34,840 --> 01:49:37,750
white group's points are now 20 and the number 1
point has come out, so it's probably Ron number one.

2784
01:49:37,750 --> 01:49:42,390
point has come out, so it's probably Ron number one.

if you get the most successful kill, you'll

3078
02:00:55,830 --> 02:00:55,840
if you get the most successful kill, you'll
 

3079
02:00:55,840 --> 02:00:58,109
if you get the most successful kill, you'll
get 1 point added, so the

get 1 point added, so the
 

3081
02:00:58,119 --> 02:01:02,109
get 1 point added, so the
opponent you can protect and probably attack is the enemy.  Let's
