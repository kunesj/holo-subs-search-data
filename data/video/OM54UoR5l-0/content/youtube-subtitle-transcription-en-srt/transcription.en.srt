I don't see a problem in that and maybe

3888
02:03:59,310 --> 02:03:59,320
I don't see a problem in that and maybe
 

3889
02:03:59,320 --> 02:04:01,189
I don't see a problem in that and maybe
less people would be running around if

3890
02:04:01,189 --> 02:04:01,199
less people would be running around if
 

3891
02:04:01,199 --> 02:04:04,790
less people would be running around if

there's enough people who want to make
use of it then of course it makes

3898
02:04:14,950 --> 02:04:14,960
use of it then of course it makes
 

3899
02:04:14,960 --> 02:04:17,510
use of it then of course it makes
