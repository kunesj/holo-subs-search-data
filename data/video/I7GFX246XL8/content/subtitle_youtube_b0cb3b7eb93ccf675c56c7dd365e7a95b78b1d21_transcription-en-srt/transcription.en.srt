melatonin yeah it doesn't really work
that well on me but um makes sense it's

4724
01:57:55,910 --> 01:57:55,920
that well on me but um makes sense it's
 

4725
01:57:55,920 --> 01:57:58,589
that well on me but um makes sense it's
kind of like iffy I'll still take it

4726
01:57:58,589 --> 01:57:58,599
kind of like iffy I'll still take it
 

4727
01:57:58,599 --> 01:58:00,589
kind of like iffy I'll still take it
hoping that it will work yeah maybe you

4728
01:58:00,589 --> 01:58:00,599
hoping that it will work yeah maybe you
 

4729
01:58:00,599 --> 01:58:03,069
hoping that it will work yeah maybe you
can get those uh heated eye mask maybe

4730
01:58:03,069 --> 01:58:03,079
can get those uh heated eye mask maybe
 

4731
01:58:03,079 --> 01:58:04,910
can get those uh heated eye mask maybe
that can help you ah I think I still

4732
