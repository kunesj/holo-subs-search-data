1370
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:40,480
membership there apparently you can get
 

1371
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,549
membership there apparently you can get

1393
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,470
and he says he doesn't know if this is
like a one-time thing it was a two-time

1394
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:06,480
like a one-time thing it was a two-time
 

1395
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,550
like a one-time thing it was a two-time
thing that's for sure

1396
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:08,560
thing that's for sure
 

1397
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,310
thing that's for sure
it happened two times

1398
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:10,320
it happened two times
 

1399
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,829
it happened two times
right it didn't break down at that

1400
00:34:11,829 --> 00:34:11,839

1405
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,990
lane or whatever very quickly so that's
why it didn't happen who knows what

1406
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:18,000
why it didn't happen who knows what

and
 

1513
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:21,349
and
then my friend spontaneously decided to

1514
00:36:21,349 --> 00:36:21,359
then my friend spontaneously decided to
 

1515
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,829
then my friend spontaneously decided to
make her own membership to get that

1516
00:36:23,829 --> 00:36:23,839
make her own membership to get that
 

1517
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:25,829
make her own membership to get that
 extra car because we didn't want

1518
00:36:25,829 --> 00:36:25,839
extra car because we didn't want
 

1519
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:27,990
extra car because we didn't want
to use the old car anymore

00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:28,000
to use the old car anymore
 

1521
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,069
to use the old car anymore
so she made a membership that also took

1522
00:36:30,069 --> 00:36:30,079
so she made a membership that also took
 

1523
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:31,109
so she made a membership that also took
time

1524
00:36:31,109 --> 00:36:31,119
time
 

1525
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,910
time
and we paid for it and then she uh we

1526
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:33,920
and we paid for it and then she uh we
 

1527
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,550
and we paid for it and then she uh we
got the car and we inspected the car and

and then we finally left off again

1532
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:44,000

 

1533

00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,349
for this bath
by the way it is not the pool that you

2366
00:55:07,349 --> 00:55:07,359
by the way it is not the pool that you
 

2367
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:09,990
by the way it is not the pool that you
see right there on in the back i thought

2368
00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:10,000
see right there on in the back i thought
 

2369
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,750
see right there on in the back i thought
that first because it's right next to it

2370
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:11,760
that first because it's right next to it
 

2371
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,710
that first because it's right next to it
logical thinking but it's not that but

2372
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:14,720
logical thinking but it's not that but
 

2373
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:17,109
logical thinking but it's not that but
in the beginning we thought so logically

2374
00:55:17,109 --> 00:55:17,119
in the beginning we thought so logically
 

2375
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:19,430
in the beginning we thought so logically
because it's right there we thought that

2376
00:55:19,430 --> 00:55:19,440
because it's right there we thought that
 

2377
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,349
because it's right there we thought that
that's their onsen so

2378
00:55:21,349 --> 00:55:21,359
that's their onsen so
 

2379
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:23,190
that's their onsen so
after washing us

2380
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:23,200

2477
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,030

2479
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,270

00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,510

like divided but here i guess it makes

2482
00:57:59,510 --> 00:57:59,520
like divided but here i guess it makes
 

2483
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,270
like divided but here i guess it makes
sense because you wear your swimsuit so

2484
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:01,280
sense because you wear your swimsuit so
 

2485
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,510
sense because you wear your swimsuit so
that it's also mixed so that's okay but

2486
00:58:03,510 --> 00:58:03,520
that it's also mixed so that's okay but
 

2487
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,950
