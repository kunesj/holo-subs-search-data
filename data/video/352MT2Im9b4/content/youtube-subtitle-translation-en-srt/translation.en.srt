sorry, Mizu-chan, that it turned out like this, but I'll try to cook it as low as possible. Hmm, here it is. I don't need any of it. No, I don't have this one, black

just had a group of people.

so I messed with it a little bit. I was like, ``This is this, this is Taro, 9 I'm like this, this is this 9, this is this nice.'' But after a while, Saho and this will go away. So if I leave it as a guide, it gets mixed in with Sui-chan.

room light for 7 minutes, so I've had to struggle

270
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,130
room light for 7 minutes, so I've had to struggle
 

271
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,070
room light for 7 minutes, so I've had to struggle
a few times with the nuts. I

272
00:09:59,070 --> 00:09:59,080
a few times with the nuts. I
 

273
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,500
a few times with the nuts. I
tried to make the elegance blur,

274
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:01,510
tried to make the elegance blur,
 

275
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,730

00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:03,740
but I'm
 

277
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,910
but I'm
getting drunk.  I

278
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:05,920
getting drunk.  I
 

279
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,829
getting drunk.  I
tried making it a little bit brighter. I

280
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:10,110

284
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:14,610

think it's a lot brighter. How do you

285
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:14,620
think it's a lot brighter. How do you
 

286
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:19,120

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:00,730
like pulling up the carpet. I'll
 

315
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:04,319
like pulling up the carpet. I'll
think about how to do it in the south. I'd

316
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,840
think about how to do it in the south. I'd
 

317
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:05,850

 

318
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:09,730

be tomorrow. I guess

321
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:13,270
be tomorrow. I guess
 

322
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,660

I'm also kind of like that. I

326
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:19,390
I'm also kind of like that. I
 

327
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:22,200
I'm also kind of like that. I
talked about it being a bit of a monster, but all I

00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:22,210
talked about it being a bit of a monster, but all I
 

329
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:24,660
talked about it being a bit of a monster, but all I
heard was that it was going to the en server.

337
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,320

going around a little more slowly, and

338
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:35,330
going around a little more slowly, and
 

339
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:39,160
going around a little more slowly, and
in between, we'll have a little more casual chat, and then once we're

340
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:39,170
in between, we'll have a little more casual chat, and then once we're
 

341
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:42,010
in between, we'll have a little more casual chat, and then once we're
done, we'll have a little more 4-hour chat.  times first 8 days  I

342

done, we'll have a little more 4-hour chat.  times first 8 days  I
 

343
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:45,520
done, we'll have a little more 4-hour chat.  times first 8 days  I
think it's because I want to go there, so I guess it's

344
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:45,530
think it's because I want to go there, so I guess it's
 

345
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:48,670
think it's because I want to go there, so I guess it's
only an hour or two, so I

346
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,759
only an hour or two, so I
 

347
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:53,249

 

348
00:11:53,249 --> 00:11:53,259

 

349
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:55,169

guess it's okay if I can't go around that much.I don't know, maybe not,

350
00:11:55,169 --> 00:11:55,179
guess it's okay if I can't go around that much.I don't know, maybe not,
 

351
00:11:55,179 --> 00:11:57,929
guess it's okay if I can't go around that much.I don't know, maybe not,
but I don't know what I'll do until then.  I

352
00:11:57,929 --> 00:11:57,939
but I don't know what I'll do until then.  I
 

353
00:11:57,939 --> 00:11:59,970
but I don't know what I'll do until then.  I
was listening to everyone,

354
00:11:59,970 --> 00:11:59,980
was listening to everyone,
 

355
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:03,810
was listening to everyone,
and that's right, Hakuken said that they were all going tomorrow.Mikochi

356

00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,600
and that's right, Hakuken said that they were all going tomorrow.Mikochi
said that she wanted to go with everyone, but I almost

358
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:06,610
said that she wanted to go with everyone, but I almost
 

359
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:09,150
said that she wanted to go with everyone, but I almost
decided to go, but all of them said that.

360

Salmon: That's what he said,
 

363
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,450
Salmon: That's what he said,
so I think I'll probably have a lot of time to go around it slowly, and I'll do it tomorrow.The

364
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:15,460
so I think I'll probably have a lot of time to go around it slowly, and I'll do it tomorrow.The
 

365
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,850
so I think I'll probably have a lot of time to go around it slowly, and I'll do it tomorrow.The
same goes for the ladle, which

366
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:17,860
same goes for the ladle, which
 

367
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,850
same goes for the ladle, which
will go around as much as I feel after putting it on.

368
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,110

Hey, I did
n't see anything except that shape, and

373
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:27,740
n't see anything except that shape, and
 

374
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,400
n't see anything except that shape, and
after everyone looked at it carefully, I thought I'd go to sleep because the temperature

375
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:30,410
after everyone looked at it carefully, I thought I'd go to sleep because the temperature

inside that Mr. Okurawood, a manned hair carver of Kido, is
 

378
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,890
inside that Mr. Okurawood, a manned hair carver of Kido, is
going to be strange.  I was

379
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:35,900
going to be strange.  I was
 

380
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,020
going to be strange.  I was
worried that the temperature would be weird, so I thought it would be better to

381
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:41,800
worried that the temperature would be weird, so I thought it would be better to
 

382

slowly admit it first,
 

385
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,940
slowly admit it first,
because it's a car that attracts a lot of people, so why

386
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:45,950
because it's a car that attracts a lot of people, so why
 

387
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,830
because it's a car that attracts a lot of people, so why
not buy it and become a chama-chan?

388
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:47,840
not buy it and become a chama-chan?
 

389

671
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:09,230

if everyone left a flyer or something. I'm going to middle school alone, so I don't feel like bringing any flyers with me,

672
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:09,240
if everyone left a flyer or something. I'm going to middle school alone, so I don't feel like bringing any flyers with me,

I, who has a little communication disorder, would be like that.  I guess I'm
 

737
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,240
I, who has a little communication disorder, would be like that.  I guess I'm
just trying not to make it look like it's just a job I bought,

738
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:42,250
just trying not to make it look like it's just a job I bought,
 

739
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:45,090
just trying not to make it look like it's just a job I bought,
but of course I'm a woman who has a plan in mind, so I

don't meet anyone, then
 

746
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,960
don't meet anyone, then
that's fine.  But I met someone

747
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:54,970
that's fine.  But I met someone

760
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,430

so it's Senda, so what

so it's Senda, so what
 

762
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:18,150

 

763
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:20,510
