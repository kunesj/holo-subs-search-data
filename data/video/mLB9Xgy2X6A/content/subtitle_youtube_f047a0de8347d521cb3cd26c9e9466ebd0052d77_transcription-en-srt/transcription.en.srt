I didn't want it to reveal too much of

1388
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:52,740
I didn't want it to reveal too much of
 

1389
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,290
I didn't want it to reveal too much of
the outfit yet because I was gonna show

1390
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:54,300
the outfit yet because I was gonna show
 

1391
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,750
the outfit yet because I was gonna show
it before actually showing the outfit so

1392
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:56,760
it before actually showing the outfit so
 

1393
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,870
it before actually showing the outfit so
I didn't want it to give away everything

1394
00:39:58,870 --> 00:39:58,880
I didn't want it to give away everything
 

1395
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,569
I didn't want it to give away everything
uh so I was like sketching out scenes

1396
00:40:02,569 --> 00:40:02,579
uh so I was like sketching out scenes
 

1397
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:05,750
uh so I was like sketching out scenes
and thinking of scenes where you could

1398
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:05,760
and thinking of scenes where you could
 

1399
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,930
and thinking of scenes where you could
you see something some stuff is going on

1400
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:08,940
you see something some stuff is going on
 

1401
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,550
you see something some stuff is going on
but you don't see everything clearly so

1402
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:10,560
but you don't see everything clearly so
 

1403
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,430
but you don't see everything clearly so
it's more like close-ups of the hand

1404
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:12,440
it's more like close-ups of the hand
 

1405
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:16,609
it's more like close-ups of the hand
close-ups of the eyes close-ups of the

1406
00:40:16,609 --> 00:40:16,619
close-ups of the eyes close-ups of the

the end we did have a couple of like

1410
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:23,280
the end we did have a couple of like
 

1411
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,270
the end we did have a couple of like
pretty full clear views shots as well

1412
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:26,280
pretty full clear views shots as well
 

1413
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,790
pretty full clear views shots as well
but they were fast and in the end you

1414
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:28,800
but they were fast and in the end you
 

1415
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,930
but they were fast and in the end you
know it's black and white and everything

1416
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:29,940
know it's black and white and everything
 

1417
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,670
know it's black and white and everything
so I guess it wasn't like too much of a

1418
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:31,680
so I guess it wasn't like too much of a
 

1419
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,050
so I guess it wasn't like too much of a
problem right

1420
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:33,060
problem right
 

1421
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:36,650

but here is the the next one so

1422
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:36,660
but here is the the next one so
 

1423
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:39,589

1656
00:46:06,650 --> 00:46:06,660
and then we have the last this I think
 

1657
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:08,930
and then we have the last this I think
the last one

1658
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:08,940
the last one
 

1659
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:10,670
the last one
