because like my vocabulary in english is

934
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:51,520
because like my vocabulary in english is
 

935
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,030
because like my vocabulary in english is
not as good as obviously

936
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:53,040
not as good as obviously
 

937
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,990

00:50:55,990 --> 00:50:56,000
my german vocabulary so for translating
 

939
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,069
my german vocabulary so for translating
it to german was actually

940
00:50:58,069 --> 00:50:58,079
it to german was actually
 

941
00:50:58,079 --> 00:50:59,829
it to german was actually
yeah not not as hard as i thought it

942
00:50:59,829 --> 00:50:59,839
yeah not not as hard as i thought it
 

943
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:01,990
yeah not not as hard as i thought it
would be it was still hard because

944
00:51:01,990 --> 00:51:02,000
would be it was still hard because
 

945
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,750
would be it was still hard because
i still wanted it to sound like you know

946
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:03,760
i still wanted it to sound like you know
 

947
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,910
i still wanted it to sound like you know
not like a direct translation

948
00:51:05,910 --> 00:51:05,920
not like a direct translation
 

949
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,069
not like a direct translation
but actually like something that you

950
00:51:08,069 --> 00:51:08,079
but actually like something that you
 

951
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:09,589
but actually like something that you
would sing

952
00:51:09,589 --> 00:51:09,599
would sing
 

953
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:12,069
would sing
and so the choice of words really

954
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:12,079
and so the choice of words really
 

955
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:13,340
and so the choice of words really
matters

956
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:13,350
matters
 

957
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:14,630

3132
01:55:26,390 --> 01:55:26,400
and i think that might actually really
 

3133
01:55:26,400 --> 01:55:28,390
and i think that might actually really
be a thing yeah

3134
01:55:28,390 --> 01:55:28,400
be a thing yeah
 

3135
01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:32,149
be a thing yeah
because on the last uh few days

3136
01:55:32,149 --> 01:55:32,159
because on the last uh few days

like you know packing uh i was also
able to wake up earlier i think it

3142
01:55:41,830 --> 01:55:41,840
able to wake up earlier i think it
 

3143
01:55:41,840 --> 01:55:44,550
able to wake up earlier i think it
really is a thing yeah

3144
01:55:44,550 --> 01:55:44,560

yeah so that's probably one of the

3148
01:55:50,870 --> 01:55:50,880
yeah so that's probably one of the
 

3149
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:53,669
yeah so that's probably one of the
reasons why i've been

3150
01:55:53,669 --> 01:55:53,679
reasons why i've been
 

3151
01:55:53,679 --> 01:55:56,310
reasons why i've been
sleeping so early and falling asleep so

3152
01:55:56,310 --> 01:55:56,320
sleeping so early and falling asleep so
 

3153
01:55:56,320 --> 01:55:58,830
sleeping so early and falling asleep so
early

3154
01:55:58,830 --> 01:55:58,840

 

3155
01:55:58,840 --> 01:56:01,030

uh that's the same thing

3156
01:56:01,030 --> 01:56:01,040
uh that's the same thing
 

3157
01:56:01,040 --> 01:56:04,070
uh that's the same thing
what uh sleeping early and waking up

3158
01:56:04,070 --> 01:56:04,080
what uh sleeping early and waking up
 

3159
01:56:04,080 --> 01:56:05,030
what uh sleeping early and waking up
early

3160
01:56:05,030 --> 01:56:05,040
early
 

3161
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:07,270
early
although i mean sleeping early has

3162
01:56:07,270 --> 01:56:07,280
although i mean sleeping early has
 

3163
01:56:07,280 --> 01:56:08,390
although i mean sleeping early has
nothing to do with that because it's

3164
01:56:08,390 --> 01:56:08,400
nothing to do with that because it's
 

3165
01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:09,669
nothing to do with that because it's
already dark

3166
01:56:09,669 --> 01:56:09,679
already dark
 

3167
01:56:09,679 --> 01:56:12,229
already dark
i i don't know why i'm able to fall
