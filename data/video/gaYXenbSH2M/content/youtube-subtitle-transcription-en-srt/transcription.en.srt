bgm it's fun I like these kind of sneaky
 

7381
03:34:05,960 --> 03:34:08,429
bgm it's fun I like these kind of sneaky
games as you may know I always like the

7382
03:34:08,429 --> 03:34:08,439
games as you may know I always like the
 

7383
03:34:08,439 --> 03:34:10,630
games as you may know I always like the
sneaky parts of other games too so this

7384
03:34:10,630 --> 03:34:10,640
sneaky parts of other games too so this
 

7385
03:34:10,640 --> 03:34:15,030
sneaky parts of other games too so this
is kind of my jam and I feel like last

7386
03:34:15,030 --> 03:34:15,040
is kind of my jam and I feel like last
 

7387
03:34:15,040 --> 03:34:16,469
is kind of my jam and I feel like last
time I played this game I was a bit more

7388
03:34:16,469 --> 03:34:16,479
time I played this game I was a bit more
 

7389
03:34:16,479 --> 03:34:20,750
time I played this game I was a bit more
freaked out but um maybe that was also

7390
03:34:20,750 --> 03:34:20,760
freaked out but um maybe that was also
 

7391
03:34:20,760 --> 03:34:22,550
freaked out but um maybe that was also
just because I was in the higher levels

7392
03:34:22,550 --> 03:34:22,560
just because I was in the higher levels
 

7393
03:34:22,560 --> 03:34:25,030
just because I was in the higher levels
and then it gets like way more difficult

7394
03:34:25,030 --> 03:34:25,040
and then it gets like way more difficult
 

7395
03:34:25,040 --> 03:34:26,510
and then it gets like way more difficult
you guys are already saying back then I

7396
03:34:26,510 --> 03:34:26,520

7404
03:34:34,550 --> 03:34:34,560
this
 

7405
03:34:34,560 --> 03:34:37,269
this
week uh I was thinking about what to

7406
03:34:37,269 --> 03:34:37,279
week uh I was thinking about what to
 

7407
03:34:37,279 --> 03:34:42,469
week uh I was thinking about what to
play next and I don't know it's

either the Witcher
 

7411
03:34:45,920 --> 03:34:48,309
either the Witcher
which makes sense cuz I just um still

7412
03:34:48,309 --> 03:34:48,319
which makes sense cuz I just um still
 

7413
03:34:48,319 --> 03:34:51,070
which makes sense cuz I just um still
have it on my

7414
03:34:51,070 --> 03:34:51,080

 

7415
03:34:51,080 --> 03:34:54,070

brain uh cuz I just watched the whole

7416
03:34:54,070 --> 03:34:54,080
brain uh cuz I just watched the whole
 

7417
03:34:54,080 --> 03:34:59,389
brain uh cuz I just watched the whole
show um but then the one thought I have

7418
03:34:59,389 --> 03:34:59,399
show um but then the one thought I have
 

7419
03:34:59,399 --> 03:35:02,630
show um but then the one thought I have
is it's kind of stupid like unnecessary

7420
03:35:02,630 --> 03:35:02,640
is it's kind of stupid like unnecessary
 

7421
03:35:02,640 --> 03:35:04,429
is it's kind of stupid like unnecessary
like I don't have to like pay attention

7422
03:35:04,429 --> 03:35:04,439
like I don't have to like pay attention
 

7423
03:35:04,439 --> 03:35:06,990
like I don't have to like pay attention
to that but just thinking because fauna

7424
03:35:06,990 --> 03:35:07,000
to that but just thinking because fauna
 

7425
03:35:07,000 --> 03:35:10,229
to that but just thinking because fauna
just started it it's like why why have

7426
03:35:10,229 --> 03:35:10,239
just started it it's like why why have
 

7427
03:35:10,239 --> 03:35:12,990
just started it it's like why why have
two of these playthroughs running

7428
03:35:12,990 --> 03:35:13,000
two of these playthroughs running
 

7429
03:35:13,000 --> 03:35:14,710
two of these playthroughs running
simultaneous it makes sense when a game

7430
03:35:14,710 --> 03:35:14,720
simultaneous it makes sense when a game
 

7431
03:35:14,720 --> 03:35:17,429
simultaneous it makes sense when a game
just comes out just releases and then

7432
03:35:17,429 --> 03:35:17,439
just comes out just releases and then
 

7433
