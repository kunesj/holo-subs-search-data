2919
01:42:08,199 --> 01:42:10,470
me usually I mean I don't even care that
much because yeah there's some different

2920
01:42:10,470 --> 01:42:10,480
much because yeah there's some different
 

2921
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:12,589
much because yeah there's some different
Pokémon but not that many different

2922
01:42:12,589 --> 01:42:12,599
Pokémon but not that many different
 

2923

Pokémon and in the end the story is the
 

2925
01:42:14,520 --> 01:42:16,870

2927
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:19,750
same if the story was different then
okay then I would put more thought into

2928
01:42:19,750 --> 01:42:19,760

07:02:10,270 --> 07:02:10,280
injection that I heard of before from
 

11959
07:02:10,280 --> 07:02:11,948

friends that they got from their doctor

11960
07:02:11,948 --> 07:02:11,958
friends that they got from their doctor
 

11961
07:02:11,958 --> 07:02:14,468
friends that they got from their doctor
and then the pain was away well like

11962
07:02:14,468 --> 07:02:14,478
and then the pain was away well like
 

11963
07:02:14,478 --> 07:02:17,830
and then the pain was away well like
temporarily for a good amount of time

11964
07:02:17,830 --> 07:02:17,840
temporarily for a good amount of time
 

11965
07:02:17,840 --> 07:02:20,788
temporarily for a good amount of time
and then let's say they do that and then

11966
07:02:20,788 --> 07:02:20,798
and then let's say they do that and then
 

11967
07:02:20,798 --> 07:02:23,030
and then let's say they do that and then
I let's say I actually don't feel the

12962
07:27:53,910 --> 07:27:53,920

 

12963
07:27:53,920 --> 07:27:57,468

maybe I think I currently only have one

12964
07:27:57,468 --> 07:27:57,478
maybe I think I currently only have one
 

12965
07:27:57,478 --> 07:27:59,788
maybe I think I currently only have one
but it's not

12966
07:27:59,788 --> 07:27:59,798
but it's not
 

12967
07:27:59,798 --> 07:28:03,548
but it's not
in those regions that you

12968
07:28:03,548 --> 07:28:03,558
in those regions that you
 

12969
07:28:03,558 --> 07:28:07,430
in those regions that you
mentioned sorry it's not in my power I

12970
07:28:07,430 --> 07:28:07,440
mentioned sorry it's not in my power I
 

12971
07:28:07,440 --> 07:28:10,948
mentioned sorry it's not in my power I
don't choose where to go um I even

12972
07:28:10,948 --> 07:28:10,958
don't choose where to go um I even
 

12973
07:28:10,958 --> 07:28:13,788
don't choose where to go um I even
begged to be for example in a Korean

12974
07:28:13,788 --> 07:28:13,798
begged to be for example in a Korean
 

12975
07:28:13,798 --> 07:28:15,948
begged to be for example in a Korean
convention and it still didn't work out

12976
07:28:15,948 --> 07:28:15,958
convention and it still didn't work out
 

12977
07:28:15,958 --> 07:28:17,990
convention and it still didn't work out
so I don't really have much power of it

12978
07:28:17,990 --> 07:28:18,000
so I don't really have much power of it
 

12979
07:28:18,000 --> 07:28:20,868
so I don't really have much power of it
you got got you guys got to um ask for

advance um I think the na cons they know

12986
07:28:34,628 --> 07:28:34,638
advance um I think the na cons they know
 

12987
07:28:34,638 --> 07:28:38,910
advance um I think the na cons they know
that people want whole alive and uh all

12988
07:28:38,910 --> 07:28:38,920
that people want whole alive and uh all
 

12989
07:28:38,920 --> 07:28:40,708
that people want whole alive and uh all
that but like currently I feel like

12990
07:28:40,708 --> 07:28:40,718
that but like currently I feel like
 

12991
07:28:40,718 --> 07:28:42,350
that but like currently I feel like
they're asking more for people they

12992
07:28:42,350 --> 07:28:42,360
they're asking more for people they
 

12993
07:28:42,360 --> 07:28:44,948
they're asking more for people they
didn't have before and like Advent gets

12994
07:28:44,948 --> 07:28:44,958
didn't have before and like Advent gets
 

12995
07:28:44,958 --> 07:28:47,590
didn't have before and like Advent gets
a lot of action I think which is fine

12996
07:28:47,590 --> 07:28:47,600
a lot of action I think which is fine
 

12997
07:28:47,600 --> 07:28:51,388
a lot of action I think which is fine
you know they they are jumping into the

12998
07:28:51,388 --> 07:28:51,398
you know they they are jumping into the
 

12999
07:28:51,398 --> 07:28:53,910
you know they they are jumping into the
market and I'm sure a lot of people want

13000
07:28:53,910 --> 07:28:53,920
market and I'm sure a lot of people want
 

13001
07:28:53,920 --> 07:28:56,388
market and I'm sure a lot of people want
to see them but especially for

13002
07:28:56,388 --> 07:28:56,398
to see them but especially for
 

13003
07:28:56,398 --> 07:28:59,670
to see them but especially for
conventions where maybe was in previous

13004
07:28:59,670 --> 07:28:59,680
conventions where maybe was in previous
 

13005
07:28:59,680 --> 07:29:02,230
conventions where maybe was in previous
years yeah I I think it makes total

13006
07:29:02,230 --> 07:29:02,240
years yeah I I think it makes total
 

13007
07:29:02,240 --> 07:29:04,070
years yeah I I think it makes total
sense that they wouldn't invite me again

13008
07:29:04,070 --> 07:29:04,080
sense that they wouldn't invite me again
 

13009
07:29:04,080 --> 07:29:06,628
sense that they wouldn't invite me again
over inviting someone from Advent for

13010
07:29:06,628 --> 07:29:06,638
over inviting someone from Advent for
 

13011
07:29:06,638 --> 07:29:08,308
over inviting someone from Advent for
example for the first time that's just

13012
07:29:08,308 --> 07:29:08,318
example for the first time that's just
 

13013
07:29:08,318 --> 07:29:11,990
example for the first time that's just
fair so yeah I feel like this year is

13014
07:29:11,990 --> 07:29:12,000
fair so yeah I feel like this year is
 

13015
07:29:12,000 --> 07:29:17,708
fair so yeah I feel like this year is
going to be the year of Advent

13016
07:29:17,708 --> 07:29:17,718

 

13017
07:29:17,718 --> 07:29:20,468

probably I know you want to see see me

13018
07:29:20,468 --> 07:29:20,478
probably I know you want to see see me
 

13019
07:29:20,478 --> 07:29:24,190
probably I know you want to see see me
yeah it's tough it's tough so what you

13020
07:29:24,190 --> 07:29:24,200
yeah it's tough it's tough so what you
 

13021
07:29:24,200 --> 07:29:27,628
yeah it's tough it's tough so what you
could do is just uh ask maybe some

13022
07:29:27,628 --> 07:29:27,638
could do is just uh ask maybe some
 

13023
07:29:27,638 --> 07:29:30,468
could do is just uh ask maybe some
bigger conventions who haven't had the

13024
07:29:30,468 --> 07:29:30,478
bigger conventions who haven't had the
 

13025
07:29:30,478 --> 07:29:33,030
bigger conventions who haven't had the
pleasure of having whole life guests yet

13026
07:29:33,030 --> 07:29:33,040
pleasure of having whole life guests yet
 

13027
07:29:33,040 --> 07:29:35,468
pleasure of having whole life guests yet
maybe maybe there's still some there's

13028
07:29:35,468 --> 07:29:35,478
maybe maybe there's still some there's
 

13029
07:29:35,478 --> 07:29:37,070
maybe maybe there's still some there's
certainly some big ones out there still

13030
07:29:37,070 --> 07:29:37,080
certainly some big ones out there still
 

13031
07:29:37,080 --> 07:29:40,670
certainly some big ones out there still
that didn't do that yet right so I think

13032
07:29:40,670 --> 07:29:40,680
that didn't do that yet right so I think
 

13033
07:29:40,680 --> 07:29:48,430
that didn't do that yet right so I think
that's what I can recommend

13034
07:29:48,430 --> 07:29:48,440

 

13035
07:29:48,440 --> 07:29:50,910
