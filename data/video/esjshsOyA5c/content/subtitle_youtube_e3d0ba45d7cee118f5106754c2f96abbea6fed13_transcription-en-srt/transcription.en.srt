I would not change my form of gameplay

7207
03:08:26,330 --> 03:08:26,340
I would not change my form of gameplay
 

7208
03:08:26,340 --> 03:08:29,330
I would not change my form of gameplay
for anything oh what's this at least I

7209
03:08:29,330 --> 03:08:29,340
for anything oh what's this at least I
 

7210
03:08:29,340 --> 03:08:31,610
for anything oh what's this at least I
figured it out eventually yeah so we can

7211

figured it out eventually yeah so we can
 

7212
03:08:31,620 --> 03:08:32,929
figured it out eventually yeah so we can
like throw something on it that's

7213
