started
 

1225
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,630
started
and actually like um i'm not sure if we

1226
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:18,640
and actually like um i'm not sure if we
 

1227
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,029
and actually like um i'm not sure if we
should

1228
00:25:19,029 --> 00:25:19,039
should
 

1229
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,590
should
build like a really serious base here

1230
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:21,600
build like a really serious base here
 

1231
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,549
build like a really serious base here
already

1232
00:25:22,549 --> 00:25:22,559
already
 

1233
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,549
already
sure why not there's maybe there's a

1234
00:25:24,549 --> 00:25:24,559
sure why not there's maybe there's a
 

1235
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:25,830
sure why not there's maybe there's a
better space for

1236
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:25,840
better space for
 

1237
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,710
better space for
for our base maybe we can maybe we can

1238
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:28,720
for our base maybe we can maybe we can
 

1239
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,029
for our base maybe we can maybe we can
look

1240
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:29,039
look
 

1241
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,789
look
we can spend our time looking for the

1242
00:25:30,789 --> 00:25:30,799
we can spend our time looking for the
 

1243
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,070
we can spend our time looking for the
perfect place

1244
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:32,080
perfect place
 

1245
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,230

yeah because eventually probably we want
to have it like really big right so

1248
00:25:37,029 --> 00:25:37,039
to have it like really big right so
 

1249
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,750
to have it like really big right so
this area i think is not so suitable to

1250
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:39,760
this area i think is not so suitable to
 

1251
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,950
this area i think is not so suitable to
make such a big

1252
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:40,960
make such a big
 

1253
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,350
make such a big
big big big like um village

01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:23,270
see you again sometime
a song in my heart a world of worry

4284
01:28:23,270 --> 01:28:23,280
a song in my heart a world of worry
 

4285
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:25,110
a song in my heart a world of worry
falling on your mind wait don't we leave

4286
01:28:25,110 --> 01:28:25,120
falling on your mind wait don't we leave
 

4287
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:30,710
falling on your mind wait don't we leave
it all behind

4288
01:28:30,710 --> 01:28:30,720

 

4289
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:40,870

[Music]

4290
01:28:40,870 --> 01:28:40,880

 

4291
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:43,290

a heart

4292
01:28:43,290 --> 01:28:43,300
a heart
 

4293
01:28:43,300 --> 01:29:08,830
a heart

01:29:08,830 --> 01:29:08,840

 

4295
