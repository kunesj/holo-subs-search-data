1656
00:59:35,950 --> 00:59:35,960
you could totally do it in a vertical
 

1657
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:38,430
you could totally do it in a vertical
stream because there's no reason for it

1658
00:59:38,430 --> 00:59:38,440
stream because there's no reason for it
 

1659
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:46,670

for
sure I got to learn all of waya

2242
01:21:33,990 --> 01:21:34,000

 

2243
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:37,310

that's

2246
01:21:38,669 --> 01:21:38,679
that's
 

2247
01:21:38,679 --> 01:21:41,990
that's
right oh I'm uses Leap Motion in her 3D

2248
01:21:41,990 --> 01:21:42,000
right oh I'm uses Leap Motion in her 3D
 

2249
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,310
right oh I'm uses Leap Motion in her 3D
soon you can ask her how she does it

2250
01:21:43,310 --> 01:21:43,320
soon you can ask her how she does it
 

2251
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:44,830
soon you can ask her how she does it
with the

2252
01:21:44,830 --> 01:21:44,840
with the
 

2253
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:49,510
with the
regular oh I wouldn't uh automatically

2254
01:21:49,510 --> 01:21:49,520
regular oh I wouldn't uh automatically
 

2255
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:52,110
regular oh I wouldn't uh automatically
agree that she assume that she uses the

2256
01:21:52,110 --> 01:21:52,120
agree that she assume that she uses the
 

2257
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:54,070
agree that she assume that she uses the
regular app for that either I didn't see

2258
01:21:54,070 --> 01:21:54,080
regular app for that either I didn't see
 

2259
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:56,430
regular app for that either I didn't see
a an option for Leap Motion but maybe

2260
01:21:56,430 --> 01:21:56,440
a an option for Leap Motion but maybe
 

2261
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:58,390
a an option for Leap Motion but maybe
there is but also the thing is so okay

2262
01:21:58,390 --> 01:21:58,400
there is but also the thing is so okay
 

2263
01:21:58,400 --> 01:21:59,950
there is but also the thing is so okay
the thing

2264
01:21:59,950 --> 01:21:59,960
the thing
 

2265
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:02,830
the thing
is this when I'm when I why my face

2266
01:22:02,830 --> 01:22:02,840
is this when I'm when I why my face
 

2267
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:05,030
is this when I'm when I why my face
looks like so much more expressive right

2268
01:22:05,030 --> 01:22:05,040
looks like so much more expressive right
 

2269
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:09,149
looks like so much more expressive right
now is called 51 blend shapes okay I

2270
01:22:09,149 --> 01:22:09,159
now is called 51 blend shapes okay I
 

2271
01:22:09,159 --> 01:22:10,790
now is called 51 blend shapes okay I
don't know much about this stuff either

2272
01:22:10,790 --> 01:22:10,800
don't know much about this stuff either
 

2273
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:12,510
don't know much about this stuff either
okay I was I learned this stuff from

2274
01:22:12,510 --> 01:22:12,520
okay I was I learned this stuff from
 

2275
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:15,990
okay I was I learned this stuff from
like Amy and and husk and so on um but

2276
01:22:15,990 --> 01:22:16,000
like Amy and and husk and so on um but
 

2277
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,750
like Amy and and husk and so on um but
it's called 51 blend shapes I guess

2278
01:22:18,750 --> 01:22:18,760
it's called 51 blend shapes I guess
 

2279
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:21,590
it's called 51 blend shapes I guess
because there like yeah my my face is

2280
01:22:21,590 --> 01:22:21,600
because there like yeah my my face is
 

2281
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:25,030
because there like yeah my my face is
just 51 times better now

2282
01:22:25,030 --> 01:22:25,040
just 51 times better now
 

2283
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:29,709
just 51 times better now
um and um I can't use this in the whole

2284
01:22:29,709 --> 01:22:29,719
um and um I can't use this in the whole
 

2285
01:22:29,719 --> 01:22:33,110
um and um I can't use this in the whole
life app

2286
01:22:33,110 --> 01:22:33,120

 

2287
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:35,950

unless unless I use like a 1 million

2288
01:22:35,950 --> 01:22:35,960
unless unless I use like a 1 million
 

2289
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:39,790
unless unless I use like a 1 million
wish for

2290
01:22:39,790 --> 01:22:39,800

 

2291
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:43,270

it so I have to use an external app for

2292
01:22:43,270 --> 01:22:43,280
it so I have to use an external app for
 

2293
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:49,310
it so I have to use an external app for
it which is allowed and all that

2294
01:22:49,310 --> 01:22:49,320

 

2295
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:55,270

yeah yeah um

2296
01:22:55,270 --> 01:22:55,280

 

2297
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:58,430

which uh also means that like for

2298
01:22:58,430 --> 01:22:58,440
which uh also means that like for
 

2299
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:00,750
which uh also means that like for
example when I do full body

2300
01:23:00,750 --> 01:23:00,760
example when I do full body
 

2301
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:03,590
example when I do full body
3D I can probably figure out how to use

2302
01:23:03,590 --> 01:23:03,600
3D I can probably figure out how to use
 

2303
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:07,270
3D I can probably figure out how to use
my full body 3D in external apps as well

2304
01:23:07,270 --> 01:23:07,280
my full body 3D in external apps as well
 

2305
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:10,229
my full body 3D in external apps as well
um but up until now I was using the

2306
01:23:10,229 --> 01:23:10,239
um but up until now I was using the
 

2307
01:23:10,239 --> 01:23:13,229
um but up until now I was using the
whole live app for that and then I

2308
01:23:13,229 --> 01:23:13,239
whole live app for that and then I
 

2309
01:23:13,239 --> 01:23:16,310
whole live app for that and then I
wouldn't be able to combine the fresh

2310
01:23:16,310 --> 01:23:16,320
wouldn't be able to combine the fresh
 

2311
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:20,950
wouldn't be able to combine the fresh
looking fancy 51 Bland shapes with the

2312
01:23:20,950 --> 01:23:20,960
looking fancy 51 Bland shapes with the
 

2313
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:23,430
looking fancy 51 Bland shapes with the
full body tracking that I can't do

2314
01:23:23,430 --> 01:23:23,440
full body tracking that I can't do
 

2315
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:25,390
full body tracking that I can't do
because I don't have the 51 blend Jabs

2316
01:23:25,390 --> 01:23:25,400
because I don't have the 51 blend Jabs
 

2317
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:29,470
because I don't have the 51 blend Jabs
in my in the app in the Holo app 2

before uh I I I think I'm a allowed to
do like more high quality models too but

2340
01:23:56,950 --> 01:23:56,960
do like more high quality models too but
 

2341
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:59,590
do like more high quality models too but
it's like really expensive so I don't
