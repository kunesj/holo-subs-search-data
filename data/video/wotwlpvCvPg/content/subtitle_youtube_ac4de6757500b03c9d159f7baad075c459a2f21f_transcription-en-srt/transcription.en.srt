okay so you can you can match those

232
00:07:51,749 --> 00:07:51,759
okay so you can you can match those
 

233
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:52,950
okay so you can you can match those
together

234
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:52,960
together
 

235
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,350
together
there's also like direction tiles that

236
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:55,360
there's also like direction tiles that
 

237
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,029
there's also like direction tiles that
you can do

238
00:07:57,029 --> 00:07:57,039
you can do
 

239
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,950
you can do
yeah basically it's like uh try to match

240
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:00,960
yeah basically it's like uh try to match
 

241
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,150
yeah basically it's like uh try to match
uh the same looking tiles the easiest

242
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:04,160
uh the same looking tiles the easiest
 

243
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,110
uh the same looking tiles the easiest
i think okay like a matching game okay

uh no no they have like different sets

292
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,040
uh no no they have like different sets
 

293
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,310
uh no no they have like different sets
of tiles so you know how

294
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:16,320
of tiles so you know how
 

295
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,310
of tiles so you know how
um one set of tiles is like red on the

296
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:18,320
um one set of tiles is like red on the
 

297
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,670
um one set of tiles is like red on the
bottom and there's like green on the

yeah so they're like different uh type
 

303
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,030
yeah so they're like different uh type
of sets and you have to do like the

304
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:25,040
of sets and you have to do like the
 

305
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,790
of sets and you have to do like the
number like the sequence or the

306
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:26,800
number like the sequence or the
 

307
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,870
number like the sequence or the
triple same number yeah

308
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:30,880
triple same number yeah
 

309
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,110
triple same number yeah
can you go like seven six five

310
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:35,120
can you go like seven six five
 

311
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,470
can you go like seven six five
yes because that's the same as

yeah but one one thing to run out of
 

319
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,750
yeah but one one thing to run out of
numbers to

320
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:49,760
numbers to
 

321
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,790
numbers to
do i just start a new chain yeah you can

322
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:52,800
do i just start a new chain yeah you can
 

323
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,389
do i just start a new chain yeah you can
start a new chain so you want to have

324
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:54,399
start a new chain so you want to have
 

325
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,030
start a new chain so you want to have
like

326
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:55,040
like
 

327
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,190
like
uh uh i think four

sets of three or like uh a number
 

333
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,150
sets of three or like uh a number
sequence

334
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:06,160
sequence
 

335
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,389
sequence
like three sets of those and then like a

336
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:08,399
like three sets of those and then like a

1623
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:30,150
uh you need to have the yaku and one of
the simplest one

1624
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:30,160
the simplest one
 

1625
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,349
the simplest one
you can get is called a all symbols

1626
00:44:33,349 --> 00:44:33,359
you can get is called a all symbols

if you have a lot of east tiles
east tiles like and then uh you can try

1646
00:45:05,109 --> 00:45:05,119
east tiles like and then uh you can try
 

1647
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:09,430
east tiles like and then uh you can try
to get three of those

1648
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:09,440

 

1649
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,589

so you just uh threw down some some
 

1749
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,270
so you just uh threw down some some
um some stones that

1750

now the only reason that i put it down

2266
01:05:47,589 --> 01:05:47,599
now the only reason that i put it down
 

2267
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:49,349
now the only reason that i put it down
is because i had two selves and then

2268
01:05:49,349 --> 01:05:49,359
is because i had two selves and then
 

2269
01:05:49,359 --> 01:05:50,789
is because i had two selves and then
someone put down the self

2270
01:05:50,789 --> 01:05:50,799
someone put down the self
 

2271
01:05:50,799 --> 01:05:54,390
someone put down the self
so i stole it that's why you have three

2272
01:05:54,390 --> 01:05:54,400
so i stole it that's why you have three
 

2273
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:55,190
so i stole it that's why you have three
on your own

2274
01:05:55,190 --> 01:05:55,200
on your own
 

2275
01:05:55,200 --> 01:06:02,829
