3284
01:41:29,689 --> 01:41:29,699
it's hard to tell which is a nice car
 

3285
01:41:29,699 --> 01:41:33,649
it's hard to tell which is a nice car
but I don't see any police cars

3290
01:41:45,530 --> 01:41:45,540

 

3291
01:41:45,540 --> 01:41:48,070

so I'm sure they don't mind

3292
01:41:48,070 --> 01:41:48,080
so I'm sure they don't mind
 

3293
01:41:48,080 --> 01:41:52,990
so I'm sure they don't mind
and I'm basically doing less damage

3303
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:07,189
no but I think generally I don't think I
would do that before getting a car

3304
01:42:07,189 --> 01:42:07,199
would do that before getting a car
 

3305

so I I I I saw okay five makes the floor
 

3935
02:01:11,820 --> 02:01:13,790

the warmest okay
 

3937
02:01:13,800 --> 02:01:16,609
the warmest okay
so I set it on five sometimes in the

3938
02:01:16,609 --> 02:01:16,619
so I set it on five sometimes in the
 

3939
02:01:16,619 --> 02:01:18,589
so I set it on five sometimes in the
winter sometimes less than five but yeah

3940
02:01:18,589 --> 02:01:18,599
winter sometimes less than five but yeah
 

3941
02:01:18,599 --> 02:01:21,589
winter sometimes less than five but yeah
I I I know that the floor because it was

3942
02:01:21,589 --> 02:01:21,599
I I I know that the floor because it was
 

3943
02:01:21,599 --> 02:01:22,669
I I I know that the floor because it was
floor heating

3944
02:01:22,669 --> 02:01:22,679
floor heating
 

3945
02:01:22,679 --> 02:01:26,750
floor heating
was warmer at five than it was at three

3946
02:01:26,750 --> 02:01:26,760
was warmer at five than it was at three
 

3947
02:01:26,760 --> 02:01:28,870
was warmer at five than it was at three
you know

3948
02:01:28,870 --> 02:01:28,880
you know
 

3949
02:01:28,880 --> 02:01:33,589
you know
so in the summer time I tried to you

3950
02:01:33,589 --> 02:01:33,599
so in the summer time I tried to you
 

3951
02:01:33,599 --> 02:01:41,089
so in the summer time I tried to you
switch between Heating and Cooling

3952
02:01:41,089 --> 02:01:41,099

 

3953
02:01:41,099 --> 02:01:43,370

so I just always had it on five

3954
02:01:43,370 --> 02:01:43,380
so I just always had it on five
 

3955
02:01:43,380 --> 02:01:45,350
so I just always had it on five
but then the other day I experimented

3956
02:01:45,350 --> 02:01:45,360
but then the other day I experimented
 

3957
02:01:45,360 --> 02:01:47,089
but then the other day I experimented
and I set it to one and I noticed the

3958
02:01:47,089 --> 02:01:47,099
and I set it to one and I noticed the
 

3959
02:01:47,099 --> 02:01:50,870
and I set it to one and I noticed the
floor got ice cold

3960
02:01:50,870 --> 02:01:50,880

 

3961
02:01:50,880 --> 02:01:53,209

I'll catch you around then B call me if

3962
02:01:53,209 --> 02:01:53,219
I'll catch you around then B call me if
 

3963

isn't that interesting

3966
02:01:57,229 --> 02:01:57,239
isn't that interesting
 

3967
02:01:57,239 --> 02:01:59,689
isn't that interesting
why is it the opposite for cooling and

3968
02:01:59,689 --> 02:01:59,699
why is it the opposite for cooling and
 

3969
02:01:59,699 --> 02:02:01,790
why is it the opposite for cooling and
come on nobody nobody

3970

really like
oh that is completely my fault of course

3974
02:02:05,450 --> 02:02:05,460
oh that is completely my fault of course
 

3975
02:02:05,460 --> 02:02:08,330
oh that is completely my fault of course
I would assume that if A5 is the most

3976
02:02:08,330 --> 02:02:08,340
I would assume that if A5 is the most
 

3977
02:02:08,340 --> 02:02:10,189
I would assume that if A5 is the most
for heating then five would also be the

3978
02:02:10,189 --> 02:02:10,199
for heating then five would also be the
 

3979
02:02:10,199 --> 02:02:13,669
for heating then five would also be the
most for cooling don't you think

3980
02:02:13,669 --> 02:02:13,679
most for cooling don't you think
 

3981
02:02:13,679 --> 02:02:15,050
most for cooling don't you think
right and then the other thing that

3982
02:02:15,050 --> 02:02:15,060
right and then the other thing that
 

3983
02:02:15,060 --> 02:02:17,629
right and then the other thing that
confuses me is because they told me that

3984
02:02:17,629 --> 02:02:17,639
confuses me is because they told me that
 

3985
02:02:17,639 --> 02:02:19,970
confuses me is because they told me that
um the heating comes from the floor but

3986
02:02:19,970 --> 02:02:19,980
um the heating comes from the floor but
 

3987
02:02:19,980 --> 02:02:22,609
um the heating comes from the floor but
the cooling comes from the ceiling

3988
02:02:22,609 --> 02:02:22,619
the cooling comes from the ceiling
 

3989
02:02:22,619 --> 02:02:25,790
the cooling comes from the ceiling
but that was wrong because

3990
02:02:25,790 --> 02:02:25,800
but that was wrong because
 

3991
02:02:25,800 --> 02:02:27,890
but that was wrong because
now that I finally figured out how it

3992
02:02:27,890 --> 02:02:27,900
now that I finally figured out how it
 

3993
02:02:27,900 --> 02:02:29,270
now that I finally figured out how it
works

3994
02:02:29,270 --> 02:02:29,280
works
 

3995
02:02:29,280 --> 02:02:32,330
works
the floor gets ice cold

3996
02:02:32,330 --> 02:02:32,340
the floor gets ice cold
 

3997
02:02:32,340 --> 02:02:34,729
the floor gets ice cold
so

3998
02:02:34,729 --> 02:02:34,739
so
 

3999
02:02:34,739 --> 02:02:36,470
so
it doesn't come from the ceiling it

4000
02:02:36,470 --> 02:02:36,480
it doesn't come from the ceiling it
 

4001
02:02:36,480 --> 02:02:38,870
it doesn't come from the ceiling it
comes from the floor

4002
02:02:38,870 --> 02:02:38,880
comes from the floor
 

4003
02:02:38,880 --> 02:02:42,229
comes from the floor
weird stuff so yeah recently it's been

4004
02:02:42,229 --> 02:02:42,239
weird stuff so yeah recently it's been
 

4005
02:02:42,239 --> 02:02:47,089
weird stuff so yeah recently it's been

4008
02:02:49,430 --> 02:02:49,440
like proper air conditioning but it's
 

4009
02:02:49,440 --> 02:02:53,270
