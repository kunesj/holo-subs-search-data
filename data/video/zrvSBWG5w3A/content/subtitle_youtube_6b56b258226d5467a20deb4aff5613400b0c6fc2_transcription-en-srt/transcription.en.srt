04:35:49,480 --> 04:35:51,109
then there were no time slots known yet
but when they were planning to do it and

10640
04:35:51,109 --> 04:35:51,119
but when they were planning to do it and
 

10641
04:35:51,119 --> 04:35:54,070
but when they were planning to do it and
once once they said that it would be at

wouldn't mind but if it's more like a
 

11491
04:56:36,878 --> 04:56:39,470
wouldn't mind but if it's more like a
long time frame it will be difficult

11492
04:56:39,470 --> 04:56:39,480
long time frame it will be difficult
 

11493
04:56:39,480 --> 04:56:40,910
long time frame it will be difficult
like people will want to play other

11494
04:56:40,910 --> 04:56:40,920
like people will want to play other
 

11495
04:56:40,920 --> 04:56:43,310
like people will want to play other

11496
04:56:43,310 --> 04:56:43,320
things too and then it's like okay on
 

11497
04:56:43,320 --> 04:56:46,990
things too and then it's like okay on
which days you know but I wouldn't mind

11498
04:56:46,990 --> 04:56:47,000
which days you know but I wouldn't mind

it coming back for season two maybe we

11500
04:56:49,110 --> 04:56:49,120
it coming back for season two maybe we
 

11501
04:56:49,120 --> 04:56:51,708
it coming back for season two maybe we
can keep the server and our

11502
04:56:51,708 --> 04:56:51,718
can keep the server and our
 

11503
04:56:51,718 --> 04:56:54,510
can keep the server and our
characters like I don't know I guess you

11504
04:56:54,510 --> 04:56:54,520
characters like I don't know I guess you
 

11505
04:56:54,520 --> 04:56:56,230
characters like I don't know I guess you
can't keep the server running forever if

11506
04:56:56,230 --> 04:56:56,240
can't keep the server running forever if
 

11507
04:56:56,240 --> 04:56:58,510
can't keep the server running forever if
it's not in use and we have do we have

11508
04:56:58,510 --> 04:56:58,520
it's not in use and we have do we have
 

11509
04:56:58,520 --> 04:57:01,190
it's not in use and we have do we have
to pay for it I mean I don't know but

11510
04:57:01,190 --> 04:57:01,200
to pay for it I mean I don't know but
 

11511
04:57:01,200 --> 04:57:04,190
to pay for it I mean I don't know but
maybe like a month later after first

11512
04:57:04,190 --> 04:57:04,200
maybe like a month later after first
 

11513
04:57:04,200 --> 04:57:07,150
maybe like a month later after first
season and so to say maybe we could do

11514
04:57:07,150 --> 04:57:07,160
season and so to say maybe we could do
 

11515
04:57:07,160 --> 04:57:09,030
season and so to say maybe we could do
another one like so far I think

11516
04:57:09,030 --> 04:57:09,040
another one like so far I think
 

11517
04:57:09,040 --> 04:57:11,190
another one like so far I think
everybody's having a fun time and would

11518
04:57:11,190 --> 04:57:11,200
everybody's having a fun time and would
 

11519
04:57:11,200 --> 04:57:12,750
everybody's having a fun time and would
love to do another one too I would love

11520
04:57:12,750 --> 04:57:12,760
love to do another one too I would love
 

11521
04:57:12,760 --> 04:57:15,628
love to do another one too I would love
to do another

11522
04:57:15,628 --> 04:57:15,638

 

11523
04:57:15,638 --> 04:57:18,670

one like if it remains if the server

11524
04:57:18,670 --> 04:57:18,680
one like if it remains if the server
 

11525
04:57:18,680 --> 04:57:21,430
one like if it remains if the server
doesn't get like completely closed down

11526
04:57:21,430 --> 04:57:21,440
doesn't get like completely closed down
 

11527
04:57:21,440 --> 04:57:24,548
doesn't get like completely closed down
then it will probably

11528
04:57:24,548 --> 04:57:24,558
then it will probably
 

11529
04:57:24,558 --> 04:57:27,110
then it will probably
remain yeah I I think like one week get

11530
04:57:27,110 --> 04:57:27,120
remain yeah I I think like one week get
 

11531
04:57:27,120 --> 04:57:29,310
remain yeah I I think like one week get
a time is fine like having it go for a

11532
04:57:29,310 --> 04:57:29,320
a time is fine like having it go for a
 

11533
04:57:29,320 --> 04:57:31,750
a time is fine like having it go for a
full month it will be difficult to get

11534
04:57:31,750 --> 04:57:31,760
full month it will be difficult to get
 

11535
04:57:31,760 --> 04:57:35,750
full month it will be difficult to get
