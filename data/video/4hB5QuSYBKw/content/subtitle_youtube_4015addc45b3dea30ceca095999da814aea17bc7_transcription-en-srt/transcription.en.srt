once you have played through the

284
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:18,400
once you have played through the
 

285
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,270
once you have played through the
tutorial

286
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:19,280
tutorial
 

287
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,469
tutorial
another thing to note um is that um

288
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:24,479
another thing to note um is that um
 

289
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,830
another thing to note um is that um
guys uh i'm not a huge stickler for the

290
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:27,840
guys uh i'm not a huge stickler for the
 

291
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,830
guys uh i'm not a huge stickler for the
rules

292
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:28,840
rules
 

293
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,990
rules
um but basically

294
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:32,000
um but basically
 

295
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,029
um but basically
essentially i may change some things

296
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:35,039
essentially i may change some things
 

297
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,510
essentially i may change some things
from the traditional world of darkness

298
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:37,520
from the traditional world of darkness
 

299
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,110
from the traditional world of darkness
so that things are a little easier to

300
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:39,120
so that things are a little easier to
 

301
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,390
so that things are a little easier to
understand

302
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:40,400
understand
 

303
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,830
understand
um especially for like the combat system

304
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:43,840
um especially for like the combat system
 

305
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,510
um especially for like the combat system
um i don't do anything too

306
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:45,520
um i don't do anything too
 

307
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,270
um i don't do anything too
in depth and integrated i like for it to

308
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:47,280
in depth and integrated i like for it to
 

309
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,350
in depth and integrated i like for it to
be a basic combat system with

310
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:49,360
be a basic combat system with
 

311
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,390
be a basic combat system with
a lot of role play um so yeah i think

312
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:52,400
a lot of role play um so yeah i think
 

313
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,869
a lot of role play um so yeah i think
uh the golden rule here is that there

314
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:54,879
uh the golden rule here is that there
 

315
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,909
uh the golden rule here is that there
are no rules

316
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:55,919
are no rules
 

317
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,390
are no rules
um but there there kind of are there's

318
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:58,400
um but there there kind of are there's
 

319
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,990
um but there there kind of are there's
enough there are enough rules to keep

320
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:00,000
enough there are enough rules to keep
 

321
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,790
enough there are enough rules to keep
the game

322
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:00,800
the game
 

323
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,710
the game
within a certain bound but not enough to

324
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:02,720
within a certain bound but not enough to
 

325
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,150
within a certain bound but not enough to
detract from the fun

326
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:04,160
detract from the fun
 

327
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,230
detract from the fun
um or make things so painstakingly

328
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:06,240
um or make things so painstakingly
 

329
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,710
um or make things so painstakingly
detailed that they stop being fun

330
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:08,720
detailed that they stop being fun
 

331
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,790
detailed that they stop being fun
that that's when it's the worst is when

332
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:10,800
that that's when it's the worst is when
 

333
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,990
that that's when it's the worst is when
is when we're like wait how does

334
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:12,000
is when we're like wait how does
 

335
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,830
is when we're like wait how does

00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:19,600
difficulty was not a thing
 

505
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,630
difficulty was not a thing
um eight nine and ten were successes and

506
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:22,640
um eight nine and ten were successes and
 

507
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,630
um eight nine and ten were successes and
that's all that there was to it

508
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:24,640
that's all that there was to it
 

509
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,829
that's all that there was to it
um however the more research that i did

510
00:11:27,829 --> 00:11:27,839
um however the more research that i did
 

511
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,430
um however the more research that i did
the more that i realized hey

512
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:29,440
the more that i realized hey
 

513
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,990
the more that i realized hey
some people set difficulty for things so

514
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:32,000
some people set difficulty for things so
 

515
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,430
some people set difficulty for things so
for example kiara

516
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:33,440
for example kiara
 

517
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,069
for example kiara
give me an example of a really easy task

518
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:36,079
give me an example of a really easy task
 

519
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,630
give me an example of a really easy task
that anyone can do

520
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:38,640
that anyone can do
 

521
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,670
that anyone can do
walking up the stair walking up the

522
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:41,680
walking up the stair walking up the
 

523
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,150
walking up the stair walking up the
stairs

524
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:42,160
stairs
 

525
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,990
stairs
all right that should be decently easy

526
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:44,000
all right that should be decently easy
 

527
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,269
all right that should be decently easy
but some people will probably have

528
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:45,279
but some people will probably have
 

529
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,230
but some people will probably have
trouble with it

530
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:46,240
trouble with it
 

531
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,350
trouble with it
um maybe all right so okay so let's go

532
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:49,360
um maybe all right so okay so let's go
 

533
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,030
um maybe all right so okay so let's go
ahead and say

534
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:51,040
ahead and say
 

535
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,470
ahead and say
now i can do another one okay uh

536
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:54,480
now i can do another one okay uh
 

537
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,190
now i can do another one okay uh
picking up a stone picking up a stone

538
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:57,200
picking up a stone picking up a stone
 

539
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,670
picking up a stone picking up a stone
all right

540
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:57,680
all right
 

541
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,230
all right
sounds good um i think that should be

542
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:00,240
sounds good um i think that should be
 

543
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,269
sounds good um i think that should be
fairly doable

544
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:01,279
fairly doable
 

545
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,190
fairly doable
so we'll go ahead and set the difficulty

546
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:03,200
so we'll go ahead and set the difficulty
 

547
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,310
so we'll go ahead and set the difficulty
at four

548
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:04,320
at four
 

549
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,190
at four

but you also got a ten because you got
 

571
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,190
but you also got a ten because you got
because you got a 10 that's actually a

572
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:39,200
because you got a 10 that's actually a
 

573
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,870
because you got a 10 that's actually a
re-roll and also

re-roll and also
we set the difficulty at four correct

576
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:44,079
we set the difficulty at four correct
 

577
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,110

success
in order to moderately succeed like you

592
00:12:59,670 --> 00:12:59,680
in order to moderately succeed like you
 

593
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,750
in order to moderately succeed like you
can kind of do it it's not perfect but

594
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:01,760
can kind of do it it's not perfect but
 

595

you at least kind of did it all right
and then we're going to read

598
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:04,880
and then we're going to read
 

599
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,389
and then we're going to read
so i can reroll okay exactly so here we

600
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:08,399
so i can reroll okay exactly so here we
 

601
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,870
so i can reroll okay exactly so here we
go but you only got it two

602

go but you only got it two
 

603
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,230
go but you only got it two
so in total you got two successes

so in total you got two successes
and one one failure this one right here

606
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:16,639
and one one failure this one right here
 

607
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:17,350
and one one failure this one right here
now

608
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:17,360
now
 

609
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,190
now
some gm some gm would say that this one

especially not in the beginning um the

616
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:26,880
especially not in the beginning um the
 

617
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,790
especially not in the beginning um the
only time that you will fail is when you

618
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:28,800
only time that you will fail is when you
 

619
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,230
only time that you will fail is when you
get no successes

get no successes
 

621
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,430
get no successes
and it will be um a pretty significant

622
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:33,440
and it will be um a pretty significant
 

623
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,190
and it will be um a pretty significant
failure if you get no successes and a

624
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:35,200
failure if you get no successes and a
 

625

but because you succeeded in the first
place with getting a four and a ten

00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:40,000
place with getting a four and a ten
 

631
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,910
place with getting a four and a ten
um i'm going to go ahead and say that

632
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:41,920

you do another perception check as um

3930
01:18:36,550 --> 01:18:36,560
you do another perception check as um
 

3931
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:37,910
you do another perception check as um
you're taking these photos and then you

3932

so let's go ahead and roll a perception

3938
01:18:44,790 --> 01:18:44,800
so let's go ahead and roll a perception
 

3939
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,470
so let's go ahead and roll a perception

8333
02:48:55,120 --> 02:48:59,030

okay now the cause of distraction

8334
02:48:59,030 --> 02:48:59,040
okay now the cause of distraction
 

8335
02:48:59,040 --> 02:48:59,510
okay now the cause of distraction
however

8336
02:48:59,510 --> 02:48:59,520
however
 

8337
02:48:59,520 --> 02:49:00,870
however
i'm going to have to need you to make

8338
02:49:00,870 --> 02:49:00,880
i'm going to have to need you to make
 

8339
02:49:00,880 --> 02:49:02,710
i'm going to have to need you to make
another role in this sense because

8340
02:49:02,710 --> 02:49:02,720
another role in this sense because
 

8341
02:49:02,720 --> 02:49:04,309
another role in this sense because
you're doing something very calculated

8342
02:49:04,309 --> 02:49:04,319
you're doing something very calculated
 

8343
02:49:04,319 --> 02:49:05,190
you're doing something very calculated
because the birds

8344
02:49:05,190 --> 02:49:05,200
because the birds
 

8345
02:49:05,200 --> 02:49:06,790
because the birds
they won't just listen to you if you

8346
02:49:06,790 --> 02:49:06,800
they won't just listen to you if you
 

8347
02:49:06,800 --> 02:49:08,150
they won't just listen to you if you
just shoot the cage open they'll

8348
02:49:08,150 --> 02:49:08,160
just shoot the cage open they'll
 

8349
02:49:08,160 --> 02:49:09,510
just shoot the cage open they'll
probably try and flee and not try to

8350
02:49:09,510 --> 02:49:09,520
probably try and flee and not try to
 

8351
02:49:09,520 --> 02:49:10,790
probably try and flee and not try to
cause much of a commotion

8352
02:49:10,790 --> 02:49:10,800
cause much of a commotion
 

8353
02:49:10,800 --> 02:49:12,550
cause much of a commotion
so in this sense you're going to need to

8354
02:49:12,550 --> 02:49:12,560
so in this sense you're going to need to
 

8355
02:49:12,560 --> 02:49:13,990
so in this sense you're going to need to
instruct the birds

8356
02:49:13,990 --> 02:49:14,000
instruct the birds
 

8357
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:17,030
instruct the birds
okay instructing all right try to

8358
02:49:17,030 --> 02:49:17,040
okay instructing all right try to
 

8359
02:49:17,040 --> 02:49:20,230
okay instructing all right try to
try to try to

8360
02:49:20,230 --> 02:49:20,240

 

8361
02:49:20,240 --> 02:49:24,309

oh yeah tell them to do [\h__\h] you got it

02:49:24,309 --> 02:49:24,319
oh yeah tell them to do [\h__\h] you got it
 

8363
02:49:24,319 --> 02:49:26,950
oh yeah tell them to do [\h__\h] you got it
you yell do [\h__\h] to the birds um and

8366
02:49:28,389 --> 02:49:28,399
this is gonna be difficult he ate
 

8367
02:49:28,399 --> 02:49:31,110
this is gonna be difficult he ate
because you don't know the birds

8368
02:49:31,110 --> 02:49:31,120
because you don't know the birds
 

8369
02:49:31,120 --> 02:49:32,870
because you don't know the birds

there were also several
uh different branching paths that i set

10298
03:29:45,349 --> 03:29:45,359
uh different branching paths that i set
 

10299
03:29:45,359 --> 03:29:46,389
uh different branching paths that i set
up as well

10300
03:29:46,389 --> 03:29:46,399
up as well
 

10301
03:29:46,399 --> 03:29:48,389

exactly they probably would have taken
 

10315
03:29:58,319 --> 03:29:59,670
exactly they probably would have taken
some different branching paths

10316
03:29:59,670 --> 03:29:59,680
some different branching paths
 

10317
03:29:59,680 --> 03:30:00,710
some different branching paths
so there were there were different

10318
03:30:00,710 --> 03:30:00,720
