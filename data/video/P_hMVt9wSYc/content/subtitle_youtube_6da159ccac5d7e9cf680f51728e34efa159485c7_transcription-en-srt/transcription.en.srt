could then isolate and separate the hand

328
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:38,440
could then isolate and separate the hand
 

329
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,829
could then isolate and separate the hand
motion only but I have to still put on

330
00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:41,839
motion only but I have to still put on
 

331
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,269
motion only but I have to still put on
the whole setup otherwise like on

332
00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:44,279
the whole setup otherwise like on
 

333
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:47,150
the whole setup otherwise like on
Accents in their program it won't let me

334
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:47,160
Accents in their program it won't let me
 

335
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,629
Accents in their program it won't let me
record anything unless I have all the

336
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:49,639
record anything unless I have all the
 

337
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:54,509
record anything unless I have all the
trackers on um yeah but so basically I

338
00:14:54,509 --> 00:14:54,519
trackers on um yeah but so basically I
 

339
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:56,710
trackers on um yeah but so basically I
could just record it there and then

340
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:56,720
could just record it there and then
 

341
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,509
could just record it there and then
isolate the hand motion with my existing

342
00:14:59,509 --> 00:14:59,519
isolate the hand motion with my existing
 

343
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,590
isolate the hand motion with my existing

that will uh just walk around up onto
 

1241
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:51,069
that will uh just walk around up onto
the walls and then you can bring

1242
00:38:51,069 --> 00:38:51,079
the walls and then you can bring
 

1243
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:53,910
the walls and then you can bring
yourself up easy and fast that way but

1244

it's better to explain with this if I
 

1255
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,990
it's better to explain with this if I
want to build stairs you know you would

1256
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:11,000
want to build stairs you know you would
 

1257
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,190
want to build stairs you know you would
normally like do it like

1258
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:14,200
normally like do it like

this
 

1261
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:21,790
this
right but so what you can also do is

1262
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:21,800
right but so what you can also do is
 

1263
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,790
right but so what you can also do is
push I think did I push too

1264
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:24,800
push I think did I push too
 

1265
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,030
push I think did I push too
much yeah build it like this p push uh

1266
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:28,040
much yeah build it like this p push uh
 

1267
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,030
much yeah build it like this p push uh
create an object whatever can be

1268
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:30,040
create an object whatever can be
 

1269
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:34,030

trampolines too to push it a little bit

1270
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:34,040
trampolines too to push it a little bit
 

1271
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,710
trampolines too to push it a little bit
then it will be on like the

to and then in terms of
 

2949
01:24:33,719 --> 01:24:36,550
to and then in terms of
height I'm not sure how high we can

2950

01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:50,590
get well let's try a combination of
tables and

2956
01:24:50,590 --> 01:24:50,600

 

2957
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:59,350

01:28:10,709 --> 01:28:10,719
because uh the tree kind of creates a
 

3055
01:28:10,719 --> 01:28:12,790

01:28:19,149 --> 01:28:19,159
like further away than before so we will
 

3061
01:28:19,159 --> 01:28:22,709
like further away than before so we will
maybe lose the same amount of hide

3062
01:28:22,709 --> 01:28:22,719
maybe lose the same amount of hide
 

3063

6023
02:53:05,600 --> 02:53:10,269

statue

6026
02:53:16,429 --> 02:53:16,439

 

6027
02:53:16,439 --> 02:53:22,110

huh another statue now we have three

6028
02:53:22,110 --> 02:53:22,120

 

6029
02:53:22,120 --> 02:53:24,309

statues
 

6031
02:53:24,319 --> 02:53:27,510
statues
huh okay somewhere then there's a hint

6032
02:53:27,510 --> 02:53:27,520
huh okay somewhere then there's a hint
 

6033
02:53:27,520 --> 02:53:29,110
huh okay somewhere then there's a hint
probably we'll learn one more to have

6034
02:53:29,110 --> 02:53:29,120
probably we'll learn one more to have
 

6035
02:53:29,120 --> 02:53:31,790
probably we'll learn one more to have
four statues in total and somewhere

6036
02:53:31,790 --> 02:53:31,800
four statues in total and somewhere
 

6037
02:53:31,800 --> 02:53:33,349
four statues in total and somewhere
there's a hint that tells us which ones

6038
02:53:33,349 --> 02:53:33,359
there's a hint that tells us which ones
 

6039
02:53:33,359 --> 02:53:36,910
there's a hint that tells us which ones
to use or we just brute force

6040
02:53:36,910 --> 02:53:36,920
to use or we just brute force
 

6041
02:53:36,920 --> 02:53:39,150
to use or we just brute force
it I would just put something on the

6042
02:53:39,150 --> 02:53:39,160
it I would just put something on the
 

6043
02:53:39,160 --> 02:53:41,510
it I would just put something on the
other track to block the pl yeah that's

6044
02:53:41,510 --> 02:53:41,520
other track to block the pl yeah that's
 

6045
02:53:41,520 --> 02:53:45,429
other track to block the pl yeah that's
also certainly a

6046
02:53:45,429 --> 02:53:45,439
also certainly a
 

6047
02:53:45,439 --> 02:53:51,269
also certainly a
way where there's a will there's a way

6048
02:53:51,269 --> 02:53:51,279

 

6049
02:53:51,279 --> 02:53:59,830

but I

6050
02:53:59,830 --> 02:53:59,840

 

6051
02:53:59,840 --> 02:54:02,990

like what we just go

6052
02:54:02,990 --> 02:54:03,000
like what we just go
 

6053
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:08,550
like what we just go
back I guess

6054
02:54:08,550 --> 02:54:08,560

 

6055
02:54:08,560 --> 02:54:11,389

so there's still a couple rooms here I

6056
02:54:11,389 --> 02:54:11,399
so there's still a couple rooms here I
 

6057
02:54:11,399 --> 02:54:13,030
so there's still a couple rooms here I
want to warp there maybe that's what we

6058
02:54:13,030 --> 02:54:13,040
want to warp there maybe that's what we
 

6059
02:54:13,040 --> 02:54:14,389
want to warp there maybe that's what we
should be doing

6060
02:54:14,389 --> 02:54:14,399
should be doing
 

6061
02:54:14,399 --> 02:54:17,229
should be doing
anyway cuz all the closed by rooms have

6062
02:54:17,229 --> 02:54:17,239
anyway cuz all the closed by rooms have
 

6063
02:54:17,239 --> 02:54:19,429
anyway cuz all the closed by rooms have
already explored

6064
02:54:19,429 --> 02:54:19,439
already explored
 

6065
02:54:19,439 --> 02:54:21,309
already explored
and we got a new key now yeah we're

6066
02:54:21,309 --> 02:54:21,319
and we got a new key now yeah we're
 

6067
02:54:21,319 --> 02:54:23,830
and we got a new key now yeah we're
probably supposed to go here

6068
02:54:23,830 --> 02:54:23,840
probably supposed to go here
 

6069
02:54:23,840 --> 02:54:27,150
probably supposed to go here
anyway where are we we haven't tried

6070
02:54:27,150 --> 02:54:27,160
anyway where are we we haven't tried
 

6071
02:54:27,160 --> 02:54:30,630
anyway where are we we haven't tried
this but that's just a rate to return

6072
02:54:30,630 --> 02:54:30,640
this but that's just a rate to return
 

6073
02:54:30,640 --> 02:54:36,150

perhaps ooh the armadillo

6074
02:54:36,150 --> 02:54:36,160

 

6075
02:54:36,160 --> 02:54:40,389

place should I just try placing them or

6076
02:54:40,389 --> 02:54:40,399
place should I just try placing them or
 

6077
02:54:40,399 --> 02:54:41,990

I feel like there's a fourth one let me

6078
02:54:41,990 --> 02:54:42,000

turn this

6080
02:54:44,850 --> 02:54:44,860

them ever again afterwards I really wish
 

6093
02:55:04,359 --> 02:55:05,950
them ever again afterwards I really wish
there was a way to get rid of them

6094

so oh I was originally planning to do

13748
06:30:18,948 --> 06:30:18,958
so oh I was originally planning to do
 

13749
06:30:18,958 --> 06:30:22,670
so oh I was originally planning to do
bloopers again but um I feel like I

13750
06:30:22,670 --> 06:30:22,680
bloopers again but um I feel like I
 

13751
06:30:22,680 --> 06:30:24,708
bloopers again but um I feel like I
would have had I already like I did

13752
06:30:24,708 --> 06:30:24,718
would have had I already like I did
 

13753

but I think now my director has moved on

13756
06:30:30,628 --> 06:30:30,638
but I think now my director has moved on
 

13757
06:30:30,638 --> 06:30:34,150
but I think now my director has moved on
without uh like preparing the bloopers

13758

so asking now is probably a little bit

13760
06:30:36,750 --> 06:30:36,760
so asking now is probably a little bit
 

13761
06:30:36,760 --> 06:30:38,000
so asking now is probably a little bit
too

13762
