00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:45,029
I have already given up on my dream of saying goodbye. I am lured by a smell that I have

inside the box is a dull loneliness that feels a little cheap,

00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,469
inside the box is a dull loneliness that feels a little cheap,

16
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:16,390

but I thought I hid it without knowing it.Those

but I thought I hid it without knowing it.Those
 

18
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,830
but I thought I hid it without knowing it.Those
eyes that lurk deep inside I know it's just a joke.  Let's

00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:22,840
eyes that lurk deep inside I know it's just a joke.  Let's
 

20
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:30,190
eyes that lurk deep inside I know it's just a joke.  Let's
fly away with all the thoughts I can't see

fly away with all the thoughts I can't see
 

22
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:36,749
fly away with all the thoughts I can't see
anymore.I won't let go of you, who I've locked away without hesitation.And eventually,

00:01:36,749 --> 00:01:36,759
anymore.I won't let go of you, who I've locked away without hesitation.And eventually,

anymore.I won't let go of you, who I've locked away without hesitation.And eventually,
even if I say it's a lie, I'll start to flutter away.I've given up

25
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:44,200
even if I say it's a lie, I'll start to flutter away.I've given up
 

26
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:50,789
even if I say it's a lie, I'll start to flutter away.I've given up
on the white dream.I've been doing it for a long time, but I'm

touched by a smell and fall.  I was struggling, feeling like I was going to

00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:58,840

 

30
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:09,029

33
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:22,430

collapse under the weight of the words that were clinging to me, even though they didn't mean anything.I

00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:22,440
collapse under the weight of the words that were clinging to me, even though they didn't mean anything.I

collapse under the weight of the words that were clinging to me, even though they didn't mean anything.I

37
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:30,270

didn't realize that I was doing it.I was trying to destroy everything.  That's

38

didn't realize that I was doing it.I was trying to destroy everything.  That's
 

39
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,910
didn't realize that I was doing it.I was trying to destroy everything.  That's
all there is to the great compensation of the sweetness of the

all there is to the great compensation of the sweetness of the
sweetness that swoops down

sweetness that swoops down
 

43
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:49,110
sweetness that swoops down
and doesn't get lost, and you don't let go.It turns out to be a lie, but the

white dream that flutters and wakes up has already
given up.It's a scent that won't bring me back.  When I touch you, I'm

falling, and I can't get out. I've
 

51
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:13,270
falling, and I can't get out. I've
locked you up. I

52
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:13,280
locked you up. I

won't talk about it. Even if I end up going home, I'll

I tried my best. I

75
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:26,800
I tried my best. I
 

76
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,350
I tried my best. I
came to see that guy's cat.

77
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:31,360
came to see that guy's cat.
 

78
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,029
came to see that guy's cat.
Yay, the cat that came to me is cute. I've

79
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:36,039
Yay, the cat that came to me is cute. I've
 

80
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:39,070
Yay, the cat that came to me is cute. I've
been really into cats for a long time now. I'm

81
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:39,080
been really into cats for a long time now. I'm
 

82
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:44,350
been really into cats for a long time now. I'm
petting the pooping cat, which is really bad.  Well,

83
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:44,360
petting the pooping cat, which is really bad.  Well,
 

84
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,430
petting the pooping cat, which is really bad.  Well,
my cat seems to be

85
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:47,440
my cat seems to be
 

86
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,590
my cat seems to be
smaller than Kiawan's,

87
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:49,600
smaller than Kiawan's,
 

88
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,830
smaller than Kiawan's,
so I'm starting to think that Japanese cats

89
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:53,840
so I'm starting to think that Japanese cats
 

90
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,749
so I'm starting to think that Japanese cats
are basically smaller.

91
00:04:56,749 --> 00:04:56,759
are basically smaller.
 

92
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:00,629
are basically smaller.
Yeah, it's true. That's true even in a child like that,

93
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:00,639
Yeah, it's true. That's true even in a child like that,
 

94
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,550
Yeah, it's true. That's true even in a child like that,
right? Girl.  Well, when I look at the other members' cats,

95
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:04,560
right? Girl.  Well, when I look at the other members' cats,

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,670
right? Girl.  Well, when I look at the other members' cats,
they all seem so small.By the way,

they all seem so small.By the way,
 

98
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,350
they all seem so small.By the way,
everyone is curious and Japanese people

99
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:11,360
everyone is curious and Japanese people
 

100
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,270
everyone is curious and Japanese people
say that my room is dirty.

101
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:14,280

102
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,550

n't think there are many things like that. But I don't really think it's dirty. I do

true to a certain extent,
 

122
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,749
true to a certain extent,
but it's true that there may be a little too much stuff,

but it's true that there may be a little too much stuff,
 

124
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,870
but it's true that there may be a little too much stuff,
but I guess that can't be helped.If I

00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:02,880
but I guess that can't be helped.If I
 

126
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,909
but I guess that can't be helped.If I
could do it without advance notice, I'd scream a little,

127
00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:05,919
could do it without advance notice, I'd scream a little,
 

128
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,670
could do it without advance notice, I'd scream a little,
so I might not be able to do it.No, it's okay, it's

I were on the way there, and I had a
 

134
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:21,309
I were on the way there, and I had a
dance lesson the other day before I started streaming, so I didn't have

135
00:06:21,309 --> 00:06:21,319
dance lesson the other day before I started streaming, so I didn't have
 

136
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:24,749
dance lesson the other day before I started streaming, so I didn't have
time to eat in between,

137
00:06:24,749 --> 00:06:24,759
time to eat in between,
 

138
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,469
time to eat in between,
so I asked if I had any snacks.  They

139

so I asked if I had any snacks.  They
 

140

made a lot of food, but when I

made a lot of food, but when I

looked at it, I saw that there were so many things I couldn't eat.Well,
Chiara and I don't have the same taste in food, so we

145
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:39,440
Chiara and I don't have the same taste in food, so we
 

146
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,350
Chiara and I don't have the same taste in food, so we
don't fit together.Yes, I was in the mood for raw fish today,

1135
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,549

cat who probably gets scared when that dog is around, but this one runs away from high places, so dogs can't jump high, so it's a win for this cat.  Well, that's right.

01:34:22,520 --> 01:34:26,390
that's how it is.  I
think it's interesting how Japanese people write the lyrics,

2548
01:34:26,390 --> 01:34:26,400
think it's interesting how Japanese people write the lyrics,
 

2549
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:29,070
think it's interesting how Japanese people write the lyrics,
because they don't have it in English.That's

2550
01:34:29,070 --> 01:34:29,080
because they don't have it in English.That's
 

2551
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:32,510
because they don't have it in English.That's
right, even though they write kanji in kanji, they

2552
01:34:32,510 --> 01:34:32,520
right, even though they write kanji in kanji, they
 

2553
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:37,470
right, even though they write kanji in kanji, they
read it in a completely different way.  There

2554
01:34:37,470 --> 01:34:37,480
read it in a completely different way.  There
 

2555
01:34:37,480 --> 01:34:40,189
read it in a completely different way.  There
are quite a few things that aren't the normal way to read it.Sometimes,

01:34:40,189 --> 01:34:40,199
are quite a few things that aren't the normal way to read it.Sometimes,

2732
01:40:12,790 --> 01:40:12,800

Japan.  There's something about Japan that seems
 

2804
01:42:22,350 --> 01:42:22,360

 

2805
01:42:22,360 --> 01:42:25,669

even worse. Energy drinks have a certain law. They don't last very well, so they

2806
01:42:25,669 --> 01:42:25,679
even worse. Energy drinks have a certain law. They don't last very well, so they
 

2807
01:42:25,679 --> 01:42:28,950
even worse. Energy drinks have a certain law. They don't last very well, so they
can't make them strong, but they're too weak. They're weak.

2808
01:42:28,950 --> 01:42:28,960
can't make them strong, but they're too weak. They're weak.

Yeah, that Japanese thing doesn't work at

2810
01:42:31,550 --> 01:42:31,560
Yeah, that Japanese thing doesn't work at
 

2811
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:34,910
Yeah, that Japanese thing doesn't work at
all. It doesn't work. It doesn't work at all. I'm the type of person who listens even if it's just a little bit,

2812
01:42:34,910 --> 01:42:34,920
all. It doesn't work. It doesn't work at all. I'm the type of person who listens even if it's just a little bit,
 

2813
01:42:34,920 --> 01:42:37,510
all. It doesn't work. It doesn't work at all. I'm the type of person who listens even if it's just a little bit,
but I

2814
01:42:37,510 --> 01:42:37,520
but I
 

2815
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:40,149
but I
think it's weak. It's

2816
01:42:40,149 --> 01:42:40,159
think it's weak. It's
 

2817
01:42:40,159 --> 01:42:43,709
think it's weak. It's
been nerfed, but I often drink alcohol too.  You

2818
01:42:43,709 --> 01:42:43,719
been nerfed, but I often drink alcohol too.  You
 

2819
01:42:43,719 --> 01:42:46,550
been nerfed, but I often drink alcohol too.  You
say it's low, but that's not true. I

2820
01:42:46,550 --> 01:42:46,560
say it's low, but that's not true. I
 

2821
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:49,990
say it's low, but that's not true. I
wonder if it's because Japanese people

2822
01:42:49,990 --> 01:42:50,000
wonder if it's because Japanese people
 

2823
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:53,109
wonder if it's because Japanese people
generally don't have a strong tolerance for alcohol. I do

2824
01:42:53,109 --> 01:42:56,229
generally don't have a strong tolerance for alcohol. I do
 

2825
01:42:56,229 --> 01:42:56,239

 

2826
01:42:56,239 --> 01:43:00,229

n't drink when my friends from overseas come to Japan.  Lazy  I was

2827
01:43:00,229 --> 01:43:02,990
n't drink when my friends from overseas come to Japan.  Lazy  I was
 

2828
01:43:02,990 --> 01:43:03,000

 

2829
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,950

told that I could make it about twice as strong as this one, which is extremely weak,

2830
01:43:05,950 --> 01:43:05,960
told that I could make it about twice as strong as this one, which is extremely weak,
 

2831
01:43:05,960 --> 01:43:09,470
told that I could make it about twice as strong as this one, which is extremely weak,
so I thought that would be weak as well.I don't drink alcohol at all,

2832
01:43:09,470 --> 01:43:09,480
so I thought that would be weak as well.I don't drink alcohol at all,
 

2833
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:11,910
so I thought that would be weak as well.I don't drink alcohol at all,
so I can't say much about that, but it seems

2834
01:43:11,910 --> 01:43:11,920
so I can't say much about that, but it seems
 

2835
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:14,550
so I can't say much about that, but it seems
likely.

2836
01:43:14,550 --> 01:43:14,560
likely.
 

2837
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:17,589
likely.

2838
