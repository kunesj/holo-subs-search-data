559
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,650
noise and I couldn't
so that was so funny to myself and I was

560
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:42,660
so that was so funny to myself and I was
 

561
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,909
so that was so funny to myself and I was
trying to hold back my life because

562
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:43,919
trying to hold back my life because
 

563
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,669

um so then I guess it sounded a little

568
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:52,500
um so then I guess it sounded a little
 

569
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,830
um so then I guess it sounded a little
bit like I was like throwing up or so

570
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:54,840
bit like I was like throwing up or so
 

571
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,510
bit like I was like throwing up or so
because Mew said it was like is she

02:55:19,859 --> 02:55:23,690
another like real looking cat face just
like a pixel cat face and it would bring

5965
02:55:23,690 --> 02:55:23,700
like a pixel cat face and it would bring

02:55:26,939 --> 02:55:29,210
the dishes to the tables
because there was like a tray inside the

02:55:29,210 --> 02:55:29,220
because there was like a tray inside the
 

5970
02:55:29,220 --> 02:55:33,290
because there was like a tray inside the
robot and I guess the kitchen would put

robot and I guess the kitchen would put
 

5972
02:55:33,300 --> 02:55:35,690

the food in there and then the robot

5973
02:55:35,690 --> 02:55:35,700
the food in there and then the robot
 

5974
02:55:35,700 --> 02:55:38,450
