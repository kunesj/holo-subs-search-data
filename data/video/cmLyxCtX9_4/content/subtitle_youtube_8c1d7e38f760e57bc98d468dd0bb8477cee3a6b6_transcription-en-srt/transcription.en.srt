um
so it doesn't line up like when even

348
00:14:25,189 --> 00:14:25,199
so it doesn't line up like when even
 

349
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,590
so it doesn't line up like when even
when i make it line up at one point once

350
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:27,600
when i make it line up at one point once
 

351
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,310
when i make it line up at one point once
i go down then it's like not lining up

352
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:30,320
i go down then it's like not lining up
 

353
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,710
i go down then it's like not lining up
there anymore

354
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:32,720
there anymore
 

355
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,590
there anymore
so

356
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:33,600
so
 

357
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,590
so
i have to figure it out i think if i if

358
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:35,600

like if it's if if i cut it here it

538
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:15,280
like if it's if if i cut it here it
 

539
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,710
like if it's if if i cut it here it
would look okay

540
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:16,720
would look okay
 

541
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,270
would look okay
but yeah i i can't i can't i don't know

542
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:19,280
but yeah i i can't i can't i don't know
 

543
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,710
but yeah i i can't i can't i don't know
about the size man um

544
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:22,720
about the size man um
 

545
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,669
about the size man um
hmm it's so cool to see yeah wait what

are the same size

are the same size
 

593
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,510
are the same size
like this then it should it should let's

594
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:33,520
like this then it should it should let's
 

595
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,110
like this then it should it should let's
say i'm in the corner yes i'm in

596
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:37,120
say i'm in the corner yes i'm in
 

597
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,669
say i'm in the corner yes i'm in
let's say this corner

598
00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:39,679
let's say this corner
 

599
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:40,950
let's say this corner
yeah

600
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:40,960
yeah
 

601
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,470
yeah
here

602
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:42,480
here
 

603
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,710
here
that pretty much lines up if if both

604
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:44,720
that pretty much lines up if if both
 

605
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,870
that pretty much lines up if if both
windows are the same size of course but

606
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:46,880
windows are the same size of course but
 

607
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,710
windows are the same size of course but
now let's say

608
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:50,720

 

609
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,830

let's say

610
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:53,840
let's say
 

611
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,230
let's say
say

612
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:56,240

 

613
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,549

because i also wanted to fit on that big

614
00:19:58,549 --> 00:19:58,559
because i also wanted to fit on that big
 

615
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,070
because i also wanted to fit on that big
screen but i guess it doesn't really

616
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:00,080
screen but i guess it doesn't really
 

617
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,909
screen but i guess it doesn't really
matter

618
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:01,919
matter
 

619
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,830
matter
i guess we could just

620
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:04,840
i guess we could just
 

621
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,950
i guess we could just
um say goodbye to the big screen

622
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:08,960
um say goodbye to the big screen
 

623
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,549
um say goodbye to the big screen
and then

624
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:10,559
and then
 

625
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:11,350
and then
make

626
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:11,360
make
 

627
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,789
make
oh dear what the [\h__\h]

628
00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:14,799

 

629
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,350

oh damn it damn it

630
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:17,360
oh damn it damn it
 

631
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,029
oh damn it damn it
no this and this huh

632
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:21,039
no this and this huh
 

633
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,909
no this and this huh
why can't i only move one at a time

634
00:20:23,909 --> 00:20:23,919
why can't i only move one at a time
 

635
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,510
why can't i only move one at a time
shut them up

636
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:25,520
shut them up
 

637
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,510
shut them up
no i don't want it to be full screen

638
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:29,520

 

639
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,270

wait wait wait whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

640
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:31,280
wait wait wait whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
 

641
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,510

643
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,510
whoa whoa
let's say

644
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:35,520
let's say
 

645
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,669
let's say
it is bigger

646
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:37,679
it is bigger
 

647
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,750
it is bigger
okay we'll just do it like this

648
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:39,760
okay we'll just do it like this
 

649
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,110
okay we'll just do it like this
and then

650
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:43,120

 

651
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,350

yeah i just i'll just keep the sides i

652
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:45,360
yeah i just i'll just keep the sides i
 

653
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,110
yeah i just i'll just keep the sides i
guess you can see

654
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:47,120
guess you can see
 

655
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,950
guess you can see
it i guess

656
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:48,960
it i guess
 

657
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,350
it i guess
so now

658
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:51,360
so now
 

659
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,190
so now
now the window sizes are roughly the

660
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:53,200
now the window sizes are roughly the
 

661
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,230
now the window sizes are roughly the
same

662
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:54,240
same
 

663
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,510
same
corner uh almost down huh

664
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:57,520
corner uh almost down huh
 

665
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,870
corner uh almost down huh
corner

666
00:20:58,870 --> 00:20:58,880

667
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,990

corner yeah yeah yeah i'm not that

668
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:02,000
corner yeah yeah yeah i'm not that
 

669
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,669
corner yeah yeah yeah i'm not that
actually works

670
00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:03,679
actually works
 

671
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:15,430
actually works
i guess that works

anything from me
 

677
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,350
anything from me
because like i i don't even know like

678
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:21,360
because like i i don't even know like
 

679
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,549
because like i i don't even know like
how i don't know these brushes i i

how i don't know these brushes i i
 

681
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,630
how i don't know these brushes i i
i have not really had much opportunity

i have not really had much opportunity
 

683
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,350
i have not really had much opportunity
to experiment with them so that's that

684
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:29,360
to experiment with them so that's that
 

685
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,430
to experiment with them so that's that
also i want to

686
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:31,440
also i want to
 

687
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,909
also i want to
make myself

688
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:33,919
make myself
 

689
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,669
make myself
like here

690

4585
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:42,790
the only member i have left in third gen
is pecora senpai and

4586
01:52:42,790 --> 01:52:42,800
is pecora senpai and
 

4587
01:52:42,800 --> 01:52:45,270
is pecora senpai and
i'm nervous about it

4588

i'm nervous about it
 

4589
01:52:45,280 --> 01:52:47,510
i'm nervous about it
and and then there's two other members

4590
01:52:47,510 --> 01:52:47,520
and and then there's two other members
 

4591
01:52:47,520 --> 01:52:50,229
and and then there's two other members
that are from before verge and that are

4592
01:52:50,229 --> 01:52:50,239
that are from before verge and that are
 

4593
01:52:50,239 --> 01:52:52,070
that are from before verge and that are
a little bit hard to get so i've been

4594
01:52:52,070 --> 01:52:52,080
a little bit hard to get so i've been
 

4595
01:52:52,080 --> 01:52:53,750
a little bit hard to get so i've been
struggling with that too

4596
01:52:53,750 --> 01:52:53,760
struggling with that too
 

4597
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:54,950
struggling with that too
so

4598
01:52:54,950 --> 01:52:54,960
so
 

4599
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:56,550
so
the members i have

4600
01:52:56,550 --> 01:52:56,560
the members i have
 

4601
01:52:56,560 --> 01:52:59,430
the members i have
at my disposal right now

4602
01:52:59,430 --> 01:52:59,440
at my disposal right now
 

4603
01:52:59,440 --> 01:53:01,750
at my disposal right now
are all kind of difficult in some way or

4604
01:53:01,750 --> 01:53:01,760
are all kind of difficult in some way or
 

4605
01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:03,750
are all kind of difficult in some way or
never

4606
01:53:03,750 --> 01:53:03,760
never
 

4607
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:07,910
never
and and then then then i figured out um

4608
01:53:07,910 --> 01:53:07,920
and and then then then i figured out um
 

4609
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:09,669
and and then then then i figured out um
the other day that

4610

the other day that
 

4611
01:53:09,679 --> 01:53:10,629
the other day that
um

4612
01:53:10,629 --> 01:53:10,639
um
 

4613
01:53:10,639 --> 01:53:13,430

01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:17,030
in 3d
um

4620
01:53:17,030 --> 01:53:17,040
um
 

4621
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:18,470
um
so i wanted to use that for whole talk

4622
01:53:18,470 --> 01:53:18,480
so i wanted to use that for whole talk
 

4623
01:53:18,480 --> 01:53:21,990
so i wanted to use that for whole talk
but then i realized that is actually

4624
01:53:21,990 --> 01:53:22,000
but then i realized that is actually
 

4625
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:25,030
but then i realized that is actually
we can't do it in collabs yet

4626
01:53:25,030 --> 01:53:25,040
we can't do it in collabs yet
 

4627
01:53:25,040 --> 01:53:27,669
we can't do it in collabs yet
don't don't ask why

4628
01:53:27,669 --> 01:53:27,679
don't don't ask why
 

4629
01:53:27,679 --> 01:53:29,910
don't don't ask why
technical things

4630
01:53:29,910 --> 01:53:29,920
technical things
 

4631
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:30,790
technical things
so

4632
01:53:30,790 --> 01:53:30,800
so
 

4633
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:32,709
so
i can't make use of it and i was like oh

4634
01:53:32,709 --> 01:53:32,719
i can't make use of it and i was like oh
 

4635
01:53:32,719 --> 01:53:34,470
i can't make use of it and i was like oh
maybe i should wait until they implement

4636
01:53:34,470 --> 01:53:34,480
maybe i should wait until they implement
 

4637
01:53:34,480 --> 01:53:36,790
maybe i should wait until they implement
it so we can use it in collabs but

4638
01:53:36,790 --> 01:53:36,800
it so we can use it in collabs but
 

4639
01:53:36,800 --> 01:53:39,350
it so we can use it in collabs but
that will probably take months months

4640
01:53:39,350 --> 01:53:39,360
that will probably take months months
 

4641
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:41,510

6549
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:29,750
year um also because they're selling
more tickets
