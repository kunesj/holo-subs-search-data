ohio was probably um

8196
03:25:29,830 --> 03:25:29,840
ohio was probably um
 

8197
03:25:29,840 --> 03:25:31,670
ohio was probably um
one of the most

8198
03:25:31,670 --> 03:25:31,680
one of the most
 

8199
03:25:31,680 --> 03:25:33,910
one of the most
intricate choreos that i did but the

8200
03:25:33,910 --> 03:25:33,920
intricate choreos that i did but the
 

8201
03:25:33,920 --> 03:25:36,710
intricate choreos that i did but the
good thing is with kenya in ohio

8202
03:25:36,710 --> 03:25:36,720
good thing is with kenya in ohio
 

8203
03:25:36,720 --> 03:25:38,790
good thing is with kenya in ohio
i already knew that choreo since a long

8204
03:25:38,790 --> 03:25:38,800
i already knew that choreo since a long
 

8205
03:25:38,800 --> 03:25:39,910
i already knew that choreo since a long
time ago

8206
03:25:39,910 --> 03:25:39,920
time ago
 

8207
03:25:39,920 --> 03:25:41,030
time ago
so

8208
03:25:41,030 --> 03:25:41,040
so
 

8209
03:25:41,040 --> 03:25:43,429
so
that one was actually the easiest for me

8210
03:25:43,429 --> 03:25:43,439
that one was actually the easiest for me
 

8211
03:25:43,439 --> 03:25:46,150
that one was actually the easiest for me
i was the most used to it which is maybe

8212
03:25:46,150 --> 03:25:46,160
i was the most used to it which is maybe
 

8213
03:25:46,160 --> 03:25:48,469
i was the most used to it which is maybe
also why it it might have been one of

8214
03:25:48,469 --> 03:25:48,479
also why it it might have been one of
 

8215
03:25:48,479 --> 03:25:52,070
also why it it might have been one of
the best looking dancers i did

8216
03:25:52,070 --> 03:25:52,080
the best looking dancers i did
 

8217

8225
03:26:01,200 --> 03:26:03,830
yes a director's cut is needed because
for my own satisfaction and because i

8226
03:26:03,830 --> 03:26:03,840
for my own satisfaction and because i
 

8227
03:26:03,840 --> 03:26:06,309
for my own satisfaction and because i
think kfp at least will watch it but i i

8228
03:26:06,309 --> 03:26:06,319

i also uh
 

8233
03:26:10,560 --> 03:26:12,710
i also uh
i think probably mostly

8234
03:26:12,710 --> 03:26:12,720
i think probably mostly
 

8235
03:26:12,720 --> 03:26:15,910
i think probably mostly
yeah it will be kfp watching

8236
03:26:15,910 --> 03:26:15,920
yeah it will be kfp watching
 

8237
03:26:15,920 --> 03:26:20,070
yeah it will be kfp watching
but yeah that's okay

8238
03:26:20,070 --> 03:26:20,080

 

8239
03:26:20,080 --> 03:26:22,229

oh [\h__\h] that doesn't work the way i

9108
03:47:24,309 --> 03:47:24,319

9109
03:47:24,319 --> 03:47:26,550

data for the concert i can just reuse

9110
03:47:26,550 --> 03:47:26,560

9111
03:47:26,560 --> 03:47:28,469

that probably

9112
03:47:28,469 --> 03:47:28,479
that probably
 

9113
03:47:28,479 --> 03:47:31,590
that probably
because it will be difficult for me to

9114
03:47:31,590 --> 03:47:31,600
because it will be difficult for me to
 

9115
03:47:31,600 --> 03:47:35,830
because it will be difficult for me to
record something again

9116
03:47:35,830 --> 03:47:35,840

 

9117
03:47:35,840 --> 03:47:39,990

9119
03:47:40,000 --> 03:47:47,830

good thing is one can reuse the data
