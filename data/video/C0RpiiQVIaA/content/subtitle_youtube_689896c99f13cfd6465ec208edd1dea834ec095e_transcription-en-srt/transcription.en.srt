beginning yeah there's four rolls there

544
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:23,600
beginning yeah there's four rolls there
 

545
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,990
beginning yeah there's four rolls there
I don't know you girls can probably see

546
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:25,000
I don't know you girls can probably see
 

547
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,029
I don't know you girls can probably see
them in the settings uh on the on the

548
00:19:27,029 --> 00:19:27,039
them in the settings uh on the on the
 

549
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,710
them in the settings uh on the on the
computer here there's scientist who can

550
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:29,720
computer here there's scientist who can
 

551
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,909
computer here there's scientist who can
access a portable vitals panel so they

552
00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:31,919
access a portable vitals panel so they
 

553
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,270
access a portable vitals panel so they
can check at any point of time if

554
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:34,280
can check at any point of time if
 

555
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,510
can check at any point of time if
there's somebody dead so they always see

556
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:36,520
there's somebody dead so they always see
 

557
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,909
there's somebody dead so they always see
the status of the crew and then there's

558
00:19:38,909 --> 00:19:38,919
the status of the crew and then there's
 

559
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:41,789
the status of the crew and then there's
an engineer who can use the vents even

560
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:41,799
an engineer who can use the vents even
 

561
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:43,430
an engineer who can use the vents even
though they're not an impostor but then

562
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:43,440
though they're not an impostor but then
 

563
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,710
though they're not an impostor but then
you might be sus you have to be like I'm

564
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:45,720
you might be sus you have to be like I'm
 

565
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,669
you might be sus you have to be like I'm
not the impostor I just vent because I

566
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:47,679
not the impostor I just vent because I
 

567
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,669
not the impostor I just vent because I
can oh that's pretty cool really and

568
00:19:50,669 --> 00:19:50,679
can oh that's pretty cool really and
 

569

can oh that's pretty cool really and
then the guardian angel uh is the ghost

570
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:53,320
then the guardian angel uh is the ghost
 

571
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,510
then the guardian angel uh is the ghost
of the very first one of us that

572
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:56,520
of the very first one of us that
 

573
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,669
of the very first one of us that
dies uh is that how it work works the

574
00:19:58,669 --> 00:19:58,679
dies uh is that how it work works the
 

575
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:00,230
dies uh is that how it work works the
first person that dies yeah something

576
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:00,240
first person that dies yeah something
 

577
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,510
first person that dies yeah something
like that the garden it says the ghost

00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:04,240
of the first Dead crew mate they can
 

581
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,390
of the first Dead crew mate they can
temporarily shield and protect other

582
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:06,400
temporarily shield and protect other
 

583
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,310
temporarily shield and protect other
living crewmates oh yeah so I guess if

584
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:08,320
living crewmates oh yeah so I guess if
 

585
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,870
living crewmates oh yeah so I guess if
you're the first one that dies you

586
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:09,880
you're the first one that dies you
 

587
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,710
you're the first one that dies you
become the guardian angel and then you

588
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:11,720
become the guardian angel and then you
 

589
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,710
become the guardian angel and then you
can protect somebody else so that don't

590
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:14,720
can protect somebody else so that don't
 

591
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,510
can protect somebody else so that don't
die yeah if you do it properly and well

592
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:18,520
die yeah if you do it properly and well
 

593
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,669
die yeah if you do it properly and well
timed you'll be able to prevent

00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:19,679
timed you'll be able to prevent
 

595
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,149
timed you'll be able to prevent
imposters from killing their victims

596
00:20:21,149 --> 00:20:21,159
imposters from killing their victims
 

597
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:24,070
imposters from killing their victims
sounds amazing me throwing so that I can

say so so wait does only one impostor is
 

641
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,909
say so so wait does only one impostor is
only one imposter The Shape Shifter is

642
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:21,919
only one imposter The Shape Shifter is
 

643
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,990
only one imposter The Shape Shifter is
that how it works oh I can set how many

644
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:24,000
that how it works oh I can set how many
 

645
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,590
that how it works oh I can set how many
there will be I can say is that how it

646
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:26,600
there will be I can say is that how it
 

647
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,350
there will be I can say is that how it
works I can say want two or I can say we

648
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:29,360
works I can say want two or I can say we
 

649
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,789
works I can say want two or I can say we
I want one or zero I can set it in the

650
00:21:33,789 --> 00:21:33,799
I want one or zero I can set it in the
 

651
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:36,590
I want one or zero I can set it in the
settings but if I do one then only one

00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:36,600
settings but if I do one then only one
 

653
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,070
settings but if I do one then only one
of the uh imposters will be Shape

654
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:39,080
of the uh imposters will be Shape
 

655
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,190
of the uh imposters will be Shape
Shifter but only 50% chance the one will

656
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:42,200
