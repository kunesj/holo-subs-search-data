00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:17,440
this bugged me a lot
 

613
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,749
this bugged me a lot
quite a lot because she could have just

614
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:19,759
quite a lot because she could have just
 

615
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,150
quite a lot because she could have just
blocked it with the with the bishop it

616
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:22,160
blocked it with the with the bishop it
 

617
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,990
blocked it with the with the bishop it
would be a lot more efficient the king

618

would be a lot more efficient the king
 

619
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,590
would be a lot more efficient the king
would have to move and then maybe she'd

620

would have to move and then maybe she'd
 

621
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,350
would have to move and then maybe she'd
have a chance to actually castle over

622

have a chance to actually castle over
 

623
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,949
