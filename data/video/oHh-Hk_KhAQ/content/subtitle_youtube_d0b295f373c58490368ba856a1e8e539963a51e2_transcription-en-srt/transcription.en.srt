02:40:03,830 --> 02:40:03,840
it will take
 

4011
02:40:03,840 --> 02:40:06,349
it will take
a really big portion

4012
02:40:06,349 --> 02:40:06,359
a really big portion
 

4013
02:40:06,359 --> 02:40:07,790
a really big portion
of

4014
02:40:07,790 --> 02:40:07,800
of
 

4015
02:40:07,800 --> 02:40:11,710
of
my income so I'd rather have that

4016
02:40:11,710 --> 02:40:11,720
my income so I'd rather have that
 

4017
02:40:11,720 --> 02:40:14,809
my income so I'd rather have that
allocated to a very meaningful project

4018
02:40:14,809 --> 02:40:14,819
allocated to a very meaningful project
 

4019
02:40:14,819 --> 02:40:16,730

instead
 

4021
02:40:16,740 --> 02:40:19,610
instead
so that is very expensive

4022
02:40:19,610 --> 02:40:19,620
so that is very expensive
 

4023
02:40:19,620 --> 02:40:21,770
so that is very expensive
I think it's going to be like more more

02:40:24,950 --> 02:40:24,960
than half of my income actually so it's
