problem really let me before we do

2068
01:16:08,930 --> 01:16:08,940
problem really let me before we do
 

2069
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:11,450

anything with the ramp let's let's uh

2070
01:16:11,450 --> 01:16:11,460
anything with the ramp let's let's uh
 

2071
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:21,169
anything with the ramp let's let's uh
let's experiment okay

2072
01:16:21,169 --> 01:16:21,179

 

2073

2077
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:39,550

no how did I do that

2078
01:16:39,550 --> 01:16:39,560

 

2079
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:42,410

I think like it's falling down is good

2080
01:16:42,410 --> 01:16:42,420
I think like it's falling down is good
 

2081
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:45,050
I think like it's falling down is good
because it gives it like a bump

2082
01:16:45,050 --> 01:16:45,060
because it gives it like a bump
 

2083
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:46,430
because it gives it like a bump
uh-huh

7181
03:45:16,389 --> 03:45:16,399
for myself
 

7182
03:45:16,399 --> 03:45:19,309

then I could still go elsewhere to pet

7183
03:45:19,309 --> 03:45:19,319
then I could still go elsewhere to pet
 

7184
03:45:19,319 --> 03:45:20,450

so

7187
03:45:24,170 --> 03:45:24,180

 

7188
03:45:24,180 --> 03:45:27,650

that would break my heart but if it was

7197
03:45:37,309 --> 03:45:37,319
that would break my heart but if it was
 

7198
03:45:37,319 --> 03:45:40,130
that would break my heart but if it was
before I got them and there was still

7199
03:45:40,130 --> 03:45:40,140
before I got them and there was still
 

7200
03:45:40,140 --> 03:45:43,610
before I got them and there was still
cats elsewhere that I could touch

7201
03:45:43,610 --> 03:45:43,620
cats elsewhere that I could touch
 

7202
03:45:43,620 --> 03:45:49,130
cats elsewhere that I could touch
then I would go for that option
