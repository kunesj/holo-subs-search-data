for real I feel like there's space for

7676
03:53:47,630 --> 03:53:47,640
for real I feel like there's space for
 

7677
03:53:47,640 --> 03:53:52,070
for real I feel like there's space for
it though

7678
03:53:52,070 --> 03:53:52,080

 

7679
03:53:52,080 --> 03:53:55,670

it's still doing the wee-wee
 

7683
03:53:58,439 --> 03:54:01,010
it's still doing the wee-wee
maybe if I turn it again this time it

7684
03:54:01,010 --> 03:54:01,020
maybe if I turn it again this time it
 

7685
03:54:01,020 --> 03:54:04,190
maybe if I turn it again this time it
will lead us over there

7686
03:54:04,190 --> 03:54:04,200

 

7687
03:54:04,200 --> 03:54:10,070

I wonder

7688
03:54:10,070 --> 03:54:10,080

 

7689
03:54:10,080 --> 03:54:11,389

no
 

7691
03:54:11,399 --> 03:54:14,389
no
oh well at least I put things back where

7692
03:54:14,389 --> 03:54:14,399
oh well at least I put things back where
 

7693
03:54:14,399 --> 03:54:16,790
oh well at least I put things back where
they were

7694
03:54:16,790 --> 03:54:16,800
they were
 

7695
03:54:16,800 --> 03:54:18,830
they were
or should I not wait but that acts as a

7696
03:54:18,830 --> 03:54:18,840
or should I not wait but that acts as a
 

7697
03:54:18,840 --> 03:54:21,650
or should I not wait but that acts as a
platform

7698
03:54:21,650 --> 03:54:21,660

 

7699
03:54:21,660 --> 03:54:24,969

that kind of acts as a platform

7700
03:54:24,969 --> 03:54:24,979
that kind of acts as a platform
 

7701
03:54:24,979 --> 03:54:29,090
that kind of acts as a platform
for grapple hook maybe even but uh

7702
03:54:29,090 --> 03:54:29,100
for grapple hook maybe even but uh
 

7703

dual control force field is online the
 

7723
03:55:07,319 --> 03:55:12,889
dual control force field is online the
activation controls are likely nearby

7724
03:55:12,889 --> 03:55:12,899

 

7725
03:55:12,899 --> 03:55:17,689

12291
06:21:25,980 --> 06:21:28,250

but I feel like I'm maybe worse at
 

12293
06:21:28,260 --> 06:21:30,830
but I feel like I'm maybe worse at
platforming when it's

12294
06:21:30,830 --> 06:21:30,840
platforming when it's
 

12295
06:21:30,840 --> 06:21:32,030
platforming when it's
not

I feel like the fact that this first
 

12301
06:21:38,940 --> 06:21:41,570
I feel like the fact that this first

15842
08:01:48,048 --> 08:01:48,058
others with your dance with no don't say
 

15843
08:01:48,058 --> 08:01:50,090
others with your dance with no don't say
that that being said my only criticism

15844
08:01:50,090 --> 08:01:50,100
that that being said my only criticism
 

15845
08:01:50,100 --> 08:01:51,590
that that being said my only criticism
is that in both songs there wasn't

15846
08:01:51,590 --> 08:01:51,600
is that in both songs there wasn't
 

15847
08:01:51,600 --> 08:01:53,208
is that in both songs there wasn't
enough close-ups

15848
08:01:53,208 --> 08:01:53,218
enough close-ups
 

15849
08:01:53,218 --> 08:01:55,670
enough close-ups
um

15850
08:01:55,670 --> 08:01:55,680

 

15851
08:01:55,680 --> 08:01:57,770

I wouldn't say we need more close-ups

15852
08:01:57,770 --> 08:01:57,780
I wouldn't say we need more close-ups
 

15853
08:01:57,780 --> 08:01:59,448
I wouldn't say we need more close-ups
unless with close-ups you just mean like

15854
08:01:59,448 --> 08:01:59,458
unless with close-ups you just mean like
 

15855
08:01:59,458 --> 08:02:01,368
unless with close-ups you just mean like
upper body or like full body but not

15856
08:02:01,368 --> 08:02:01,378
upper body or like full body but not
 

15857
08:02:01,378 --> 08:02:03,230
upper body or like full body but not
from too far away

15858
08:02:03,230 --> 08:02:03,240
from too far away
 

15859
08:02:03,240 --> 08:02:05,388
from too far away
because close up with a close-up if it's

15860
08:02:05,388 --> 08:02:05,398
because close up with a close-up if it's
 

15861
08:02:05,398 --> 08:02:06,830
because close up with a close-up if it's
just a face then again you can't see the

15862
08:02:06,830 --> 08:02:06,840
just a face then again you can't see the
 

15863
08:02:06,840 --> 08:02:08,570
just a face then again you can't see the
dancing again and you don't see like the

15864
08:02:08,570 --> 08:02:08,580
dancing again and you don't see like the
 

15865
08:02:08,580 --> 08:02:10,310
dancing again and you don't see like the
others maybe maybe they're showing

15866
08:02:10,310 --> 08:02:10,320

15867
08:02:10,320 --> 08:02:11,990
others maybe maybe they're showing
close-up of your or she but the the

15868
08:02:11,990 --> 08:02:12,000
close-up of your or she but the the
 

15869
08:02:12,000 --> 08:02:13,730
close-up of your or she but the the
other ones are hoping for close-ups of

15870
08:02:13,730 --> 08:02:13,740
other ones are hoping for close-ups of
 

15871
08:02:13,740 --> 08:02:16,548
other ones are hoping for close-ups of
their own Oshi so I feel like generally

16002
08:05:16,070 --> 08:05:16,080
see more I mean there's someone you want
 

16003
08:05:16,080 --> 08:05:18,350
see more I mean there's someone you want
to see more right

16004
08:05:18,350 --> 08:05:18,360
to see more right
 

16005
08:05:18,360 --> 08:05:20,030
to see more right
so

16006
08:05:20,030 --> 08:05:20,040
so
 

16007
08:05:20,040 --> 08:05:25,190
so
you should give them the control over

16008
08:05:25,190 --> 08:05:25,200

 

16009
08:05:25,200 --> 08:05:26,510

where the cameras are moving to a

16010
08:05:26,510 --> 08:05:26,520
where the cameras are moving to a
 

16011
08:05:26,520 --> 08:05:27,650
where the cameras are moving to a
different position that would look bad I

16012
08:05:27,650 --> 08:05:27,660
different position that would look bad I
 

16013
08:05:27,660 --> 08:05:28,310
different position that would look bad I
mean

16014
08:05:28,310 --> 08:05:28,320
mean
 

16015
08:05:28,320 --> 08:05:30,170
mean
I mean K2

16016
08:05:30,170 --> 08:05:30,180
I mean K2
 

16017
08:05:30,180 --> 08:05:32,090
I mean K2
worst case you can cut that out and

16018
08:05:32,090 --> 08:05:32,100
worst case you can cut that out and
 

16019
08:05:32,100 --> 08:05:34,850
worst case you can cut that out and
switch to different place just for that

16020
08:05:34,850 --> 08:05:34,860
switch to different place just for that
 

16021
08:05:34,860 --> 08:05:38,388
switch to different place just for that
but I think even that is fine

16022
08:05:38,388 --> 08:05:38,398
but I think even that is fine
 

16023
08:05:38,398 --> 08:05:41,930
