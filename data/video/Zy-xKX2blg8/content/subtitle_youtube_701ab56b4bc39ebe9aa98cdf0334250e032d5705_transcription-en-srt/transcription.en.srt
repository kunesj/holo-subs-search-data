it's like roads and crossing and like
you go this path this path this path and

224
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:27,039
you go this path this path this path and
 

225
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,390
you go this path this path this path and
it's like like streets of ice and then

226
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:29,400
it's like like streets of ice and then

but then you go out into another Street
 

231
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,909
but then you go out into another Street
and that street leads to another Circle

232
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:35,919
and that street leads to another Circle
 

233
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,670
and that street leads to another Circle
and so on so it's like a I don't know

terrifying yeah guys you kind of can't
 

4188
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:06,030
terrifying yeah guys you kind of can't
you kind of can't compare the traffic in

4189
01:46:06,030 --> 01:46:06,040
you kind of can't compare the traffic in
 

4190
01:46:06,040 --> 01:46:08,990
you kind of can't compare the traffic in
like I guess like European countries or

4191
01:46:08,990 --> 01:46:09,000
like I guess like European countries or
 

4192
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,070
like I guess like European countries or
like whatever and then southeast Asia

4193
01:46:11,070 --> 01:46:11,080
like whatever and then southeast Asia
 

4194
01:46:11,080 --> 01:46:13,950
like whatever and then southeast Asia
it's just it's just different I guess

4195
01:46:13,950 --> 01:46:13,960
it's just it's just different I guess
 

4196
01:46:13,960 --> 01:46:17,629
it's just it's just different I guess
it's because mopets are are just cheaper

4197
01:46:17,629 --> 01:46:17,639
it's because mopets are are just cheaper
 

4198
01:46:17,639 --> 01:46:20,510
it's because mopets are are just cheaper
yeah I guess so yeah it's easy to get to

4199
01:46:20,510 --> 01:46:20,520
yeah I guess so yeah it's easy to get to
 

4200
01:46:20,520 --> 01:46:21,550
yeah I guess so yeah it's easy to get to
and stuff like that and if there's

4201
01:46:21,550 --> 01:46:21,560
and stuff like that and if there's
 

4202
01:46:21,560 --> 01:46:23,629
and stuff like that and if there's
already traffic jam like it's easier to

4203
01:46:23,629 --> 01:46:23,639
already traffic jam like it's easier to
 

4204
01:46:23,639 --> 01:46:25,790
already traffic jam like it's easier to
get around it with a with a motor bike

4205
01:46:25,790 --> 01:46:25,800
get around it with a with a motor bike
 

4206
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:28,109
get around it with a with a motor bike
with a motor bike so I get that I get

4207
01:46:28,109 --> 01:46:28,119
with a motor bike so I get that I get
 

4208
01:46:28,119 --> 01:46:30,709
with a motor bike so I get that I get
that yeah but even higher risk of

4209
01:46:30,709 --> 01:46:30,719
that yeah but even higher risk of
 

4210
01:46:30,719 --> 01:46:32,750
that yeah but even higher risk of
getting injured because you have nothing

4211
01:46:32,750 --> 01:46:32,760
getting injured because you have nothing
 

4212
01:46:32,760 --> 01:46:35,950
getting injured because you have nothing
around you that protects you a Mot bag

4213
01:46:35,950 --> 01:46:35,960
around you that protects you a Mot bag
 

4214
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:38,030
around you that protects you a Mot bag
