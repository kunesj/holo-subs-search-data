5351
02:23:21,680 --> 02:23:26,469
my throat he checked all of it i guess
it's all connected uh he said that um

5352
02:23:26,469 --> 02:23:26,479
it's all connected uh he said that um
 

5353
02:23:26,479 --> 02:23:29,190
it's all connected uh he said that um
uh he said they're not like inflamed or

5354
02:23:29,190 --> 02:23:29,200
uh he said they're not like inflamed or
 

5355
02:23:29,200 --> 02:23:33,349
uh he said they're not like inflamed or
anything like not in tunde it

5356
02:23:33,349 --> 02:23:33,359

 

5357
02:23:33,359 --> 02:23:35,030

he said

5358
02:23:35,030 --> 02:23:35,040
he said
 

5359
02:23:35,040 --> 02:23:36,630
he said
he made me like

5360
02:23:36,630 --> 02:23:36,640
he made me like
 

5361
02:23:36,640 --> 02:23:40,309
he made me like
make a noise when i was when he was like

5362
02:23:40,309 --> 02:23:40,319
make a noise when i was when he was like
 

5363
02:23:40,319 --> 02:23:41,990
make a noise when i was when he was like
opening my mouth

5364
02:23:41,990 --> 02:23:42,000
opening my mouth
 

5365
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,630
opening my mouth
and and i guess that resulted in him

5366
02:23:44,630 --> 02:23:44,640
and and i guess that resulted in him
 

5367
02:23:44,640 --> 02:23:47,830
and and i guess that resulted in him
saying that my my vocal cords

5368
02:23:47,830 --> 02:23:47,840
saying that my my vocal cords
 

5369
02:23:47,840 --> 02:23:51,349
saying that my my vocal cords
don't close properly when

5370
02:23:51,349 --> 02:23:51,359
don't close properly when
 

5371
02:23:51,359 --> 02:23:52,950
don't close properly when
i speak

5372
02:23:52,950 --> 02:23:52,960
i speak
 

5373
02:23:52,960 --> 02:23:54,150
i speak
i guess

5374
02:23:54,150 --> 02:23:54,160
i guess
 

5375
02:23:54,160 --> 02:23:55,750
i guess
um

5376
02:23:55,750 --> 02:23:55,760
um
 

5377
02:23:55,760 --> 02:23:56,950
um
so that

5378
02:23:56,950 --> 02:23:56,960
so that
 

5379
02:23:56,960 --> 02:23:59,429
so that
probably

5380
02:23:59,429 --> 02:23:59,439
probably
 

5381
02:23:59,439 --> 02:24:01,590
probably
i'm not sure he didn't quite say what he

5382
02:24:01,590 --> 02:24:01,600
i'm not sure he didn't quite say what he
 

5383
02:24:01,600 --> 02:24:03,830
i'm not sure he didn't quite say what he
thinks is exactly the reason because the

5384
02:24:03,830 --> 02:24:03,840
thinks is exactly the reason because the
 

5385
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:08,870
thinks is exactly the reason because the
other thing was he said that uh

5386
02:24:08,870 --> 02:24:08,880

 

5387
02:24:08,880 --> 02:24:11,349

5389
02:24:11,359 --> 02:24:13,990
i'm not very clear if just my nose and
my ears are dry or my fruit as well but

5390
02:24:13,990 --> 02:24:14,000
my ears are dry or my fruit as well but
 

5391
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,790
my ears are dry or my fruit as well but
he did say in any case that i am very

5392
02:24:16,790 --> 02:24:16,800
he did say in any case that i am very
 

5393
02:24:16,800 --> 02:24:18,389
he did say in any case that i am very
dry

which i'm surprised because i spent uh
 

5397
02:24:21,520 --> 02:24:24,070
which i'm surprised because i spent uh
the last couple days in the sauna and i

5398
02:24:24,070 --> 02:24:24,080
the last couple days in the sauna and i

02:24:36,230 --> 02:24:36,240
yeah he did say very dry so i guess it's
 

5411
02:24:36,240 --> 02:24:39,030
yeah he did say very dry so i guess it's
a maybe a combination of

needs to be fixed but if that was the

5430
02:24:56,309 --> 02:24:56,319
needs to be fixed but if that was the
 

5431
