I I had a fight in the ring with POA
and well she seemed really strong back

518
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:22,480
and well she seemed really strong back
 

519
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,149
and well she seemed really strong back
then I didn't even remember if I won or

520
00:19:24,149 --> 00:19:24,159
then I didn't even remember if I won or
 

521
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:26,190
then I didn't even remember if I won or
not but I just had it in my memory that

522
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:26,200
not but I just had it in my memory that
 

523
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,390
not but I just had it in my memory that
that she must be strong because we

524
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:28,400
that she must be strong because we
 

525
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,710
that she must be strong because we
fought before I don't know I had no idea

526
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:31,720
fought before I don't know I had no idea
 

527
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,310
fought before I don't know I had no idea
if

528
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:33,320
if
 

529
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:37,070
if
um if COI would be strong or

530
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:37,080
um if COI would be strong or
 

531
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,669
um if COI would be strong or
not it's been a long time that was like

532
00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:39,679
not it's been a long time that was like
 

533
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,990
not it's been a long time that was like
3 years ago and then she was like oh

534
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:42,000
3 years ago and then she was like oh
 

535
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,390
3 years ago and then she was like oh
okay well you haven't seen me fight so I

536
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:44,400
okay well you haven't seen me fight so I
 

537
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,270
okay well you haven't seen me fight so I
guess that makes sense but then pora did

538
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:47,280
guess that makes sense but then pora did
 

539
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,630
guess that makes sense but then pora did
win easily that was pretty cool and then

540
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:50,640
win easily that was pretty cool and then
 

541
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,270
win easily that was pretty cool and then
in the end there was another fight that

542
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:52,280
in the end there was another fight that
 

543
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,230
in the end there was another fight that
was like a mystery fight uh Aqua Senpai
