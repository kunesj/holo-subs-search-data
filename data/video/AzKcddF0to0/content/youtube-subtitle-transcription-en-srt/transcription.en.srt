and my anemone turned all like kind of
black looking and bruised and I think

92
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:25,800
black looking and bruised and I think
 

93
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,070
black looking and bruised and I think
it's because the salinity in my tank was

94
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,080
it's because the salinity in my tank was
 

95
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,570
it's because the salinity in my tank was
too high

Perimeter made out of stone barriers
 

3141
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:13,129
Perimeter made out of stone barriers
and on the inside I was thinking about

3142

and on the inside I was thinking about
doing uh one by one

3144
01:27:16,610 --> 01:27:16,620
doing uh one by one
 

3145
01:27:16,620 --> 01:27:19,490

01:28:06,830 --> 01:28:06,840
fragments
 

3181
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:12,350
fragments
to make it out of metal

3182
01:28:12,350 --> 01:28:12,360

 

3183
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:13,669

let me see

3184
01:28:13,669 --> 01:28:13,679
let me see
 

3185
01:28:13,679 --> 01:28:15,709
let me see
I have quite a bit I might be able to

3186
01:28:15,709 --> 01:28:15,719
I have quite a bit I might be able to
 

3187
01:28:15,719 --> 01:28:19,669
I have quite a bit I might be able to
make some of the towers out of metal

3188
01:28:19,669 --> 01:28:19,679

 

3189
01:28:19,679 --> 01:28:21,590

I don't know definitely should be out of

01:28:21,590 --> 01:28:21,600
I don't know definitely should be out of
 

3191
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:22,669
I don't know definitely should be out of
metal I don't know how tall I'm gonna

3192
01:28:22,669 --> 01:28:22,679
metal I don't know how tall I'm gonna
 

3193
01:28:22,679 --> 01:28:24,110
metal I don't know how tall I'm gonna
make them maybe I'll just make one

have enough Stone because I'm gonna use
 

3201
01:28:32,820 --> 01:28:34,610
have enough Stone because I'm gonna use
all this stone for the

3202
01:28:34,610 --> 01:28:34,620
all this stone for the
 

3203
01:28:34,620 --> 01:28:38,090
all this stone for the
barriers because it

3204
01:28:38,090 --> 01:28:38,100
barriers because it
 

3205
01:28:38,100 --> 01:28:39,410
barriers because it
um

3206
01:28:39,410 --> 01:28:39,420
um
 

3207
01:28:39,420 --> 01:28:41,750
um
let's see where are they

3208
01:28:41,750 --> 01:28:41,760
let's see where are they
 

3209
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:44,330
let's see where are they
are these external stone walls because

3210
01:28:44,330 --> 01:28:44,340
are these external stone walls because
 

3211
01:28:44,340 --> 01:28:47,270
are these external stone walls because
they have they cost 1500 each and I got

3212
01:28:47,270 --> 01:28:47,280
they have they cost 1500 each and I got
 

3213
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:49,250
they have they cost 1500 each and I got
18 000 and I want the whole perimeter

3214
01:28:49,250 --> 01:28:49,260
18 000 and I want the whole perimeter
 

3215
01:28:49,260 --> 01:28:51,290
18 000 and I want the whole perimeter
like this area

3216
01:28:51,290 --> 01:28:51,300
like this area
 

3217
01:28:51,300 --> 01:28:53,330
like this area
here

3218
01:28:53,330 --> 01:28:53,340
here
 

3219
01:28:53,340 --> 01:28:55,970
here
this whole Outer Square

3220
01:28:55,970 --> 01:28:55,980
this whole Outer Square
 

3221
01:28:55,980 --> 01:29:00,050
this whole Outer Square
make the center one metal

3222
01:29:00,050 --> 01:29:00,060

 

3223
01:29:00,060 --> 01:29:01,550

should there only be one tall one then

3224
01:29:01,550 --> 01:29:01,560
should there only be one tall one then
 

3225
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:08,629
should there only be one tall one then
it'll just make that one out of metal

3226
01:29:08,629 --> 01:29:08,639

 

3227
01:29:08,639 --> 01:29:10,250

bed's too close together share the same

3228
01:29:10,250 --> 01:29:10,260
bed's too close together share the same
 

3229
01:29:10,260 --> 01:29:16,790
bed's too close together share the same
cooldown oh

3230
01:29:16,790 --> 01:29:16,800

 

3231
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:23,750

try to avoid blind spots

3232
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:23,760

 

3233
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:25,790

wait how many cameras do I have let me

3234
01:29:25,790 --> 01:29:25,800
wait how many cameras do I have let me
 

3235
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:26,930
wait how many cameras do I have let me
check I think I have three because

3236
01:29:26,930 --> 01:29:26,940
check I think I have three because
 

3237
01:29:26,940 --> 01:29:28,550
check I think I have three because
otherwise it's gonna put a camera like

3238
01:29:28,550 --> 01:29:28,560
otherwise it's gonna put a camera like
 

3239
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:30,350
otherwise it's gonna put a camera like
on each side

3240
01:29:30,350 --> 01:29:30,360
on each side
 

3241
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:33,350
on each side
so that I could observe each like

3242
01:29:33,350 --> 01:29:33,360
so that I could observe each like
 

3243
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:38,149
so that I could observe each like
Direction so I have wait

3244
01:29:38,149 --> 01:29:38,159

 

3245
01:29:38,159 --> 01:29:39,709

I might have mounted another one out

3246
01:29:39,709 --> 01:29:39,719
I might have mounted another one out
 

3247
01:29:39,719 --> 01:29:41,450
I might have mounted another one out
here

3248
01:29:41,450 --> 01:29:41,460
here
 

3249
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:43,250
here
I just have this one okay I only have

3250
01:29:43,250 --> 01:29:43,260
I just have this one okay I only have
 

3251
01:29:43,260 --> 01:29:46,729
I just have this one okay I only have
three

3252
01:29:46,729 --> 01:29:46,739

 

3253
01:29:46,739 --> 01:29:48,229

all right let's go

3254
01:29:48,229 --> 01:29:48,239
all right let's go
 

3255
01:29:48,239 --> 01:29:49,910
all right let's go
I don't think I need anything from here

3256
01:29:49,910 --> 01:29:49,920
I don't think I need anything from here
 

3257
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:52,129
I don't think I need anything from here
right now but I can always come back

3258
01:29:52,129 --> 01:29:52,139
right now but I can always come back
 

3259
01:29:52,139 --> 01:29:53,750
right now but I can always come back
so I was thinking of building my base in

3260
01:29:53,750 --> 01:29:53,760
so I was thinking of building my base in
 

3261
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:57,530
so I was thinking of building my base in
a really wide open spot so I can snipe

3262
01:29:57,530 --> 01:29:57,540
a really wide open spot so I can snipe
 

3263
01:29:57,540 --> 01:29:59,930
a really wide open spot so I can snipe
kind of by Miko senpai's face but also

3264
01:29:59,930 --> 01:29:59,940
kind of by Miko senpai's face but also
 

3265
01:29:59,940 --> 01:30:02,209
kind of by Miko senpai's face but also
pretty close to the

3266
01:30:02,209 --> 01:30:02,219
pretty close to the
 

3267
01:30:02,219 --> 01:30:04,370
pretty close to the
uh to where the casino is because I

3268
01:30:04,370 --> 01:30:04,380
uh to where the casino is because I
 

3269
01:30:04,380 --> 01:30:05,750
uh to where the casino is because I
think a lot of people will be at the

3270

launchers at me during the war
 

3299
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:55,490
launchers at me during the war
should be a little further down maybe I

3300
01:30:55,490 --> 01:30:55,500
should be a little further down maybe I
 

3301
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:57,649
should be a little further down maybe I
do want some high ground

3302
01:30:57,649 --> 01:30:57,659
do want some high ground
 

3303
01:30:57,659 --> 01:31:01,189

oh

3304
01:31:01,189 --> 01:31:01,199

 

3305
01:31:01,199 --> 01:31:02,810

building on a hill to get high ground is

3306
01:31:02,810 --> 01:31:02,820
building on a hill to get high ground is
 

3307
01:31:02,820 --> 01:31:04,189
building on a hill to get high ground is
a good idea

3308
01:31:04,189 --> 01:31:04,199
a good idea
 

3309
01:31:04,199 --> 01:31:07,370
a good idea
also someplace where I can overlook

3310
01:31:07,370 --> 01:31:07,380
also someplace where I can overlook
 

3311
01:31:07,380 --> 01:31:10,430
also someplace where I can overlook
the Bandit Camp if this is a good like

3312
01:31:10,430 --> 01:31:10,440
the Bandit Camp if this is a good like
 

3313
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:12,770
the Bandit Camp if this is a good like
this hill right here and access to the

3314
01:31:12,770 --> 01:31:12,780
this hill right here and access to the
 

3315
01:31:12,780 --> 01:31:14,270
this hill right here and access to the
road

3316

and I can see the Bandit Camp from here
maybe this would be good or maybe over

3320
01:31:18,950 --> 01:31:18,960
maybe this would be good or maybe over
 

3321
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:21,110
maybe this would be good or maybe over
there let me go across I think over

3322
01:31:21,110 --> 01:31:21,120
there let me go across I think over
 

3323
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:22,669
there let me go across I think over
there might be better because the exits

3324
01:31:22,669 --> 01:31:22,679
there might be better because the exits
 

3325
01:31:22,679 --> 01:31:24,350
there might be better because the exits
in the casino

3326
01:31:24,350 --> 01:31:24,360

a little leg we are

3334
01:31:36,890 --> 01:31:36,900
a little leg we are
 

3335
01:31:36,900 --> 01:31:45,470
a little leg we are
I think I'll pick this hill

3336
01:31:45,470 --> 01:31:45,480

 

3337
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:46,850

all right it's the entrance to the

3338
01:31:46,850 --> 01:31:46,860
all right it's the entrance to the
 

3339
01:31:46,860 --> 01:31:51,530
all right it's the entrance to the
casino right here

I'm gonna die

3342
01:31:54,590 --> 01:31:54,600

 

3343
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:56,209

3344
01:31:56,209 --> 01:31:56,219
okay
 

3345
01:31:56,219 --> 01:31:59,990
okay
like around

3346
01:31:59,990 --> 01:32:00,000

 

3347
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,850

if I can build here this will be a good

3348
01:32:01,850 --> 01:32:01,860
if I can build here this will be a good
 

3349
01:32:01,860 --> 01:32:03,050
if I can build here this will be a good
spot

3350
01:32:03,050 --> 01:32:03,060
spot
 

3351
01:32:03,060 --> 01:32:05,810
spot
I don't know if I can build this close

3352
01:32:05,810 --> 01:32:05,820
I don't know if I can build this close
 

3353
01:32:05,820 --> 01:32:08,510
I don't know if I can build this close
let me see

3354
01:32:08,510 --> 01:32:08,520

 

3355
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:11,990

apparently I can okay

3356
01:32:11,990 --> 01:32:12,000
apparently I can okay
 

3357
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,270
apparently I can okay
oh I need to build the stone barriers

3358
01:32:14,270 --> 01:32:14,280
oh I need to build the stone barriers
 

3359
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:16,250
oh I need to build the stone barriers
okay for now I'm just gonna build my

3360
01:32:16,250 --> 01:32:16,260
okay for now I'm just gonna build my
 

3361
01:32:16,260 --> 01:32:17,570
okay for now I'm just gonna build my
Foundation

3362
01:32:17,570 --> 01:32:17,580
Foundation
 

3363
01:32:17,580 --> 01:32:20,870
Foundation
so I'll put uh where should the tower be

3364
01:32:20,870 --> 01:32:20,880
so I'll put uh where should the tower be
 

3365
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:23,030
so I'll put uh where should the tower be
somewhere that's not blocked by tree so

3366
01:32:23,030 --> 01:32:23,040
somewhere that's not blocked by tree so
 

3367
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:26,629
somewhere that's not blocked by tree so
my facing the Bandit Camp right now

3368
01:32:26,629 --> 01:32:26,639

 

3369
01:32:26,639 --> 01:32:30,229

that's it

3370
01:32:30,229 --> 01:32:30,239

 

3371
01:32:30,239 --> 01:32:33,410

here but there's a lot of trees

3372
01:32:33,410 --> 01:32:33,420
here but there's a lot of trees
 

3373
01:32:33,420 --> 01:32:41,450
here but there's a lot of trees
maybe it should be on the Stone Hill

3374
01:32:41,450 --> 01:32:41,460

 

3375
01:32:41,460 --> 01:32:42,770

I wonder if I'll be able to see if I

3376
01:32:42,770 --> 01:32:42,780
I wonder if I'll be able to see if I
 

3377
01:32:42,780 --> 01:32:44,090
I wonder if I'll be able to see if I
make it tall enough I should be able to

3378
01:32:44,090 --> 01:32:44,100
make it tall enough I should be able to
 

3379
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:52,129
make it tall enough I should be able to
right

3380
01:32:52,129 --> 01:32:52,139

 

3381
01:32:52,139 --> 01:32:57,530

what is that wait what is that

3382
01:32:57,530 --> 01:32:57,540

 

3383
01:32:57,540 --> 01:33:09,050

what was that

3384
01:33:09,050 --> 01:33:09,060

 

3385
01:33:09,060 --> 01:33:10,490

he goes Empire

3386
01:33:10,490 --> 01:33:10,500
he goes Empire
 

3387
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:12,050
he goes Empire
Maybe

3388
01:33:12,050 --> 01:33:12,060
Maybe
 

3389
01:33:12,060 --> 01:33:13,550
Maybe
all right through this opening I'm gonna

3390
01:33:13,550 --> 01:33:13,560
all right through this opening I'm gonna
 

3391
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:14,810
all right through this opening I'm gonna
try to get through the opening because

3392
01:33:14,810 --> 01:33:14,820
try to get through the opening because
 

3393
01:33:14,820 --> 01:33:18,350
try to get through the opening because
look I'm staring almost straight at it

3394
01:33:18,350 --> 01:33:18,360
look I'm staring almost straight at it
 

3395
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:23,030
look I'm staring almost straight at it
like right there

3396
01:33:23,030 --> 01:33:23,040

 

3397
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:25,010

if not I'll just go and cut down some of

3398
01:33:25,010 --> 01:33:25,020
if not I'll just go and cut down some of
 

3399
01:33:25,020 --> 01:33:29,390
if not I'll just go and cut down some of
those tall trees

3400
01:33:29,390 --> 01:33:29,400

 

3401
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:34,790

I think it should be tall enough

3402
01:33:34,790 --> 01:33:34,800

 

3403
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:37,669

I'm gonna build a little

3404
01:33:37,669 --> 01:33:37,679
I'm gonna build a little
 

3405
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:41,030
I'm gonna build a little
base area around here

3406
01:33:41,030 --> 01:33:41,040

 

3407
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:43,250

now oh but there's this rock back here

3408
01:33:43,250 --> 01:33:43,260
now oh but there's this rock back here
 

3409
01:33:43,260 --> 01:33:45,530
now oh but there's this rock back here
to get all in case that in the stone

3410
01:33:45,530 --> 01:33:45,540
to get all in case that in the stone
 

3411
01:33:45,540 --> 01:33:51,950
to get all in case that in the stone
barriers too maybe

3412
01:33:51,950 --> 01:33:51,960

 

3413
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:53,689

okay so this will be where my tower is

3414
01:33:53,689 --> 01:33:53,699
okay so this will be where my tower is
 

3415
01:33:53,699 --> 01:33:56,209
okay so this will be where my tower is
and I'll put spiral stairs

3416
01:33:56,209 --> 01:33:56,219
and I'll put spiral stairs
 

3417
01:33:56,219 --> 01:33:59,390
and I'll put spiral stairs
for now I guess I'll upgrade hopefully

3418
01:33:59,390 --> 01:33:59,400
for now I guess I'll upgrade hopefully
 

3419
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:00,950
for now I guess I'll upgrade hopefully
if I make the foundation stone it should

3420
01:34:00,950 --> 01:34:00,960
if I make the foundation stone it should
 

3421
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:02,149
if I make the foundation stone it should
be good enough and then I'll have the

3422
01:34:02,149 --> 01:34:02,159
be good enough and then I'll have the
 

3423
01:34:02,159 --> 01:34:04,370
be good enough and then I'll have the
walls surrounding

3424
01:34:04,370 --> 01:34:04,380
walls surrounding

3996
01:51:13,370 --> 01:51:13,380
one more stone wall try to build
 

3997
01:51:13,380 --> 01:51:24,530
one more stone wall try to build
finish to complete the wall

3998
01:51:24,530 --> 01:51:24,540

 

3999
01:51:24,540 --> 01:51:26,750

I think I have to research them first

4008
01:51:44,990 --> 01:51:45,000
I think I have to research them first
 

4009
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,089
I think I have to research them first
but I'm not that far off from uh getting

4010
01:51:47,089 --> 01:51:47,099
but I'm not that far off from uh getting
 

4011
01:51:47,099 --> 01:51:48,890
but I'm not that far off from uh getting
them so I'll have enough scrap to get it

4012
01:51:48,890 --> 01:51:48,900
them so I'll have enough scrap to get it
 

4013
01:51:48,900 --> 01:51:50,390
them so I'll have enough scrap to get it
I'll probably do that right now not

4014
01:51:50,390 --> 01:51:50,400
I'll probably do that right now not
 

4015
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:56,510
I'll probably do that right now not
research it but uh

find it in the tech tree all right I
 

4019
01:51:58,679 --> 01:52:00,290
find it in the tech tree all right I
need to build let's bring all my metal

4020
01:52:00,290 --> 01:52:00,300
need to build let's bring all my metal
 

4021

5771
02:45:23,340 --> 02:45:25,670

now with these I'll go get her down I'll

5772
02:45:25,670 --> 02:45:25,680
now with these I'll go get her down I'll
 

5773
02:45:25,680 --> 02:45:33,349
now with these I'll go get her down I'll
just make it wood

5774
02:45:33,349 --> 02:45:33,359

 

5775
02:45:33,359 --> 02:45:35,990

all right

5776

5777
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:43,610

I'm gonna empty out all this wood

5778
02:45:43,610 --> 02:45:43,620

 

5779
02:45:43,620 --> 02:45:48,230

expensive okay we're still at 13 hours

5780
02:45:48,230 --> 02:45:48,240

 

5781
02:45:48,240 --> 02:45:49,429

the only thing that's keeping me at 13

5782
02:45:49,429 --> 02:45:49,439
the only thing that's keeping me at 13
 

5783
02:45:49,439 --> 02:45:52,190
the only thing that's keeping me at 13
hours I think is uh either this

5784
02:45:52,190 --> 02:45:52,200
hours I think is uh either this
 

5785
02:45:52,200 --> 02:45:54,710
hours I think is uh either this

5839
02:47:21,120 --> 02:47:23,269

I know which tree it is

5840
02:47:23,269 --> 02:47:23,279
I know which tree it is
 

5841
02:47:23,279 --> 02:47:33,190
I know which tree it is
still

5842
02:47:33,190 --> 02:47:33,200

 

5843
02:47:33,200 --> 02:47:36,349

uh let me see
 

5845
02:47:36,359 --> 02:47:37,670
uh let me see
actually I don't think I can cut it down

5846
02:47:37,670 --> 02:47:37,680
actually I don't think I can cut it down
 

5847
02:47:37,680 --> 02:47:39,349
actually I don't think I can cut it down
because I think it's too close to the

5848
02:47:39,349 --> 02:47:39,359
because I think it's too close to the
 

5849
02:47:39,359 --> 02:47:40,670
because I think it's too close to the
their base

5850
02:47:40,670 --> 02:47:40,680
their base
 

5851
02:47:40,680 --> 02:47:42,530
their base
this tree

5852
02:47:42,530 --> 02:47:42,540
this tree
 

5853
02:47:42,540 --> 02:47:53,150
this tree
I'm risking it

5854
02:47:53,150 --> 02:47:53,160

 

5855
02:47:53,160 --> 02:47:54,889

5859
02:48:06,300 --> 02:48:07,610

I really want to break that tree maybe

5860
02:48:07,610 --> 02:48:07,620
I really want to break that tree maybe
 

5861
02:48:07,620 --> 02:48:13,550
I really want to break that tree maybe
if I Ram it with my car enough

5862
02:48:13,550 --> 02:48:13,560

 

5863
02:48:13,560 --> 02:48:15,469

yeah there was a white tree that was in

damn it it's that tree
maybe I'll just run in

5874
02:48:38,210 --> 02:48:38,220
maybe I'll just run in
 

5875
02:48:38,220 --> 02:48:39,769
maybe I'll just run in
I'll stay inside the Zone stay outside

5876
