yes but you find it's really easy to
 

893
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,430
yes but you find it's really easy to
find the stuff to build

894
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:03,440
find the stuff to build
 

895
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,230

899
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,950
then
maybe we should also turn off key cards

900
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:08,960
maybe we should also turn off key cards
 

901
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,470
maybe we should also turn off key cards
so we can go straight to the keys ah

902
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:12,480
so we can go straight to the keys ah
 

903
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,510
so we can go straight to the keys ah
that's also smart yeah yeah we'll see

904
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:15,520
that's also smart yeah yeah we'll see
 

905
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,870
that's also smart yeah yeah we'll see
how it goes
