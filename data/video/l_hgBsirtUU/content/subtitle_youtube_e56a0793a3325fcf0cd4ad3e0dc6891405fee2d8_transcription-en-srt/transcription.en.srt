5991
02:42:27,720 --> 02:42:31,550
7 okay the width should be
okay uh although over on here this side

5992
02:42:31,550 --> 02:42:31,560
okay uh although over on here this side
 

5993
02:42:31,560 --> 02:42:32,790
okay uh although over on here this side
might be

5994
02:42:32,790 --> 02:42:32,800
might be
 

5995
02:42:32,800 --> 02:42:36,429
might be
too but it's okay then I'll put it

5996
02:42:36,429 --> 02:42:36,439
too but it's okay then I'll put it
 

5997
02:42:36,439 --> 02:42:39,870
too but it's okay then I'll put it
like one two three four yeah it should

5998
02:42:39,870 --> 02:42:39,880
like one two three four yeah it should
 

5999
02:42:39,880 --> 02:42:43,510
like one two three four yeah it should
be fine if I just put it here

6000
02:42:43,510 --> 02:42:43,520
be fine if I just put it here
 

6001
02:42:43,520 --> 02:42:46,550
be fine if I just put it here
whatever and then I'm going to make

6002
02:42:46,550 --> 02:42:46,560
whatever and then I'm going to make
 

6003
02:42:46,560 --> 02:42:50,110
whatever and then I'm going to make
these fields a little bit longer

6004
02:42:50,110 --> 02:42:50,120
these fields a little bit longer
 

6005
02:42:50,120 --> 02:42:52,349
these fields a little bit longer
I know like

6006
02:42:52,349 --> 02:42:52,359
I know like
 

6007
02:42:52,359 --> 02:42:56,269
I know like
this so that the Scarecrow is in the

6008
02:42:56,269 --> 02:42:56,279
this so that the Scarecrow is in the
 

6009
02:42:56,279 --> 02:42:58,510
this so that the Scarecrow is in the
middle and then I'm going to make this a

6010
02:42:58,510 --> 02:42:58,520
middle and then I'm going to make this a
 

6011
02:42:58,520 --> 02:43:00,309
middle and then I'm going to make this a
little bit shorter so that the length

6012
02:43:00,309 --> 02:43:00,319
little bit shorter so that the length
 

6013
02:43:00,319 --> 02:43:03,150
little bit shorter so that the length
looks is actually is it right side

6014
02:43:03,150 --> 02:43:03,160
looks is actually is it right side
 

6015
02:43:03,160 --> 02:43:07,670
looks is actually is it right side
longer like this yay this should

6016
02:43:07,670 --> 02:43:07,680
longer like this yay this should
 

6017
02:43:07,680 --> 02:43:13,510
longer like this yay this should
be the proper way

6018
02:43:13,510 --> 02:43:13,520

 

6019
02:43:13,520 --> 02:43:16,429

oopsie right looks looks about right

6020
02:43:16,429 --> 02:43:16,439
oopsie right looks looks about right
 

6021
02:43:16,439 --> 02:43:19,780
oopsie right looks looks about right
looks perfect

6022
02:43:19,780 --> 02:43:19,790

05:17:36,958 --> 05:17:39,990
problem in that
case because

11760
05:17:39,990 --> 05:17:40,000
case because
 

11761
05:17:40,000 --> 05:17:43,230
case because
I think when like the building is really

11762
05:17:43,230 --> 05:17:43,240
I think when like the building is really
 

11763
05:17:43,240 --> 05:17:46,350
I think when like the building is really
modern and wellb

11764
05:17:46,350 --> 05:17:46,360

then they don't get through as easily as
 

11769
05:17:51,680 --> 05:17:54,548
then they don't get through as easily as
in older buildings right cuz I think

11770
05:17:54,548 --> 05:17:54,558
in older buildings right cuz I think
 

11771
05:17:54,558 --> 05:17:56,910
in older buildings right cuz I think
back then it was like an older more

11772
