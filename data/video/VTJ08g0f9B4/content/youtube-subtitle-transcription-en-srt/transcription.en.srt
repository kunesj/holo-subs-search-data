13483
06:45:11,680 --> 06:45:14,868
dragon at least so that was my my ticket
to starting first so I rolled first and

13484
06:45:14,868 --> 06:45:14,878
to starting first so I rolled first and
 

13485
06:45:14,878 --> 06:45:17,510
to starting first so I rolled first and
you know that is a big Advantage if you

13486
06:45:17,510 --> 06:45:17,520
you know that is a big Advantage if you
 

13487
06:45:17,520 --> 06:45:20,030
you know that is a big Advantage if you
get to go first in Monopoly or even

13488
06:45:20,030 --> 06:45:20,040
get to go first in Monopoly or even
 

13489
06:45:20,040 --> 06:45:21,510
get to go first in Monopoly or even
second

13490
06:45:21,510 --> 06:45:21,520
second
 

13491
06:45:21,520 --> 06:45:23,830
second
but yeah if you go third or four if

13492
06:45:23,830 --> 06:45:23,840
but yeah if you go third or four if
 

13493
06:45:23,840 --> 06:45:26,310
but yeah if you go third or four if
you're a little bit so it started

13494
06:45:26,310 --> 06:45:26,320
you're a little bit so it started
 

13495
06:45:26,320 --> 06:45:29,788
you're a little bit so it started
off great I was like ahead of people but

13496
06:45:29,788 --> 06:45:29,798
off great I was like ahead of people but
 

13497
06:45:29,798 --> 06:45:31,468
off great I was like ahead of people but
somehow you

13498
06:45:31,468 --> 06:45:31,478
somehow you
 

13499
06:45:31,478 --> 06:45:34,430
somehow you
know I think in every Monopoly game the

13500
06:45:34,430 --> 06:45:34,440
know I think in every Monopoly game the
 

13501
06:45:34,440 --> 06:45:36,388
know I think in every Monopoly game the
order of the properties is kind of the

13502
06:45:36,388 --> 06:45:36,398
order of the properties is kind of the
 

13503
06:45:36,398 --> 06:45:38,030
order of the properties is kind of the
same like you start off with the the

13504
06:45:38,030 --> 06:45:38,040
same like you start off with the the
 

13505
06:45:38,040 --> 06:45:40,230
same like you start off with the the
first fields are the brown ones then is

13506
06:45:40,230 --> 06:45:40,240
first fields are the brown ones then is
 

13507
06:45:40,240 --> 06:45:43,590
first fields are the brown ones then is
um yellow H not yellow light blue and

13508
06:45:43,590 --> 06:45:43,600
um yellow H not yellow light blue and
 

13509
06:45:43,600 --> 06:45:47,750
um yellow H not yellow light blue and
then another color I think pink and then

13510
06:45:47,750 --> 06:45:47,760
then another color I think pink and then
 

13511
06:45:47,760 --> 06:45:51,150
then another color I think pink and then
it was uh orange and then you go around

13512
06:45:51,150 --> 06:45:51,160
it was uh orange and then you go around
 

13513
06:45:51,160 --> 06:45:53,110
it was uh orange and then you go around
that the second corner and that's where

13514
06:45:53,110 --> 06:45:53,120
that the second corner and that's where
 

13515
06:45:53,120 --> 06:45:56,868
that the second corner and that's where
Red is and until red for some reason I

13516
06:45:56,868 --> 06:45:56,878
Red is and until red for some reason I
 

13517
06:45:56,878 --> 06:45:58,868
Red is and until red for some reason I
didn't land on

13518
06:45:58,868 --> 06:45:58,878
didn't land on
 

13519
06:45:58,878 --> 06:46:03,910
didn't land on
anything what I could

13520
06:46:03,910 --> 06:46:03,920

 

13521
06:46:03,920 --> 06:46:08,548

buy it was messed up even though I went

13522
06:46:08,548 --> 06:46:08,558
buy it was messed up even though I went
 

13523
06:46:08,558 --> 06:46:10,788
buy it was messed up even though I went
first and then I went on red and I

13524
06:46:10,788 --> 06:46:10,798
first and then I went on red and I
 

13525
06:46:10,798 --> 06:46:12,430
first and then I went on red and I
bought the red of course I think I

13526
06:46:12,430 --> 06:46:12,440
bought the red of course I think I
 

13527
06:46:12,440 --> 06:46:14,230
bought the red of course I think I
landed on a on a religion maybe that I

13528
06:46:14,230 --> 06:46:14,240
landed on a on a religion maybe that I
 

13529
06:46:14,240 --> 06:46:16,990
landed on a on a religion maybe that I
also bought before I got the

13530
06:46:16,990 --> 06:46:17,000
also bought before I got the
 

13531
06:46:17,000 --> 06:46:19,990
also bought before I got the
red so then I landed on red but then

13532
06:46:19,990 --> 06:46:20,000
red so then I landed on red but then
 

13533
06:46:20,000 --> 06:46:24,350
red so then I landed on red but then
like after that I also kind of like I

13534
06:46:24,350 --> 06:46:24,360
like after that I also kind of like I
 

13535
06:46:24,360 --> 06:46:26,788
like after that I also kind of like I
think I had some other

13536
06:46:26,788 --> 06:46:26,798
think I had some other
 

13537
06:46:26,798 --> 06:46:29,510
think I had some other
unlucky things happen where I just

13538
06:46:29,510 --> 06:46:29,520
unlucky things happen where I just
 

13539
06:46:29,520 --> 06:46:31,548
unlucky things happen where I just
either didn't land on buildings or I

13540
06:46:31,548 --> 06:46:31,558
either didn't land on buildings or I
 

13541
06:46:31,558 --> 06:46:32,868
either didn't land on buildings or I
landed on the ones that were already

13542
06:46:32,868 --> 06:46:32,878
landed on the ones that were already
 

13543
06:46:32,878 --> 06:46:34,628
landed on the ones that were already
taken cuz people already were ahead of

13544
06:46:34,628 --> 06:46:34,638
taken cuz people already were ahead of
 

13545
06:46:34,638 --> 06:46:37,910
taken cuz people already were ahead of
me at that point or I went to the jail

13546
06:46:37,910 --> 06:46:37,920
me at that point or I went to the jail
 

13547
06:46:37,920 --> 06:46:41,708
me at that point or I went to the jail
and so on I got monopo really early on

13548
06:46:41,708 --> 06:46:41,718
and so on I got monopo really early on
 

13549
06:46:41,718 --> 06:46:45,628
and so on I got monopo really early on
yeah um but I did get one cool card that

13550
06:46:45,628 --> 06:46:45,638
yeah um but I did get one cool card that
 

13551
06:46:45,638 --> 06:46:49,190
yeah um but I did get one cool card that
let me eventually take or like trade I

13552
06:46:49,190 --> 06:46:49,200
let me eventually take or like trade I
 

13553
06:46:49,200 --> 06:46:51,110
let me eventually take or like trade I
did I think I did get one of the light

13554
06:46:51,110 --> 06:46:51,120
did I think I did get one of the light

13559
06:46:54,878 --> 06:46:56,270
ones um and the red one red one So
eventually I traded one of the light

13560
06:46:56,270 --> 06:46:56,280
eventually I traded one of the light
 

13561
06:46:56,280 --> 06:46:58,030
eventually I traded one of the light
blue ones with someone else's red one

13562
06:46:58,030 --> 06:46:58,040
blue ones with someone else's red one
 

13563

and got my second red and eventually I

13564
06:46:59,868 --> 06:46:59,878
and got my second red and eventually I
 

13565
06:46:59,878 --> 06:47:02,548
and got my second red and eventually I
was able to complete my red collection

13566
06:47:02,548 --> 06:47:02,558
was able to complete my red collection
 

13567
06:47:02,558 --> 06:47:04,830
was able to complete my red collection
but by the time that I had my red

13568
06:47:04,830 --> 06:47:04,840
but by the time that I had my red
 

13569
06:47:04,840 --> 06:47:06,310
but by the time that I had my red
collection which was pretty good cuz I

13570
06:47:06,310 --> 06:47:06,320
collection which was pretty good cuz I
 

13571
06:47:06,320 --> 06:47:08,388
collection which was pretty good cuz I
think I was either the first or the

13572
06:47:08,388 --> 06:47:08,398
think I was either the first or the
 

13573
06:47:08,398 --> 06:47:10,150
think I was either the first or the
second one with with a full collection

13574
06:47:10,150 --> 06:47:10,160
second one with with a full collection
 

13575
06:47:10,160 --> 06:47:12,070
second one with with a full collection
cuz then you can start building houses

13576
06:47:12,070 --> 06:47:12,080
cuz then you can start building houses
 

13577
06:47:12,080 --> 06:47:14,670
cuz then you can start building houses
which are Towers in this case but by

13578
06:47:14,670 --> 06:47:14,680
which are Towers in this case but by
 

13579
06:47:14,680 --> 06:47:17,910
which are Towers in this case but by
that time I think everybody else had

13580
06:47:17,910 --> 06:47:17,920
that time I think everybody else had
 

13581
06:47:17,920 --> 06:47:20,750
that time I think everybody else had
maybe not a full collection but a lot of

13582
06:47:20,750 --> 06:47:20,760
maybe not a full collection but a lot of
 

13583
06:47:20,760 --> 06:47:22,788
maybe not a full collection but a lot of
different other colors and all I had was

13584
06:47:22,788 --> 06:47:22,798
different other colors and all I had was
 

13585
06:47:22,798 --> 06:47:27,070
different other colors and all I had was
one Rel religion and a full red

13586
06:47:27,070 --> 06:47:27,080
one Rel religion and a full red
 

13587
06:47:27,080 --> 06:47:29,430
one Rel religion and a full red
collection and the religions were really

13588
06:47:29,430 --> 06:47:29,440
collection and the religions were really
 

13589
06:47:29,440 --> 06:47:31,430
collection and the religions were really
really cheap like you land on a religion

13590
06:47:31,430 --> 06:47:31,440
really cheap like you land on a religion
 

13591
06:47:31,440 --> 06:47:33,190
really cheap like you land on a religion
if you have one religion you only pay

13592
06:47:33,190 --> 06:47:33,200
if you have one religion you only pay
 

13593
06:47:33,200 --> 06:47:36,430
if you have one religion you only pay
one coin to the religion owner if you

13594
06:47:36,430 --> 06:47:36,440
one coin to the religion owner if you
 

13595
06:47:36,440 --> 06:47:38,230
one coin to the religion owner if you
have two religions there's four in total

13596
06:47:38,230 --> 06:47:38,240
have two religions there's four in total
 

13597
06:47:38,240 --> 06:47:39,868
have two religions there's four in total
it gets more and more but even at the

13598
06:47:39,868 --> 06:47:39,878
it gets more and more but even at the
 

13599
06:47:39,878 --> 06:47:41,910
it gets more and more but even at the
most it really isn't worth it and

13600
06:47:41,910 --> 06:47:41,920
most it really isn't worth it and
 

13601
06:47:41,920 --> 06:47:44,350
most it really isn't worth it and
somehow nobody was ever landing on the

13602
06:47:44,350 --> 06:47:44,360
somehow nobody was ever landing on the
 

13603
06:47:44,360 --> 06:47:47,030
somehow nobody was ever landing on the
religions anyway so it's pretty pretty

13604
06:47:47,030 --> 06:47:47,040
religions anyway so it's pretty pretty
 

13605
06:47:47,040 --> 06:47:48,548
religions anyway so it's pretty pretty
useless yeah I think the blue one was a

13606
06:47:48,548 --> 06:47:48,558
useless yeah I think the blue one was a
 

13607
06:47:48,558 --> 06:47:50,310
useless yeah I think the blue one was a
good trade because I knew I thought

13608
06:47:50,310 --> 06:47:50,320
good trade because I knew I thought
 

13609
06:47:50,320 --> 06:47:54,430
good trade because I knew I thought
really hard about it cuz that person uh

13610
06:47:54,430 --> 06:47:54,440
really hard about it cuz that person uh
 

13611
06:47:54,440 --> 06:47:56,830
really hard about it cuz that person uh
would have had to first get the last

13612
06:47:56,830 --> 06:47:56,840
would have had to first get the last
 

13613
06:47:56,840 --> 06:47:59,030
would have had to first get the last
blue the last light blue also from

13614
06:47:59,030 --> 06:47:59,040
blue the last light blue also from
 

13615
06:47:59,040 --> 06:48:01,750
blue the last light blue also from
another person so they were like

13616
06:48:01,750 --> 06:48:01,760
another person so they were like
 

13617
06:48:01,760 --> 06:48:03,270
another person so they were like
scattered they would have to make an

13618
06:48:03,270 --> 06:48:03,280
scattered they would have to make an
 

13619
06:48:03,280 --> 06:48:05,548
scattered they would have to make an
effort first to get even more light blue

13620
06:48:05,548 --> 06:48:05,558
effort first to get even more light blue
 

13621
06:48:05,558 --> 06:48:07,590
effort first to get even more light blue
like I wasn't like completing their Blue

13622
06:48:07,590 --> 06:48:07,600
like I wasn't like completing their Blue
 

13623
06:48:07,600 --> 06:48:08,788
like I wasn't like completing their Blue
collection

13624
06:48:08,788 --> 06:48:08,798
collection
 

13625
06:48:08,798 --> 06:48:12,310
collection
basically yeah so that went on for a

13626
06:48:12,310 --> 06:48:12,320
basically yeah so that went on for a
 

13627
06:48:12,320 --> 06:48:14,310
basically yeah so that went on for a
while like I started building really

13628
06:48:14,310 --> 06:48:14,320
