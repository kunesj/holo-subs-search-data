00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,190
dead roots and all that uh they were
like tangled with the others and

178
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:17,200
like tangled with the others and
 

179
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,630
like tangled with the others and
um

180
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:18,640
um
 

181
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,670
um
you know

182
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:19,680
you know
 

183
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,590
you know
i feel like generally with a plant from

184
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:21,600
i feel like generally with a plant from
 

185
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,870
i feel like generally with a plant from
what i've seen

186
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:22,880
what i've seen
 

187
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,829
what i've seen
uh

188
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:23,839
uh
 

189
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,829
uh
it starts

190
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:25,839
it starts
 

191
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,509
it starts
dying from

192
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:27,519
dying from
 

193
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,190
dying from
from the from the

194
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:29,200
from the from the
 

195
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,790
from the from the
from the bottom

196
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:30,800
from the bottom
 

197
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,829
from the bottom
from like the end of the of the leaf but

198
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:33,839
from like the end of the of the leaf but
 

199
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,470
from like the end of the of the leaf but
in in my plant's case probably because

200
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:36,480
in in my plant's case probably because
 

201
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,710
in in my plant's case probably because
it was drowning in water it was the

202
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:38,720
it was drowning in water it was the
 

203
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,110
it was drowning in water it was the
other way around like the end of a long

204
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:43,120
other way around like the end of a long
 

205
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,630
other way around like the end of a long
long long thingy like it's like it's a

206
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:46,640
long long thingy like it's like it's a
 

207
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,870
long long thingy like it's like it's a
plant that's like like one string and

208
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:48,880
plant that's like like one string and
 

209
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,509
plant that's like like one string and
then lots of tiny leaves on it right

210
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:51,519
then lots of tiny leaves on it right
 

211
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,190
then lots of tiny leaves on it right
so half of it the end of it

212
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:55,200
so half of it the end of it
 

213
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,870
so half of it the end of it
uh was happy and beautiful but the other

214
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:58,880
uh was happy and beautiful but the other
 

215
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,710
uh was happy and beautiful but the other
the the beginning of it you know that

216
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:00,720
the the beginning of it you know that
 

217
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,990
the the beginning of it you know that
comes out of the soil um a lot of those

218
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:04,000
comes out of the soil um a lot of those
 

219
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,069
comes out of the soil um a lot of those
where uh dead and brown and dry

220
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:08,079
where uh dead and brown and dry
 

221
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,870
where uh dead and brown and dry
but but i i'm a plant beginner okay and

222
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:10,880
but but i i'm a plant beginner okay and
 

223
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,509
but but i i'm a plant beginner okay and
i think logically like if there if the

224
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:13,519
i think logically like if there if the
 

225
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,550
i think logically like if there if the
plant looks dry shouldn't i add more

226
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:16,560
plant looks dry shouldn't i add more
 

227
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,470
plant looks dry shouldn't i add more
water and this is where my mom's gonna

228
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:18,480
water and this is where my mom's gonna
 

229
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,310
water and this is where my mom's gonna
dm me immediately although she doesn't

dm me immediately although she doesn't
watch my yakuza stream so maybe she's

232
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:22,000
watch my yakuza stream so maybe she's
 

233
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,629
watch my yakuza stream so maybe she's
not watching right now but she's gonna

234
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:24,639
not watching right now but she's gonna
 

235
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,430
not watching right now but she's gonna
be like yeah you're so stupid no

um that is gonna be okay but i have
another plant where i also have a

282
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:18,480
another plant where i also have a
 

283
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,870
another plant where i also have a
problem like this is a small plant okay

284
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:20,880
problem like this is a small plant okay
 

285
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,110
problem like this is a small plant okay
just a small like little pot with some

286
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:23,120
just a small like little pot with some
 

287
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,110
just a small like little pot with some
small plants okay and um small leaves um

288
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:27,120
small plants okay and um small leaves um
 

289
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,110
small plants okay and um small leaves um
but like it covers the whole soil so you

290
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:29,120
but like it covers the whole soil so you
 

291
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,949
but like it covers the whole soil so you
don't see the soil

292
00:13:30,949 --> 00:13:30,959
don't see the soil
 

293
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,590
don't see the soil
and um

294
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:33,600

 

295
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,190

i

296
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:35,200
i
 

297
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,670
i
i [\h__\h] that up that plant also really

298
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:37,680
i [\h__\h] that up that plant also really
 

299
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,150
i [\h__\h] that up that plant also really
fast there is only one plant in my

300
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:40,160
fast there is only one plant in my
 

301
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,470
fast there is only one plant in my
apartment that no matter what i do i

302
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:42,480
apartment that no matter what i do i
 

303
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,629
apartment that no matter what i do i
cannot [\h__\h] it up but this little small

304
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:44,639
cannot [\h__\h] it up but this little small
 

305
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,550
cannot [\h__\h] it up but this little small
plant i seem to have [\h__\h] up as well

306
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:46,560
plant i seem to have [\h__\h] up as well
 

307
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,269
plant i seem to have [\h__\h] up as well
because

308
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:49,279
because
 

309
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,350
because
going by my logic of

310
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:51,360
going by my logic of
 

311
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,990
going by my logic of
you know the plant seems dry how about i

312
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:54,000
you know the plant seems dry how about i
 

313
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,550
you know the plant seems dry how about i
put some water into it it doesn't seem

314
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:56,560
put some water into it it doesn't seem
 

315
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,670
put some water into it it doesn't seem
to have worked like the the leaves

316
00:13:59,670 --> 00:13:59,680
to have worked like the the leaves
 

317
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,389
to have worked like the the leaves
they're not no brown leaves but all of

318
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:02,399
they're not no brown leaves but all of
 

319
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,870
they're not no brown leaves but all of
the leaves are dry as [\h__\h]

320
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:04,880
the leaves are dry as [\h__\h]
 

321
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,670
the leaves are dry as [\h__\h]
like

322
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:05,680
like
 

323
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,990
like
it's like completely dried out

324
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:08,000
it's like completely dried out
 

325
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,310
it's like completely dried out
and the soil

326
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:10,320
and the soil
 

327
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,310
and the soil
is kind of molding a little bit

328
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:14,320
is kind of molding a little bit
 

329
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,870
is kind of molding a little bit
and now we got a new plant the other day

330
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:16,880
and now we got a new plant the other day
 

331
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,110
and now we got a new plant the other day
and it's also molding the soil is also

332
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:19,120
and it's also molding the soil is also
 

333
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,389
and it's also molding the soil is also
building

334
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:20,399
building
 

335
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,310
building
that probably means i

336
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:22,320
that probably means i
 

337
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,790
that probably means i
i am watering them too much i don't even

338
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:24,800
i am watering them too much i don't even
 

339
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,110
i am watering them too much i don't even
water them that much

340
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:27,120
water them that much
 

341
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,269
water them that much
ah

342
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:29,279
ah
 

343
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,189
ah

my guess is
that the moment

04:53:16,390 --> 04:53:16,400
that the moment
 

7497
04:53:16,400 --> 04:53:17,910
that the moment
where

where
 

7499
04:53:17,920 --> 04:53:19,670
where
she was holding

04:53:19,670 --> 04:53:19,680
she was holding
 

7501
04:53:19,680 --> 04:53:21,910
she was holding
her brother

7502
04:53:21,910 --> 04:53:21,920

7503
04:53:21,920 --> 04:53:23,350

and we're not gonna look at the reaction

7504
04:53:23,350 --> 04:53:23,360

7505
04:53:23,360 --> 04:53:25,910
and we're not gonna look at the reaction
from the chat but my guess is that she

7506
04:53:25,910 --> 04:53:25,920
from the chat but my guess is that she
 

7507
04:53:25,920 --> 04:53:28,708
from the chat but my guess is that she
regained her sight at that moment

regained her sight at that moment
 

7509
04:53:28,718 --> 04:53:31,830
regained her sight at that moment
because her consciousness wanted to see

04:53:31,830 --> 04:53:31,840
because her consciousness wanted to see
 

7511
04:53:31,840 --> 04:53:34,470
because her consciousness wanted to see
her brother one last time

04:53:34,470 --> 04:53:34,480
her brother one last time
 

7513
04:53:34,480 --> 04:53:37,830
her brother one last time
and then uh she didn't tell them though

7514
04:53:37,830 --> 04:53:37,840
and then uh she didn't tell them though
 

7515
04:53:37,840 --> 04:53:39,510
and then uh she didn't tell them though
and then ran away

and then ran away
 

7517
04:53:39,520 --> 04:53:41,510
and then ran away
because now that she's not blind she can

7518
04:53:41,510 --> 04:53:41,520
because now that she's not blind she can

05:59:31,750 --> 05:59:31,760
probably
 

9889
05:59:31,760 --> 05:59:33,510
probably
that's probably

9890
05:59:33,510 --> 05:59:33,520
that's probably
 

9891
05:59:33,520 --> 05:59:36,628
that's probably
probably the issue

9892
05:59:36,628 --> 05:59:36,638
probably the issue
 

9893
05:59:36,638 --> 05:59:37,510
probably the issue
but

9894
05:59:37,510 --> 05:59:37,520

tries to
 

9903
05:59:43,520 --> 05:59:45,990
tries to
make you think that mathematics and

9904
05:59:45,990 --> 05:59:46,000
make you think that mathematics and
 

9905
05:59:46,000 --> 05:59:48,070
make you think that mathematics and
oneplus 3 and all that is the important

9906
05:59:48,070 --> 05:59:48,080
oneplus 3 and all that is the important
 

9907

you know a lot of what they teach us we
 

9911
05:59:53,040 --> 05:59:54,948
you know a lot of what they teach us we
never use again

9912

never use again
 

9913
05:59:54,958 --> 05:59:59,270
never use again
later but what we create here in in

05:59:59,270 --> 05:59:59,280
later but what we create here in in
 

9915
05:59:59,280 --> 06:00:00,948
later but what we create here in in
this stream

9916
06:00:00,948 --> 06:00:00,958
this stream
 

9917

06:00:05,670 --> 06:00:05,680
is memories that are temporary you know
 

9923
06:00:05,680 --> 06:00:08,788
is memories that are temporary you know
what mathematics is not temporary it's

9924
06:00:08,788 --> 06:00:08,798
what mathematics is not temporary it's
 

9925
06:00:08,798 --> 06:00:11,350
what mathematics is not temporary it's
forever and even though it is eternal we

9926
06:00:11,350 --> 06:00:11,360
forever and even though it is eternal we
 

9927
06:00:11,360 --> 06:00:14,708
forever and even though it is eternal we
don't need it

9928
06:00:14,708 --> 06:00:14,718

 

9929
06:00:14,718 --> 06:00:16,868

but this here what we need this is what
