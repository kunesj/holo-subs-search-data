I don't think they ever played it on

228
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:11,519
I don't think they ever played it on
 

229
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,230
I don't think they ever played it on
stream but I wonder if they prepared

230
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:13,240
stream but I wonder if they prepared
 

231
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,990
stream but I wonder if they prepared
behind the scenes on how good they are

232
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:16,000
behind the scenes on how good they are
 

233
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,389
behind the scenes on how good they are
uh I certainly streamed it a few times

234
00:12:19,389 --> 00:12:19,399
uh I certainly streamed it a few times
 

235
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:23,389
uh I certainly streamed it a few times
but IDE hardcore that's not

236
00:12:23,389 --> 00:12:23,399
but IDE hardcore that's not
 

237
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:28,110
but IDE hardcore that's not
fair that's not fair MO is a bro o o

238
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:28,120
fair that's not fair MO is a bro o o
 

239
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,230
fair that's not fair MO is a bro o o
yeah I wonder how how can you even what

240
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:30,240
yeah I wonder how how can you even what
 

241
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,590
yeah I wonder how how can you even what
are the options for playing against each

242
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:32,600
are the options for playing against each
 

243
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,550
are the options for playing against each
other can you have a three versus three

244
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:34,560
other can you have a three versus three
 

245
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,030
other can you have a three versus three
or is it only one versus one can we have

246
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,040
or is it only one versus one can we have
 

247
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,110
or is it only one versus one can we have
two versus two cuz we're six people two

248
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:40,120
two versus two cuz we're six people two
 

249
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,790
two versus two cuz we're six people two
then I guess two people would be waiting

250
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:41,800
then I guess two people would be waiting
 

251
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,470
then I guess two people would be waiting
for a bit

252
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:44,480
for a bit
 

253
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,030
for a bit
but there is free versus

254
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:48,040
but there is free versus
 

255
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,629
but there is free versus
free wait so free countries that are

256
00:12:51,629 --> 00:12:51,639
free wait so free countries that are
 

257
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:53,870
free wait so free countries that are
playing together against other free

258
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:53,880
playing together against other free
 

259
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,590
playing together against other free
countries at once that feels like a lot

260
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:56,600
countries at once that feels like a lot
 

261
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,829
countries at once that feels like a lot
is going

262
00:12:57,829 --> 00:12:57,839
is going
 

263
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,030
is going
on damn four versus four is Max 2 versus

264
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:02,040
on damn four versus four is Max 2 versus
 

265
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:06,189
on damn four versus four is Max 2 versus
2 versus two all six

266
00:13:06,189 --> 00:13:06,199

 

267
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:08,750

waa oh then I feel like the fairest

268
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:08,760
waa oh then I feel like the fairest
 

269
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,030
waa oh then I feel like the fairest
would be 2 versus 2 versus two pairing

270
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,040
would be 2 versus 2 versus two pairing
 

271
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,629
would be 2 versus 2 versus two pairing
up an experienced ID member with a Noto

any I heard two versus two versus two is
 

285
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,509
any I heard two versus two versus two is
possible and maybe the fairest because I

286
00:13:41,509 --> 00:13:41,519
possible and maybe the fairest because I
 

287
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,230
possible and maybe the fairest because I
think ID

288
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:43,240
think ID
 

289
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:50,069
think ID
has way more skills than Ian

290
00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:50,079

 

291
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,509

L yeah let's see let's see I have no

295
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,910
idea what's planned oh and also um so
for today so far I've only played like a

296
00:13:59,910 --> 00:13:59,920
for today so far I've only played like a
 

297
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:05,150
for today so far I've only played like a
few uh campaigns single player but

298
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:05,160
few uh campaigns single player but
 

299
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,910
few uh campaigns single player but
somebody uh suggested and I agree with

300
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:07,920
somebody uh suggested and I agree with
 

301
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,110
somebody uh suggested and I agree with
that for today it might be best to just

302
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,120
that for today it might be best to just
 

303
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,790
that for today it might be best to just
play um skirmishes against

304
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:14,800
play um skirmishes against
 

305
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,629
play um skirmishes against
CPUs because that way it will be more

306
00:14:17,629 --> 00:14:17,639
CPUs because that way it will be more
 

307
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:21,550
CPUs because that way it will be more
like the actual uh tournament

308
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:21,560
like the actual uh tournament
 

309
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,710
like the actual uh tournament
right um and then I realized can you

310
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:24,720
right um and then I realized can you
 

311
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,269
right um and then I realized can you
even pause game

312
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:27,279
even pause game
 

313
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,030
even pause game
in skirm like when you play against

314
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:30,040
in skirm like when you play against
 

315
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,389
in skirm like when you play against
another real

316
00:14:31,389 --> 00:14:31,399
another real
 

317
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:32,910
another real
person

318
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:32,920
person
 

319
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,150
person
because does that pause their game too

320
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:36,160
because does that pause their game too
 

321
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,990
because does that pause their game too
or are you in an advantage the more you

322
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:38,000
or are you in an advantage the more you
 

323
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,749
or are you in an advantage the more you
pause your game or no you can't yes you

324
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:42,759

what I thought that's so stressful cuz I

328
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:48,560
what I thought that's so stressful cuz I
 

329
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,389
what I thought that's so stressful cuz I
need to pause to

330
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:52,399

 

331
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,269

think you can request a pause game would

332
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:55,279
think you can request a pause game would
 

333
00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:00,509
