Minecraft a way of playing Minecraft

2668
01:15:38,629 --> 01:15:38,639
Minecraft a way of playing Minecraft
 

2669
01:15:38,639 --> 01:15:42,189
Minecraft a way of playing Minecraft
where you start out with one block

2670
01:15:42,189 --> 01:15:42,199
where you start out with one block
 

2671
01:15:42,199 --> 01:15:44,430
where you start out with one block
there's no world you are building the

2672
01:15:44,430 --> 01:15:44,440
there's no world you are building the
 

2673
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:46,990
there's no world you are building the
world one block at a time and the block

2674
01:15:46,990 --> 01:15:47,000
world one block at a time and the block
 

2675
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,669
world one block at a time and the block
that you get is

2676
01:15:48,669 --> 01:15:48,679
that you get is
 

2677
01:15:48,679 --> 01:15:50,870
that you get is
random uh I think in the beginning you

2678
01:15:50,870 --> 01:15:50,880
random uh I think in the beginning you
 

2679
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:54,390
random uh I think in the beginning you
just stand on one block too right like

2680
01:15:54,390 --> 01:15:54,400
just stand on one block too right like
 

2681
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:57,910
just stand on one block too right like
in those in the middle of nothing you

2682
01:15:57,910 --> 01:15:57,920
in those in the middle of nothing you
 

2683
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:00,390
in those in the middle of nothing you
stand on one it's like in that way it's

2684
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:00,400
stand on one it's like in that way it's
 

2685
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:04,669
stand on one it's like in that way it's
like Sky block block I

2686
01:16:04,669 --> 01:16:04,679

 

2687
01:16:04,679 --> 01:16:07,430

guess yeah you stand on like one block

2688
01:16:07,430 --> 01:16:07,440
guess yeah you stand on like one block
 

2689
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:08,709
guess yeah you stand on like one block
and then you get another block and then

2690
01:16:08,709 --> 01:16:08,719
and then you get another block and then
 

2691
01:16:08,719 --> 01:16:09,830
and then you get another block and then
you get another block and you get

2692
01:16:09,830 --> 01:16:09,840
you get another block and you get
 

2693
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:10,910
you get another block and you get
another block but it could be any kind

2694
01:16:10,910 --> 01:16:10,920
another block but it could be any kind
 

2695
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:14,629
another block but it could be any kind
of block it could uh it could be

2696
01:16:14,629 --> 01:16:14,639
of block it could uh it could be
 

2697
01:16:14,639 --> 01:16:16,870
of block it could uh it could be
anything and we do this together and we

2698
01:16:16,870 --> 01:16:16,880
anything and we do this together and we
 

2699
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:19,310
