01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:50,069

but that's why we're not doing 12 hours

2294
01:03:50,069 --> 01:03:50,079
but that's why we're not doing 12 hours

but that's why we're not doing 12 hours

3343
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:01,189

it does not work really

3353
01:32:23,679 --> 01:32:25,590
it makes sense to me
because the saliva is what causes the

3821
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:22,950
putting snakes on a plane that's so
funny

3822
01:44:22,950 --> 01:44:22,960
funny
 

3823
01:44:22,960 --> 01:44:25,350
funny
because like snakes on a plane would not

3824
01:44:25,350 --> 01:44:25,360
because like snakes on a plane would not
 

3825
01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:27,990
because like snakes on a plane would not
be a problem at all

3826
01:44:27,990 --> 01:44:28,000
be a problem at all
 

3827
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:31,350
be a problem at all
like what are the snakes gonna do

3828
01:44:31,350 --> 01:44:31,360
like what are the snakes gonna do
 

3829
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:32,950
like what are the snakes gonna do
they're not gonna do anything they're

3830
01:44:32,950 --> 01:44:32,960
they're not gonna do anything they're
 

3831
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:34,950
they're not gonna do anything they're
probably terrified

3832
01:44:34,950 --> 01:44:34,960
probably terrified
 

3833
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:39,990
probably terrified
i don't know

3834
01:44:39,990 --> 01:44:40,000

 

3835
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,229

maybe if they're like super venomous i

3836
01:44:42,229 --> 01:44:42,239
maybe if they're like super venomous i
 

3837
01:44:42,239 --> 01:44:46,950
maybe if they're like super venomous i
guess that would be pretty bad

3838
01:44:46,950 --> 01:44:46,960

 

3839
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:49,109

i guess if people start panicking then

3840
01:44:49,109 --> 01:44:49,119
i guess if people start panicking then
 

3841
01:44:49,119 --> 01:44:51,910
i guess if people start panicking then
that's also going to be a problem

3842
01:44:51,910 --> 01:44:51,920
that's also going to be a problem
 

3843
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:57,910
that's also going to be a problem

powerful but
 

3859
01:45:21,119 --> 01:45:22,950
powerful but
it's like it's only really dangerous if

3860
01:45:22,950 --> 01:45:22,960
it's like it's only really dangerous if
 

3861
01:45:22,960 --> 01:45:26,550
