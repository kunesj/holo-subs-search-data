guess oh wait we attach it
to the platform by any

6624
03:13:41,870 --> 03:13:41,880
to the platform by any
 

6625
03:13:41,880 --> 03:13:51,550

for shrines I feel like it's basically a
 

6635
03:14:06,680 --> 03:14:10,710
for shrines I feel like it's basically a
portal like every Shrine is a portal

6636
03:14:10,710 --> 03:14:10,720
portal like every Shrine is a portal
 

6637

during my whole portal and the other
 

6645
03:14:21,880 --> 03:14:23,389
during my whole portal and the other
game

6646
03:14:23,389 --> 03:14:23,399

can't imagine them doing that all the

12396
06:05:13,350 --> 06:05:13,360
can't imagine them doing that all the
 

12397
06:05:13,360 --> 06:05:19,390
can't imagine them doing that all the
time and

12398
06:05:19,390 --> 06:05:19,400

 

12399
06:05:19,400 --> 06:05:24,750

yeah so going back to the usual

12400
06:05:24,750 --> 06:05:24,760
yeah so going back to the usual
 

12401
06:05:24,760 --> 06:05:27,030
yeah so going back to the usual
style is also going to be difficult

12402
06:05:27,030 --> 06:05:27,040
style is also going to be difficult
 

12403
06:05:27,040 --> 06:05:29,868
style is also going to be difficult
though because like you hyped up so many

12404
06:05:29,868 --> 06:05:29,878
though because like you hyped up so many
 

12405
06:05:29,878 --> 06:05:32,990
though because like you hyped up so many
people that are also kind of new to zala

12406
06:05:32,990 --> 06:05:33,000

12409
06:05:36,240 --> 06:05:38,788

so now a lot of people expect something

12410
06:05:38,788 --> 06:05:38,798
so now a lot of people expect something
 

12411
06:05:38,798 --> 06:05:41,310
so now a lot of people expect something
as big and intricate as this but they

12412
06:05:41,310 --> 06:05:41,320
as big and intricate as this but they
 

12413
06:05:41,320 --> 06:05:43,990
as big and intricate as this but they
can't do this all the time then then the

12414
06:05:43,990 --> 06:05:44,000
can't do this all the time then then the
 

12415
06:05:44,000 --> 06:05:45,750
can't do this all the time then then the
daa fans would probably be really mad I

12416
06:05:45,750 --> 06:05:45,760
daa fans would probably be really mad I
 

12417
06:05:45,760 --> 06:05:48,670
daa fans would probably be really mad I
think they can forgive a game like this

12418
06:05:48,670 --> 06:05:48,680
think they can forgive a game like this
 

12419
06:05:48,680 --> 06:05:51,270
think they can forgive a game like this
because it's really great one or two

12420
06:05:51,270 --> 06:05:51,280
because it's really great one or two
 

12421
06:05:51,280 --> 06:05:53,628
because it's really great one or two
times but then afterwards they probably

12422
06:05:53,628 --> 06:05:53,638
times but then afterwards they probably
 

12423
06:05:53,638 --> 06:05:56,788
times but then afterwards they probably
want like a typical Zelda game again for

12424
06:05:56,788 --> 06:05:56,798
want like a typical Zelda game again for
 

12425
06:05:56,798 --> 06:05:59,468
want like a typical Zelda game again for
now it's cool but like you know we want

12426
06:05:59,468 --> 06:05:59,478
now it's cool but like you know we want
 

12427
06:05:59,478 --> 06:06:01,548
now it's cool but like you know we want
a typical Zelda game

12428
06:06:01,548 --> 06:06:01,558
a typical Zelda game
 

12429
06:06:01,558 --> 06:06:05,868
a typical Zelda game
right so the Zelda fans will be happy

12430
06:06:05,868 --> 06:06:05,878
right so the Zelda fans will be happy
 

12431
06:06:05,878 --> 06:06:08,548
right so the Zelda fans will be happy
probably if they just go back to a

12432
06:06:08,548 --> 06:06:08,558
probably if they just go back to a
 

12433
06:06:08,558 --> 06:06:10,270
probably if they just go back to a
normal Zelda game but then I think for

12434
06:06:10,270 --> 06:06:10,280
normal Zelda game but then I think for
 

12435
06:06:10,280 --> 06:06:14,510
normal Zelda game but then I think for
the creators as well it will be like

12436
06:06:14,510 --> 06:06:14,520
the creators as well it will be like
 

12437
06:06:14,520 --> 06:06:16,670
the creators as well it will be like
like almost feel

12438
06:06:16,670 --> 06:06:16,680
like almost feel
 

12439
06:06:16,680 --> 06:06:18,230
like almost feel
wrong

12440
06:06:18,230 --> 06:06:18,240
wrong
 

12441
06:06:18,240 --> 06:06:21,548
wrong
maybe it will cuz it will be I suppose

12442
06:06:21,548 --> 06:06:21,558
maybe it will cuz it will be I suppose
 

12443
06:06:21,558 --> 06:06:25,788
maybe it will cuz it will be I suppose
easier to make a non-open world

12444
06:06:25,788 --> 06:06:25,798

 

12445
06:06:25,798 --> 06:06:29,350

game and I mean all the effort you're

12446
06:06:29,350 --> 06:06:29,360
game and I mean all the effort you're
 

12447
06:06:29,360 --> 06:06:30,468
game and I mean all the effort you're
not putting

12448
06:06:30,468 --> 06:06:30,478
not putting
 

12449
06:06:30,478 --> 06:06:33,350
not putting
into uh it to be an open world game I

12450
06:06:33,350 --> 06:06:33,360
into uh it to be an open world game I
 

12451
06:06:33,360 --> 06:06:35,628
into uh it to be an open world game I
guess you could focus onto other stuff

12452
06:06:35,628 --> 06:06:35,638
guess you could focus onto other stuff
 

12453
06:06:35,638 --> 06:06:39,070
guess you could focus onto other stuff
like graphic and all that but yeah I

12454
06:06:39,070 --> 06:06:39,080
like graphic and all that but yeah I
 

12455
06:06:39,080 --> 06:06:40,350
like graphic and all that but yeah I
think it will be difficult for the

12456
06:06:40,350 --> 06:06:40,360
think it will be difficult for the
 

12457
06:06:40,360 --> 06:06:42,910
think it will be difficult for the
developers and then also like you you

12458
06:06:42,910 --> 06:06:42,920
developers and then also like you you
 

12459
06:06:42,920 --> 06:06:45,270
developers and then also like you you
just have so many expectations from

12460
06:06:45,270 --> 06:06:45,280
just have so many expectations from
 

12461
06:06:45,280 --> 06:06:48,548
just have so many expectations from
people now but generally I think they

12462
06:06:48,548 --> 06:06:48,558
people now but generally I think they
 

12463
06:06:48,558 --> 06:06:50,948
people now but generally I think they
don't need to worry too much about it

12464
06:06:50,948 --> 06:06:50,958
don't need to worry too much about it
 

12465
06:06:50,958 --> 06:06:55,110
don't need to worry too much about it
and just make a 2d no no not 2D 3D 2D uh

12466
06:06:55,110 --> 06:06:55,120
and just make a 2d no no not 2D 3D 2D uh
 

12467
06:06:55,120 --> 06:06:58,590
and just make a 2d no no not 2D 3D 2D uh
whatever mixture typical Zelda game with

12468
06:06:58,590 --> 06:06:58,600
whatever mixture typical Zelda game with
 

12469
06:06:58,600 --> 06:07:01,070
whatever mixture typical Zelda game with
Dungeons and all that and everybody will

be happy or even like a
 

12473
06:07:02,718 --> 06:07:06,830
be happy or even like a
3D again but typical Z style of dungeons

12474
06:07:06,830 --> 06:07:06,840
3D again but typical Z style of dungeons
 

12475
06:07:06,840 --> 06:07:09,708
3D again but typical Z style of dungeons
like um like Skyward Sword

12476
06:07:09,708 --> 06:07:09,718
like um like Skyward Sword
 

12477
06:07:09,718 --> 06:07:12,190
like um like Skyward Sword
or uh

12478
06:07:12,190 --> 06:07:12,200
or uh
 

12479

06:07:16,030 --> 06:07:16,040
um what's it called The Dark
 

12481
06:07:16,040 --> 06:07:19,030
um what's it called The Dark

One what's the dark one called forgot
 

12483
06:07:19,040 --> 06:07:20,310
One what's the dark one called forgot
Twilight Princess yeah that's the one I

12484
06:07:20,310 --> 06:07:20,320
Twilight Princess yeah that's the one I
 

12485
06:07:20,320 --> 06:07:21,310
Twilight Princess yeah that's the one I
was thinking

12486
06:07:21,310 --> 06:07:21,320
was thinking
 

12487
06:07:21,320 --> 06:07:27,468
was thinking
of just something like that then I think

12488
06:07:27,468 --> 06:07:27,478
of just something like that then I think
 

12489
06:07:27,478 --> 06:07:31,590
of just something like that then I think
that would be a good mix you're still um

12490
06:07:31,590 --> 06:07:31,600
that would be a good mix you're still um
 

12491
06:07:31,600 --> 06:07:36,590
that would be a good mix you're still um
proceeding with nice 3D graphics

12492
06:07:36,590 --> 06:07:36,600
proceeding with nice 3D graphics
 

12493
06:07:36,600 --> 06:07:39,750
proceeding with nice 3D graphics
uh and and but you can go back to the

12494
06:07:39,750 --> 06:07:39,760
uh and and but you can go back to the
 

12495
06:07:39,760 --> 06:07:42,270
uh and and but you can go back to the
classics in terms of mechanics and all

12496
06:07:42,270 --> 06:07:42,280
classics in terms of mechanics and all
 

12497
06:07:42,280 --> 06:07:45,230
classics in terms of mechanics and all
that

12498
06:07:45,230 --> 06:07:45,240

 

12499
06:07:45,240 --> 06:07:52,310

worried about you know what to do next
how how about they just do a

12566
06:09:36,948 --> 06:09:36,958
how how about they just do a
 

12567
06:09:36,958 --> 06:09:40,150
how how about they just do a
remake of one of the really old

12568
06:09:40,150 --> 06:09:40,160
remake of one of the really old
 

12569
06:09:40,160 --> 06:09:43,110
remake of one of the really old
ones I mean I guess they already just

12570
06:09:43,110 --> 06:09:43,120
ones I mean I guess they already just
 

12571
06:09:43,120 --> 06:09:46,070
ones I mean I guess they already just
did a remake with

12572
06:09:46,070 --> 06:09:46,080
did a remake with
 

12573
06:09:46,080 --> 06:09:48,708
did a remake with
um not Skyward Sword that was a remaster

12574
06:09:48,708 --> 06:09:48,718
