i have a lot a lot to read possibly
 

385

i have a lot a lot to read possibly
and the only next time where i could

386

and the only next time where i could
 

387
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,910

we we could just do it for one stream

440

445
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,590
just be
to do it for one stream because i have

446
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:33,600
to do it for one stream because i have
 

447
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,430
to do it for one stream because i have
so many other streams going on so many

like
 

2441
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:32,870
like
it's also a different feeling from

01:05:32,870 --> 01:05:32,880
it's also a different feeling from
 

2443
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:35,109
it's also a different feeling from
uploading a video

2444
01:05:35,109 --> 01:05:35,119
uploading a video
 

2445
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:38,150
uploading a video
and then livestream and live streaming

2446
01:05:38,150 --> 01:05:38,160
and then livestream and live streaming
 

2447
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:39,270
and then livestream and live streaming
in there it's just different

2448
01:05:39,270 --> 01:05:39,280
in there it's just different
 

2449
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:41,589
in there it's just different
so i do get that but personally for

2450
01:05:41,589 --> 01:05:41,599
so i do get that but personally for
 

2451
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:43,510
so i do get that but personally for
myself i wouldn't have mined it either

2452
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:43,520
myself i wouldn't have mined it either
 

2453
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:44,710
myself i wouldn't have mined it either
way

2454
01:05:44,710 --> 01:05:44,720
way
 

2455
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:48,390
way
um because at least i could have avoided

2456
01:05:48,390 --> 01:05:48,400
um because at least i could have avoided
 

2457
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,390
um because at least i could have avoided
technical issues if it was

2458
01:05:50,390 --> 01:05:50,400
technical issues if it was
 

2459
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,430
technical issues if it was
not live but yeah

2460
01:05:53,430 --> 01:05:53,440
not live but yeah
 

2461
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,510

2465
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:01,589

i also don't think if it would have been

2466
01:06:01,589 --> 01:06:01,599
i also don't think if it would have been
 

2467
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:03,190
i also don't think if it would have been
um

2468
01:06:03,190 --> 01:06:03,200
um
 

2469
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:06,870
um
just a video premiere i don't think that

2470
01:06:06,870 --> 01:06:06,880
just a video premiere i don't think that
 

2471
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,390
just a video premiere i don't think that
it would have

2472
01:06:08,390 --> 01:06:08,400
it would have
 

2473
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,470
it would have
gotten so much attention for some reason

2474
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:10,480
gotten so much attention for some reason
 

2475
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:12,230
gotten so much attention for some reason
i don't know why i think that way that's

2476
01:06:12,230 --> 01:06:12,240
i don't know why i think that way that's
 

2477
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:14,230
i don't know why i think that way that's
just my theory

2478
01:06:14,230 --> 01:06:14,240
just my theory
 

2479
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:16,069
just my theory
but there were like so many viewers in

2480
01:06:16,069 --> 01:06:16,079
but there were like so many viewers in
 

2481
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:17,589
but there were like so many viewers in
almost 60k

2482
01:06:17,589 --> 01:06:17,599
almost 60k
 

2483
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:20,630
almost 60k

holy i i for some reason don't
 

2485
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:21,430
holy i i for some reason don't
think that a

2486
01:06:21,430 --> 01:06:21,440
think that a
 

2487
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:23,670
think that a
live premiere of a video would have

2488
01:06:23,670 --> 01:06:23,680
live premiere of a video would have
 

2489
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:25,990
live premiere of a video would have
gotten that much attention

2490
01:06:25,990 --> 01:06:26,000
gotten that much attention
 

2491
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,309
gotten that much attention
even though there's a lot of people who

01:06:33,109 --> 01:06:33,119
notice the difference between
 

2497
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:35,430
notice the difference between
a live premiere of a video and a live

2498
01:06:35,430 --> 01:06:35,440
a live premiere of a video and a live
 

2499

for example money money in the manager
 

2895
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:01,669
for example money money in the manager
as well and they

2896
01:16:01,669 --> 01:16:01,679
as well and they
 

2897
01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:03,350
as well and they
like they they're our managers are

2898
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:03,360
like they they're our managers are
 

2899
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:05,669
like they they're our managers are
really nice and they tell us to

take our days off
 

2905
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:12,870
take our days off
and i think there's really no reason to

2906
01:16:12,870 --> 01:16:12,880
and i think there's really no reason to
 

2907
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:14,790
and i think there's really no reason to
force ourselves to work out every

2908
01:16:14,790 --> 01:16:14,800
force ourselves to work out every
 

2909
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:18,870
force ourselves to work out every
uh stream every day but

2910
01:16:18,870 --> 01:16:18,880
uh stream every day but
 

2911
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:23,510
uh stream every day but
it's just a mental work mentality thing

2912
01:16:23,510 --> 01:16:23,520
it's just a mental work mentality thing
 

2913
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:26,630
it's just a mental work mentality thing
no matter if your managers tell you

i think it's very hard for them

2918
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:37,520
i think it's very hard for them
 

2919
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:40,470
i think it's very hard for them
to actually you know take a break

european prime time is probably

8678
04:03:07,590 --> 04:03:07,600

 

8679
04:03:07,600 --> 04:03:11,110

yeah and pretty much everything that i
 

10385
04:56:46,718 --> 04:56:48,310
yeah and pretty much everything that i
did not understand

10386
04:56:48,310 --> 04:56:48,320
did not understand
 

10387
04:56:48,320 --> 04:56:52,390
did not understand
just i i didn't even have to try to

10388
04:56:52,390 --> 04:56:52,400
just i i didn't even have to try to
 

10389
04:56:52,400 --> 04:56:53,830
just i i didn't even have to try to
remember it

10390
04:56:53,830 --> 04:56:53,840
remember it
 

10391
04:56:53,840 --> 04:56:55,670
remember it
i don't know why this is only with

10392
04:56:55,670 --> 04:56:55,680
i don't know why this is only with
 

10393
04:56:55,680 --> 04:56:57,270
i don't know why this is only with
japanese language with other languages i

10394
04:56:57,270 --> 04:56:57,280
japanese language with other languages i
 

10395
04:56:57,280 --> 04:56:59,430
japanese language with other languages i
didn't learn it that easily but

10396
04:56:59,430 --> 04:56:59,440
didn't learn it that easily but
 

10397
04:56:59,440 --> 04:57:02,310
didn't learn it that easily but
every time i saw a word that i didn't

10398
04:57:02,310 --> 04:57:02,320
every time i saw a word that i didn't
 

10399
04:57:02,320 --> 04:57:05,270
every time i saw a word that i didn't
know before it just stayed in my head

10400
04:57:05,270 --> 04:57:05,280
know before it just stayed in my head
 

10401
04:57:05,280 --> 04:57:06,948
know before it just stayed in my head
and did not leave me afterwards but i

10402
04:57:06,948 --> 04:57:06,958
and did not leave me afterwards but i
 

10403
04:57:06,958 --> 04:57:08,230
and did not leave me afterwards but i
think really the biggest reason is

10404
04:57:08,230 --> 04:57:08,240
think really the biggest reason is
 

10405
04:57:08,240 --> 04:57:09,750
think really the biggest reason is
because i was really trying to speak

10406
04:57:09,750 --> 04:57:09,760
because i was really trying to speak
 

10407
04:57:09,760 --> 04:57:11,910
because i was really trying to speak
japanese every day

10408
04:57:11,910 --> 04:57:11,920
japanese every day
 

10409
04:57:11,920 --> 04:57:15,510
japanese every day
uh so if you are consistent and

uh so if you are consistent and
 

10411
04:57:15,520 --> 04:57:18,550
uh so if you are consistent and
try to use the language every day

10412
