and i wrote
 

249
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,110
and i wrote
does someone have the coordinates uh of

250
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:01,120
does someone have the coordinates uh of
 

251
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,309
does someone have the coordinates uh of
of of

252
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:02,319
of of
 

253
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,710

the what did i what exactly was like our

254
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:04,720
the what did i what exactly was like our
 

255
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,830
the what did i what exactly was like our
whole homework

256
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:05,840
whole homework
 

257
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,869
whole homework
nether you want the coordinates for it

258
00:08:08,869 --> 00:08:08,879
nether you want the coordinates for it
 

259
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,390
nether you want the coordinates for it
yeah it was uh we had some communication

260
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:12,400
yeah it was uh we had some communication
 

261
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,510
yeah it was uh we had some communication
issues there

262
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:13,520
issues there
 

263
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,110

because i wrote does someone have the
 

265
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,869
because i wrote does someone have the
coordinates of our main

266
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:16,879
coordinates of our main
 

267
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,990
coordinates of our main
nava portal i got lost and i took the

268
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:20,000
nava portal i got lost and i took the
 

269
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,790
nava portal i got lost and i took the
coordinates

270
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:20,800
coordinates
 

271
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,670
coordinates
standing right here you sent them to me

272
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:23,680
standing right here you sent them to me
 

273
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,869
standing right here you sent them to me
and then i was following those

274

and then i was following those
 

275
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,950
and then i was following those
coordinates for like an hour

276
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:26,960
coordinates for like an hour
 

277
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,830
coordinates for like an hour
and i was like yep i'm pretty much there

278
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:29,840
and i was like yep i'm pretty much there
 

279

finding
to following those coordinates i found

288
00:08:39,829 --> 00:08:39,839
to following those coordinates i found
 

289
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:40,790
to following those coordinates i found
good as

290
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:40,800
good as
 

291
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,070

were you realized i was like here are
 

325
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,389
were you realized i was like here are
you are you in the nether

326
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:18,399

 

327
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,949

i was like another coordinator

328
00:09:22,949 --> 00:09:22,959
i was like another coordinator
 

329
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,710
i was like another coordinator
so then she gave me the real coordinates

330
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:24,720
so then she gave me the real coordinates
 

331
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,070
so then she gave me the real coordinates
and then i was following the real

332
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:26,080
and then i was following the real
 

333
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,310
and then i was following the real
coordinates but they were so far away

334
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:28,320
coordinates but they were so far away
 

335
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,070
coordinates but they were so far away
and then i i really couldn't find it

336
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:30,080
and then i i really couldn't find it
 

337
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,480
and then i i really couldn't find it
anymore

338
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:30,490
anymore
 

339
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:32,870
anymore
[Laughter]

340
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:32,880

and then then however i i um
 

343
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,829
and then then however i i um
i got to the point where i found my path

344
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:39,839
i got to the point where i found my path
 

345
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,990
i got to the point where i found my path
again at least and the path was

346
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,000
again at least and the path was
 

347
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,269
again at least and the path was
this this single block path that gura

348
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:45,279
this this single block path that gura
 

349
