several reasons

64
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:12,720

 

65
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,950

00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:17,280
yeah
 

71
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,550
yeah
even though my stream is at 12. why

72
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:20,560
even though my stream is at 12. why
 

73
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,589
even though my stream is at 12. why
because

74
00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:21,599
because
 

75
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,670
because
no because um

76
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:23,680
no because um
 

77
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,830
no because um
i

78
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:25,840
i
 

79
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,029
i
uh

80
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:27,039
uh
 

81
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,189
uh
there was like um

82
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:29,199
there was like um
 

83
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,189
there was like um
well

84
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:31,199

85
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,629
well
generally the reason i'm trying to wake

86
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:32,639
generally the reason i'm trying to wake
 

87
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,790
generally the reason i'm trying to wake
up earlier was for the stream and

88
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:34,800
up earlier was for the stream and
 

89
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,189
up earlier was for the stream and
because also i

90
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:37,199
because also i
 

91
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,469
because also i
need to

92
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:38,479

93
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,909
need to
like sleep early today desperately

94
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:41,919
like sleep early today desperately

96
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:44,639
for the sake of popcorn
 

97
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,670
for the sake of popcorn
and then

98
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:45,680
and then
 

99
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,550
and then
uh i needed to get up like one hour

100
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:48,560
uh i needed to get up like one hour
 

101
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,189
uh i needed to get up like one hour
earlier because one hour before the

102
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:51,199
earlier because one hour before the
 

103
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,629
earlier because one hour before the
stream

104
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:52,639
stream
 

105
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,189
stream
me and bae did a little bit of a tech

106
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:55,199
me and bae did a little bit of a tech
 

107
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,589
me and bae did a little bit of a tech

00:07:57,589 --> 00:07:57,599

 

109
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,189

so that was

110
00:07:59,189 --> 00:07:59,199
so that was
 

111
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,230
so that was
my minus one hour and then i

112
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:02,240
my minus one hour and then i
 

113
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,029
my minus one hour and then i
i was gonna wake up like a half an hour

114
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:05,039
i was gonna wake up like a half an hour
 

115
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,629
i was gonna wake up like a half an hour
before that or so or actually 40 50

116
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:08,639
before that or so or actually 40 50
 

117
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,909
before that or so or actually 40 50
minutes because i wanted to get

so that was another minus one hour

122
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:14,000
so that was another minus one hour
 

123
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,189

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,749
but
i woke up even earlier than that

126
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:17,759

let's do that trick how much does it eat

3178
01:24:56,629 --> 01:24:56,639
let's do that trick how much does it eat
 

3179
01:24:56,639 --> 01:24:58,149
let's do that trick how much does it eat
like

3180
01:24:58,149 --> 01:24:58,159
like
 

3181
01:24:58,159 --> 01:24:59,990
like
per

3182
01:24:59,990 --> 01:25:00,000
per
 

3183
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:10,310
per
day per rest day i guess

3184
01:25:10,310 --> 01:25:10,320

 

3185
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:12,790

let's do like do it like this

3186
01:25:12,790 --> 01:25:12,800
let's do like do it like this
 

3187
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:16,070
let's do like do it like this
yeah okay

3188
01:25:16,070 --> 01:25:16,080

 

3189
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:22,070

this should work

3190
01:25:22,070 --> 01:25:22,080

 

3191
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:26,070

they eat stupidly fast

3192
01:25:26,070 --> 01:25:26,080
they eat stupidly fast
 

3193
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:28,709
they eat stupidly fast
uh what about

3194
01:25:28,709 --> 01:25:28,719
uh what about
 

3195
01:25:28,719 --> 01:25:31,270
uh what about
like tuna cans and bean cans and all

3196
01:25:31,270 --> 01:25:31,280

01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:33,750
like tuna cans and bean cans and all
that does that work i guess not probably

3198
01:25:33,750 --> 01:25:33,760
that does that work i guess not probably
 

3199
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:38,390
that does that work i guess not probably
not

3200
01:25:38,390 --> 01:25:38,400

 

3201
