this stream so far I wonder if there's a
lot of people who just never saw the

06:36:41,788 --> 06:36:41,798
lot of people who just never saw the
 

10479
06:36:41,798 --> 06:36:44,548
lot of people who just never saw the
game before or if there's again mostly

10480
06:36:44,548 --> 06:36:44,558
game before or if there's again mostly
 

10481
06:36:44,558 --> 06:36:46,990
game before or if there's again mostly
people who already played the game or if

10482
06:36:46,990 --> 06:36:47,000
people who already played the game or if
 

10483
06:36:47,000 --> 06:36:50,310
people who already played the game or if
it's like half half or

10484

was the first one to go she didn't she

10746
06:43:50,830 --> 06:43:50,840
was the first one to go she didn't she
 

10747
06:43:50,840 --> 06:43:52,590

06:43:52,590 --> 06:43:52,600
didn't know what we were going to do I
 

10749
06:43:52,600 --> 06:43:54,948
didn't know what we were going to do I
feel like maybe she if she knew what we

10750
06:43:54,948 --> 06:43:54,958
feel like maybe she if she knew what we
 

10751
06:43:54,958 --> 06:43:56,350
feel like maybe she if she knew what we
were going to do she would have maybe

10752
06:43:56,350 --> 06:43:56,360
were going to do she would have maybe
 

10753
06:43:56,360 --> 06:44:00,190
were going to do she would have maybe
done a bit more but uh I think it's

10754
06:44:00,190 --> 06:44:00,200
done a bit more but uh I think it's
 

10755
06:44:00,200 --> 06:44:02,548
done a bit more but uh I think it's
totally fine to reveal it normally but

10756
06:44:02,548 --> 06:44:02,558
totally fine to reveal it normally but
 

10757
06:44:02,558 --> 06:44:04,510
totally fine to reveal it normally but
being the first is a bit difficult cuz

10758
06:44:04,510 --> 06:44:04,520
being the first is a bit difficult cuz
