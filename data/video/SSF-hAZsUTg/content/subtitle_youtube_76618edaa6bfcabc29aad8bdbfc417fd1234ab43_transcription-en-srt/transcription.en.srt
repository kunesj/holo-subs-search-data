9739
03:46:10,680 --> 03:46:12,550
but I uh I I wrote a little something
because um I'm not really good at these

9745
03:46:18,159 --> 03:46:21,149
the fly so I pre-wrote some things just
so I could get most of it out obviously

a solar was after all she's living under

10606
04:07:34,429 --> 04:07:34,439
a solar was after all she's living under
 

10607
04:07:34,439 --> 04:07:39,309
a solar was after all she's living under
a rock yeah all I saw was just

04:07:39,309 --> 04:07:39,319
a rock yeah all I saw was just
 

10609
04:07:39,319 --> 04:07:44,030
a rock yeah all I saw was just
darkness whatever the opposite of solar

10610
04:07:44,030 --> 04:07:44,040
darkness whatever the opposite of solar
 

10611
04:07:44,040 --> 04:07:46,790
darkness whatever the opposite of solar
is um lunar

10612
04:07:46,790 --> 04:07:46,800
is um lunar
 

10613
04:07:46,800 --> 04:07:49,149
is um lunar
lunar

10614
04:07:49,149 --> 04:07:49,159
lunar
 

10615
04:07:49,159 --> 04:07:52,229
lunar
wait but is it really a lunar if it's

10616
04:07:52,229 --> 04:07:52,239
wait but is it really a lunar if it's
 

10617
04:07:52,239 --> 04:07:56,030
wait but is it really a lunar if it's
just complete pitch black

10618
04:07:56,030 --> 04:07:56,040
just complete pitch black
 

10619
04:07:56,040 --> 04:07:59,510

pitch black but solar okay solar is the

10622
04:08:03,189 --> 04:08:03,199
pitch black but solar okay solar is the
 

10623
04:08:03,199 --> 04:08:05,389
pitch black but solar okay solar is the
Sun so the opposite of the sun would be

10624
04:08:05,389 --> 04:08:05,399
Sun so the opposite of the sun would be
 

10625
04:08:05,399 --> 04:08:07,830
Sun so the opposite of the sun would be
the lunar or the moon yeah but you can
