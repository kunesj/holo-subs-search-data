took home notes first impression i
noticed this is like a little bit way

588
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:22,160
noticed this is like a little bit way
 

589

anyway so seaplane yeah yeah we already
 

619
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,829
anyway so seaplane yeah yeah we already
talked about this look this is the the

620
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:01,839
talked about this look this is the the
 

621
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:02,790
talked about this look this is the the
the

622
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:02,800
the
 

623
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,430
the
cockpit is this also called the cockpit

624
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:05,440
cockpit is this also called the cockpit
 

625
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,269

there were two dudes i don't know

626
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:07,279
there were two dudes i don't know
 

627
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,910
there were two dudes i don't know
and um yeah

628

and um yeah
 

629
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,550
and um yeah
this was the shortest flight safety

630
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:12,560
this was the shortest flight safety
 

631
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,110
this was the shortest flight safety
instruction that i've ever had heard and

632
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:15,120
instruction that i've ever had heard and
 

633
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,629
instruction that i've ever had heard and
i wish they would do it that short in uh

634
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:18,639
i wish they would do it that short in uh
 

635
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,150
i wish they would do it that short in uh
emmy rates can i can i quickly like vent

636
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:22,160
emmy rates can i can i quickly like vent
 

637
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,310
emmy rates can i can i quickly like vent
about this

638
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:24,320
about this
 

639
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,269
about this
oh

640
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:25,279
oh
 

641
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,590
oh
i tried because you know when you fly

642
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:27,600
i tried because you know when you fly
 

643
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,910
i tried because you know when you fly
from europe somewhere like there's a

644
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:29,920
from europe somewhere like there's a
 

645
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,509
from europe somewhere like there's a
high chance that you're gonna try a

646
00:16:31,509 --> 00:16:31,519
high chance that you're gonna try a
 

647
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,069
high chance that you're gonna try a
million different european airlines so

648
00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:34,079
million different european airlines so
 

649
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,150
million different european airlines so
you see all kinds of different safety

650
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:36,160
you see all kinds of different safety
 

651
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,629
you see all kinds of different safety
instructions but

652
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:38,639
instructions but
 

653
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,030
instructions but
freaking emmy rates yo

654
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:41,040
freaking emmy rates yo
 

655
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,470
freaking emmy rates yo
they just absolutely overdo it like

656
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:44,480
they just absolutely overdo it like
 

657
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,910
they just absolutely overdo it like
their flight instruction starts with a a

658
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:47,920
their flight instruction starts with a a
 

659
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,910
their flight instruction starts with a a
video in in um

660
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:51,920

 

661
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,030

or

662
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:53,040
or
 

663
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,350
or
arabic

664
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:55,360
arabic
 

665
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,990
arabic
is that what you call the language

666
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,000
is that what you call the language
 

667
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,350
is that what you call the language
okay and then

668
00:16:59,350 --> 00:16:59,360
okay and then
 

669
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,590
okay and then
yo you could i've seen it in other

670
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:01,600
yo you could i've seen it in other
 

671
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,590
yo you could i've seen it in other
flights before they subtitle it so you

672
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:03,600
flights before they subtitle it so you
 

673
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,750
flights before they subtitle it so you
don't have to have

security vests
like in the first place though i don't

3296
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:21,040
like in the first place though i don't
 

3297
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:22,829
like in the first place though i don't
even know where we could get

3298
01:08:22,829 --> 01:08:22,839
even know where we could get
 

3299
01:08:22,839 --> 01:08:26,149
even know where we could get
them and then they were like people with

3300
01:08:26,149 --> 01:08:26,159
them and then they were like people with
 

3301
01:08:26,159 --> 01:08:28,070
them and then they were like people with
maybe there were people with shoes too

3302
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:28,080
maybe there were people with shoes too
 

3303
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:29,829
maybe there were people with shoes too
like but then i also kind of agree

3304
01:08:29,829 --> 01:08:29,839
like but then i also kind of agree
 

3305
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:32,149
like but then i also kind of agree
because like remember the the corals

3306
01:08:32,149 --> 01:08:32,159
because like remember the the corals
 

3307
01:08:32,159 --> 01:08:33,669
because like remember the the corals
were like kind of sharp

3308
01:08:33,669 --> 01:08:33,679
were like kind of sharp
 

3309
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:36,229
were like kind of sharp
so maybe next time i would consider

3310
01:08:36,229 --> 01:08:36,239
so maybe next time i would consider
 

3311
01:08:36,239 --> 01:08:38,789
so maybe next time i would consider
getting yeah the shoes the shoes make

3312
01:08:38,789 --> 01:08:38,799
getting yeah the shoes the shoes make
 

3313
01:08:38,799 --> 01:08:40,309
getting yeah the shoes the shoes make
sense yeah but i don't know about the

3314
01:08:40,309 --> 01:08:40,319
sense yeah but i don't know about the
