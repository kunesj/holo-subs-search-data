simply for that reason
 

3561
02:07:00,639 --> 02:07:03,030
simply for that reason
from where the developers are from and

3562
02:07:03,030 --> 02:07:03,040
from where the developers are from and
 

3563
02:07:03,040 --> 02:07:04,950
from where the developers are from and
from because uh the story seems to be

4419
02:32:15,680 --> 02:32:17,670

so i did that contract all over again

4420
02:32:17,670 --> 02:32:17,680
so i did that contract all over again
 

4421
02:32:17,680 --> 02:32:19,990
so i did that contract all over again
and i chose the the 12th october i think

4422
02:32:19,990 --> 02:32:20,000
and i chose the the 12th october i think
 

4423
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:20,710
and i chose the the 12th october i think
which would be

4424
02:32:20,710 --> 02:32:20,720
which would be
 

4425
02:32:20,720 --> 02:32:25,190
which would be
tomorrow and the day after tomorrow

4426
02:32:25,190 --> 02:32:25,200
tomorrow and the day after tomorrow
 

4427
02:32:25,200 --> 02:32:27,429
tomorrow and the day after tomorrow
and then you know it shows you like the

4428
02:32:27,429 --> 02:32:27,439
and then you know it shows you like the
 

4429
02:32:27,439 --> 02:32:28,950
and then you know it shows you like the
available dates

4430
02:32:28,950 --> 02:32:28,960
available dates
 

4431
02:32:28,960 --> 02:32:32,870
available dates
so it turns to 12. but then

4432
02:32:32,870 --> 02:32:32,880
so it turns to 12. but then
 

4433
02:32:32,880 --> 02:32:34,870
so it turns to 12. but then
one day later they they call and they're
