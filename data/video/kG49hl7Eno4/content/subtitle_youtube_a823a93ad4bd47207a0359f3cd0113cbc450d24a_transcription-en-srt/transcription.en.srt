challenge there's still the never and
 

8887
04:01:03,600 --> 04:01:05,429
challenge there's still the never and
end in one

8888
04:01:05,429 --> 04:01:05,439
end in one
 

8889
04:01:05,439 --> 04:01:08,950

10059
04:35:03,240 --> 04:35:05,390
rely on everything working so
well so I wouldn't want to plan a

10060
04:35:05,390 --> 04:35:05,400
well so I wouldn't want to plan a
 

10061
04:35:05,400 --> 04:35:07,349
well so I wouldn't want to plan a
project like this during a time like

10062
04:35:07,349 --> 04:35:07,359
project like this during a time like
 

10063
04:35:07,359 --> 04:35:09,869
project like this during a time like
that so ideally I'd want to do it in

10064
04:35:09,869 --> 04:35:09,879
that so ideally I'd want to do it in
 

10065
04:35:09,879 --> 04:35:11,789
that so ideally I'd want to do it in
June and then it really depends on if

10066
04:35:11,789 --> 04:35:11,799
June and then it really depends on if
 

10067
04:35:11,799 --> 04:35:14,230
June and then it really depends on if
the others are available in June for one

10068
04:35:14,230 --> 04:35:14,240
the others are available in June for one
 

10069
04:35:14,240 --> 04:35:16,510
the others are available in June for one
or two weeks

10070
04:35:16,510 --> 04:35:16,520

10071
04:35:16,520 --> 04:35:22,390
or two weeks
of you know playing a

10072
04:35:22,390 --> 04:35:22,400

 

10073
04:35:22,400 --> 04:35:25,429

bunch but you guys know we haven't been

10074
04:35:25,429 --> 04:35:25,439
bunch but you guys know we haven't been
 

10075
04:35:25,439 --> 04:35:28,910
bunch but you guys know we haven't been
doing many myth streams um so I think it

10076
04:35:28,910 --> 04:35:28,920
doing many myth streams um so I think it
 

10077
04:35:28,920 --> 04:35:32,189
doing many myth streams um so I think it
would be a nice project to bring myth

10078
04:35:32,189 --> 04:35:32,199
would be a nice project to bring myth
 

10079
04:35:32,199 --> 04:35:37,189
would be a nice project to bring myth
back a little bit

10080
04:35:37,189 --> 04:35:37,199

obvious to me at some point but maybe in
 

10391
04:42:26,120 --> 04:42:28,670
obvious to me at some point but maybe in
the beginning they should have said the

10392
04:42:28,670 --> 04:42:28,680
the beginning they should have said the
 

10393
