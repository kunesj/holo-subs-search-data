now i think so the one that you
 

561
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,430
now i think so the one that you
see right away is not the one where we

562
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:05,440
see right away is not the one where we
 

563
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,430
see right away is not the one where we
want to go we have to go in the exact

564
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:07,440
want to go we have to go in the exact
 

565
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,230
want to go we have to go in the exact
opposite

566
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:08,240
opposite
 

567
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,350
opposite
direction right i think

568
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:11,360
direction right i think
 

569
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,950
direction right i think
let's see

570
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:14,960
let's see
 

571
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,549
let's see
i think yeah i just still didn't put up

572
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:18,559
i think yeah i just still didn't put up
 

573
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,710
i think yeah i just still didn't put up
a sign

574
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:22,720

 

575
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,909

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,590
okinawa or the second one okinawa
i think the first one this is japan one

580
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:31,600
i think the first one this is japan one
 

581
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,789
i think the first one this is japan one
and this is okinawa

582
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:34,799

 

583
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,150

okinawa is this really my island

584
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:38,160

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,750

what's that

588
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:45,760
