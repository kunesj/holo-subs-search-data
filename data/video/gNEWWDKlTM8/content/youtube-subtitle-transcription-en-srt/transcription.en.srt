and my portal will be gone

634
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:27,120
and my portal will be gone
 

635
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,830
and my portal will be gone
and your portal still there

636
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:29,840
and your portal still there
 

637
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:35,590

right now we need the ball so we can get
 

671
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,110

up there if we want to go over there we
 

673
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,630

need a new ball
 

675
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,590

wait do you want to send the ball away
 

687
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,110
wait do you want to send the ball away
you can try sending the ball wait do it

688
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,120
you can try sending the ball wait do it
 

689
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,789

00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:30,549

on the other side dark blue

876
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:30,559

 

877
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,830

now the air is going to the laser

878
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:33,840
now the air is going to the laser
 

879
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:42,870
now the air is going to the laser
so how about

880
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:42,880

 

881
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,630

i think we're getting we're getting

882
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:44,640
i think we're getting we're getting
 

883
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,350
i think we're getting we're getting
closer kobo don't worry i know i know

884
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:49,360
closer kobo don't worry i know i know
 

885
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,909
closer kobo don't worry i know i know
because now the ball can

886
00:23:51,909 --> 00:23:51,919
because now the ball can
 

887
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,710
because now the ball can
flow over there just if we make that

888
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:54,720
flow over there just if we make that
 

889
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,510
flow over there just if we make that
last connection so now it's going for

02:43:08,550 --> 02:43:08,560
all right like let's see let's see the
 

6241
02:43:08,560 --> 02:43:10,150
all right like let's see let's see the
where's the cube

6242
02:43:10,150 --> 02:43:10,160
where's the cube
 

6243
02:43:10,160 --> 02:43:14,150
where's the cube
okay there oh okay there goes the cube

6244
02:43:14,150 --> 02:43:14,160
okay there oh okay there goes the cube
 

6245
02:43:14,160 --> 02:43:15,349

but wait
 

6247
02:43:15,359 --> 02:43:19,190
but wait
but when i already kept the cube so

6248
02:43:19,190 --> 02:43:19,200
but when i already kept the cube so
 

6249
02:43:19,200 --> 02:43:23,110
but when i already kept the cube so
where when i got the cube

6250
02:43:23,110 --> 02:43:23,120

 

6251
02:43:23,120 --> 02:43:25,990

after after you sense the cube i think

6252
02:43:25,990 --> 02:43:26,000
after after you sense the cube i think
 

6253
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:28,070
after after you sense the cube i think
you have to put one portal

6254
02:43:28,070 --> 02:43:28,080
you have to put one portal
 

6255
02:43:28,080 --> 02:43:30,790
you have to put one portal
the dark blue portal here

6256
02:43:30,790 --> 02:43:30,800
the dark blue portal here
 

6257
02:43:30,800 --> 02:43:33,429
the dark blue portal here
after i get the cube

6258
02:43:33,429 --> 02:43:33,439
after i get the cube
 

6259
02:43:33,439 --> 02:43:34,790
after i get the cube
is that

6260
02:43:34,790 --> 02:43:34,800
is that
 

6261
02:43:34,800 --> 02:43:38,950
is that
manageable is that too just too fast

6262
02:43:38,950 --> 02:43:38,960
manageable is that too just too fast
 

6263
02:43:38,960 --> 02:43:41,110
manageable is that too just too fast
let's try i guess

6264
02:43:41,110 --> 02:43:41,120
let's try i guess
 

6265
02:43:41,120 --> 02:43:43,750
let's try i guess
uh it sounds difficult well let's try

6266
02:43:43,750 --> 02:43:43,760
uh it sounds difficult well let's try
 

6267
02:43:43,760 --> 02:43:45,990
uh it sounds difficult well let's try

several cubes and if we want free cubes

7688
03:18:14,870 --> 03:18:14,880
several cubes and if we want free cubes
 

7689
03:18:14,880 --> 03:18:16,630
several cubes and if we want free cubes
and every cube needs to block one of

03:18:16,630 --> 03:18:16,640
and every cube needs to block one of
 

7691
03:18:16,640 --> 03:18:18,229
and every cube needs to block one of
these lasers

7692

these lasers
 

7693
03:18:18,239 --> 03:18:19,990

and see what changes when i put the cube
 

7723
03:18:48,720 --> 03:18:53,670
and see what changes when i put the cube
uh onto the laser okay
