00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:32,549
but I just left it behind.  That's
 

1438

2355
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:57,030

2362
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:12,510

think it's okay to throw it to the top, but it's a lot of odds, so it's going up, but there are a lot of options around here.  It's

2363
01:23:12,510 --> 01:23:16,350
think it's okay to throw it to the top, but it's a lot of odds, so it's going up, but there are a lot of options around here.  It's
 

2364
01:23:16,350 --> 01:23:16,360

 

2365
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:21,470

like adjusting the

2366
01:23:21,470 --> 01:23:21,480
like adjusting the
 

2367
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:24,510
like adjusting the
goal. It's nice, so it's the

2368
01:23:24,510 --> 01:23:24,520
goal. It's nice, so it's the
 

2369
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:26,590
goal. It's nice, so it's the
highest.

2370
01:23:26,590 --> 01:23:26,600
highest.
 

2371
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:30,030
highest.
That means the course will be different tomorrow as well.

2372
01:23:30,030 --> 01:23:30,040
That means the course will be different tomorrow as well.
 

2373
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:33,350
That means the course will be different tomorrow as well.
This is the final one, so I

2374
01:23:33,350 --> 01:23:33,360
This is the final one, so I
 

2375
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:35,629
This is the final one, so I
see. If you practice, it'll be as good as the actual one.

2376
01:23:35,629 --> 01:23:35,639
see. If you practice, it'll be as good as the actual one.
 

2377

[Applause] I feel
like it was easier to do things yesterday than yesterday,

2387
01:23:56,070 --> 01:23:56,080
like it was easier to do things yesterday than yesterday,
 

2388
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:58,750
like it was easier to do things yesterday than yesterday,
but

2389
01:23:58,750 --> 01:23:58,760
but
 

2390
01:23:58,760 --> 01:24:01,669
but
maybe it's just my imagination. It's a bit of a misunderstanding. If you'd

2391
01:24:01,669 --> 01:24:01,679
maybe it's just my imagination. It's a bit of a misunderstanding. If you'd
 

2392
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:03,550
maybe it's just my imagination. It's a bit of a misunderstanding. If you'd
like, let's practice together.

2393
01:24:03,550 --> 01:24:03,560
like, let's practice together.

Okay, let's practice. Let's get everyone
together. Next, we'll do the test once. After

2397
01:24:09,030 --> 01:24:09,040
together. Next, we'll do the test once. After
 

2398
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:12,030
together. Next, we'll do the test once. After
that, we'll be able to do it pretty freely. I

2399
01:24:12,030 --> 01:24:12,040
that, we'll be able to do it pretty freely. I
 

2400
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:16,270
that, we'll be able to do it pretty freely. I
think we should leave the voice server as it is.

and up
to 32,739 people can run.That's right,

2779
01:38:15,149 --> 01:38:15,159
to 32,739 people can run.That's right,
 

2780
01:38:15,159 --> 01:38:19,709
to 32,739 people can run.That's right,
if you limit the number of people to 9, the anchor person

2781
01:38:19,709 --> 01:38:19,719
if you limit the number of people to 9, the anchor person
 

2782
01:38:19,719 --> 01:38:23,229
if you limit the number of people to 9, the anchor person
will run one lap.

2783
01:38:23,229 --> 01:38:27,390

 

2784
01:38:27,390 --> 01:38:27,400

 

2785
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:32,390

If you're someone who wants to do it the next time because you can do it with a bang, then if you

2786
01:38:32,390 --> 01:38:32,400
If you're someone who wants to do it the next time because you can do it with a bang, then if you
 

2787
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:37,149
If you're someone who wants to do it the next time because you can do it with a bang, then if you
can't do it right now, why don't you just participate the second time and

2788
01:38:37,149 --> 01:38:37,159
can't do it right now, why don't you just participate the second time and
 

2789
01:38:37,159 --> 01:38:38,830
can't do it right now, why don't you just participate the second time and
do whatever you want?

2790
01:38:38,830 --> 01:38:38,840
do whatever you want?
 

2791
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:41,790
do whatever you want?
Or maybe the other teams aren't ready.There

2792
01:38:41,790 --> 01:38:41,800
Or maybe the other teams aren't ready.There
 

2793
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:45,310
Or maybe the other teams aren't ready.There
are some people who are acting violently, so we're not going to do it again

2794
01:38:45,310 --> 01:38:45,320
are some people who are acting violently, so we're not going to do it again
 

2795
01:38:45,320 --> 01:38:48,350
are some people who are acting violently, so we're not going to do it again
with the full members.That's

2796
01:38:48,350 --> 01:38:48,360
with the full members.That's
 

2797
01:38:48,360 --> 01:38:51,669
with the full members.That's
right, so if it's confusing, it's

2798
01:38:51,669 --> 01:38:51,679
right, so if it's confusing, it's
 

2799
01:38:51,679 --> 01:38:54,990
right, so if it's confusing, it's
okay to have a mess of teams.So

2800
01:38:54,990 --> 01:38:55,000
okay to have a mess of teams.So
 

2801
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:56,950
okay to have a mess of teams.So
how do we decide?  I see the team  I

2802
01:38:56,950 --> 01:39:00,990
how do we decide?  I see the team  I
 

2803
01:39:00,990 --> 01:39:03,870

 

2804
01:39:03,870 --> 01:39:03,880

 

2805
01:39:03,880 --> 01:39:06,950

What's up with Moshi-moshi? This is the one where you

2916
01:42:23,310 --> 01:42:23,320
What's up with Moshi-moshi? This is the one where you
 

2917
01:42:23,320 --> 01:42:28,430
What's up with Moshi-moshi? This is the one where you
can practice without using the system.

2918
01:42:28,430 --> 01:42:28,440
can practice without using the system.
 

2919
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:32,589
can practice without using the system.
So, without using the system, you

2920
01:42:32,589 --> 01:42:32,599
So, without using the system, you
 

2921
01:42:32,599 --> 01:42:35,229
So, without using the system, you
can practice freely without starting or anything.  I've already

2922
01:42:35,229 --> 01:42:35,239
can practice freely without starting or anything.  I've already
 

2923
01:42:35,239 --> 01:42:39,229
can practice freely without starting or anything.  I've already
received it, so those who use the system

2924
01:42:39,229 --> 01:42:39,239
received it, so those who use the system
 

2925
01:42:39,239 --> 01:42:41,189
received it, so those who use the system
have to do it one by one, so I

2926
01:42:41,189 --> 01:42:44,430
have to do it one by one, so I
 

2927
01:42:44,430 --> 01:42:44,440

 

2928
01:42:44,440 --> 01:42:47,270

guess I'll give them a command. Those who want to do it, oh, I see. Well

2929
01:42:47,270 --> 01:42:47,280
guess I'll give them a command. Those who want to do it, oh, I see. Well
 

2930
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:49,669
guess I'll give them a command. Those who want to do it, oh, I see. Well
then, yeah. For example, I'm going

2931
01:42:49,669 --> 01:42:49,679
then, yeah. For example, I'm going
 

2932
01:42:49,679 --> 01:42:52,070
then, yeah. For example, I'm going
to do Holomen Hunter one more time, so if you want to do it, please come.  It's

2933
01:42:52,070 --> 01:42:52,080
to do Holomen Hunter one more time, so if you want to do it, please come.  It's
 

2934
01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:54,510
to do Holomen Hunter one more time, so if you want to do it, please come.  It's
like, ``I want to sleep,'' and I say, ``If anyone wants to play, please come.''

2935
01:42:54,510 --> 01:42:54,520
like, ``I want to sleep,'' and I say, ``If anyone wants to play, please come.''
 

2936
01:42:54,520 --> 01:42:58,270
like, ``I want to sleep,'' and I say, ``If anyone wants to play, please come.''
I give the command, ``Hello, take the bread.'' I

2937
01:42:58,270 --> 01:42:58,280
I give the command, ``Hello, take the bread.'' I
 

2938
01:42:58,280 --> 01:43:00,910
I give the command, ``Hello, take the bread.'' I
had a question about this, so I'm going to share it.  You

2939
01:43:00,910 --> 01:43:03,750
had a question about this, so I'm going to share it.  You
 

2940
01:43:03,750 --> 01:43:03,760

 

2941
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:06,070

can also do a dash without taking the bread,

2942
01:43:06,070 --> 01:43:06,080
can also do a dash without taking the bread,
 

2943
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:09,470
can also do a dash without taking the bread,
but if you

2944
01:43:09,470 --> 01:43:09,480
but if you
 

2945
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:12,910
but if you
can do that, it will be quite slow, and it will be even slower.However, if you don't

2946
01:43:12,910 --> 01:43:15,589
can do that, it will be quite slow, and it will be even slower.However, if you don't
 

2947
01:43:15,589 --> 01:43:15,599

 

2948
01:43:15,599 --> 01:43:18,310

take the action of taking the bread, it will be faster.  It's

2949
01:43:18,310 --> 01:43:18,320
take the action of taking the bread, it will be faster.  It's
 

2950
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:21,229
take the action of taking the bread, it will be faster.  It's
also a matter of gender, but that's what I do.I

2951
01:43:21,229 --> 01:43:21,239
also a matter of gender, but that's what I do.I
 

2952

2954
01:43:24,080 --> 01:43:27,669
dash without taking the bread, so
taking the bread is a must, and as a rule, I have to make sure I

thought I'd share the rules,
 

2962
01:43:35,880 --> 01:43:41,390

02:19:03,080 --> 02:19:06,750
is not exactly the same in the first half.  After all  It's
random, so in reality, if you make red hair,

3999
02:19:06,750 --> 02:19:06,760
random, so in reality, if you make red hair,
 

4000
02:19:06,760 --> 02:19:08,950
random, so in reality, if you make red hair,
for example, there will be a lot of paprika,

4001
02:19:08,950 --> 02:19:08,960
for example, there will be a lot of paprika,
 

4002

02:19:14,509 --> 02:19:14,519
but I think that's true, but it's
 

4006
02:19:14,519 --> 02:19:17,910
but I think that's true, but it's
still random.  I do

4007
02:19:17,910 --> 02:19:17,920
still random.  I do
 

4008
02:19:17,920 --> 02:19:21,070

n't really get it, it seems like some

n't really get it, it seems like some
 

4010
02:19:21,080 --> 02:19:23,910
n't really get it, it seems like some
random guy is getting angry, and the

02:19:28,349 --> 02:19:28,359
topic for the day is random, but the
 

4014
02:19:28,359 --> 02:19:31,790
topic for the day is random, but the
one that's appearing now doesn't change, and there's a possibility that the same one will come out again.

4015
02:19:31,790 --> 02:19:35,230
one that's appearing now doesn't change, and there's a possibility that the same one will come out again.
