in the practice the original idea was
 

7713
03:35:54,779 --> 03:35:56,269
in the practice the original idea was
that we

7714
03:35:56,269 --> 03:35:56,279
that we
 

7715
03:35:56,279 --> 03:35:59,929
that we
um run all five together from one side

7716
03:35:59,929 --> 03:35:59,939
um run all five together from one side
 

7717
03:35:59,939 --> 03:36:03,370
um run all five together from one side
then to the other side

7718
03:36:03,370 --> 03:36:03,380
then to the other side
 

7719
03:36:03,380 --> 03:36:06,490
then to the other side
until here we run to one side and then

7720
03:36:06,490 --> 03:36:06,500
until here we run to one side and then
 

7721
03:36:06,500 --> 03:36:08,929
until here we run to one side and then
it repeats so we run to the other side

7722
03:36:08,929 --> 03:36:08,939
it repeats so we run to the other side
 

7723
03:36:08,939 --> 03:36:11,150
it repeats so we run to the other side
but then when we were like rehearsing we

7724
03:36:11,150 --> 03:36:11,160
but then when we were like rehearsing we
 

7725
03:36:11,160 --> 03:36:14,929
but then when we were like rehearsing we
realized that the studio is you know

7726
03:36:14,929 --> 03:36:14,939
realized that the studio is you know
 

7727
03:36:14,939 --> 03:36:18,290
realized that the studio is you know
quite wider than this place where we

7728
03:36:18,290 --> 03:36:18,300
quite wider than this place where we
 

7729
03:36:18,300 --> 03:36:21,170
quite wider than this place where we
practiced and that running from one side

7730
03:36:21,170 --> 03:36:21,180
practiced and that running from one side
 

7731
03:36:21,180 --> 03:36:25,190
practiced and that running from one side
to the other is gonna take a while so in

7732
03:36:25,190 --> 03:36:25,200
to the other is gonna take a while so in
 

7733
03:36:25,200 --> 03:36:29,410
to the other is gonna take a while so in
the rehearsal we decided to split it but

7734

we were most of the time we were
standing in the formation

7842
03:39:06,769 --> 03:39:06,779
standing in the formation
 

7843
03:39:06,779 --> 03:39:07,849
standing in the formation
um

7844
03:39:07,849 --> 03:39:07,859
um
 

7845
03:39:07,859 --> 03:39:09,710
um
you don't see it so well here but most

7846
03:39:09,710 --> 03:39:09,720
you don't see it so well here but most
 

7847
03:39:09,720 --> 03:39:12,349
you don't see it so well here but most
of the time we had three lines uh as the

03:39:12,349 --> 03:39:12,359
of the time we had three lines uh as the
 

7849
03:39:12,359 --> 03:39:13,490
of the time we had three lines uh as the

7850
03:39:13,490 --> 03:39:13,500
formation
 

7851
03:39:13,500 --> 03:39:18,110
formation
so front middle and back and then

7852
03:39:18,110 --> 03:39:18,120
so front middle and back and then
 

7853
03:39:18,120 --> 03:39:18,910
so front middle and back and then
um

7854
03:39:18,910 --> 03:39:18,920
um
 

7855
03:39:18,920 --> 03:39:21,290
um
in this case was like kind of behind me

7856
03:39:21,290 --> 03:39:21,300
in this case was like kind of behind me
 

7857
03:39:21,300 --> 03:39:23,510
in this case was like kind of behind me
so she saw me but I also had her in the

7858
03:39:23,510 --> 03:39:23,520
so she saw me but I also had her in the
 

7859
03:39:23,520 --> 03:39:24,889
so she saw me but I also had her in the
corner of my eye

7860
03:39:24,889 --> 03:39:24,899
corner of my eye
 

7861
03:39:24,899 --> 03:39:26,990
corner of my eye
so whenever we were in a formation like

7862
03:39:26,990 --> 03:39:27,000
so whenever we were in a formation like
 

7863
03:39:27,000 --> 03:39:30,050
so whenever we were in a formation like
this I feel like I was always

7864
03:39:30,050 --> 03:39:30,060
this I feel like I was always
 

7865
03:39:30,060 --> 03:39:33,050
this I feel like I was always
syncing up with the

7866
03:39:33,050 --> 03:39:33,060
syncing up with the
 

7867
03:39:33,060 --> 03:39:36,290
syncing up with the
person that was next to me

7868
03:39:36,290 --> 03:39:36,300
person that was next to me
 

7869
03:39:36,300 --> 03:39:38,150
person that was next to me
so sometimes that was Ina and sometimes

7870
03:39:38,150 --> 03:39:38,160
so sometimes that was Ina and sometimes
 

7871
03:39:38,160 --> 03:39:41,030
so sometimes that was Ina and sometimes
that was Ahmed and in this case you know

7872
03:39:41,030 --> 03:39:41,040
that was Ahmed and in this case you know
 

7873
03:39:41,040 --> 03:39:42,849
that was Ahmed and in this case you know
we do the spin

7874
03:39:42,849 --> 03:39:42,859
we do the spin
 

7875
03:39:42,859 --> 03:39:47,210
we do the spin
hand movement and it was from there on

7876
03:39:47,210 --> 03:39:47,220
hand movement and it was from there on
 

7877
03:39:47,220 --> 03:39:49,610
hand movement and it was from there on
it was a contest of who can lower their

7878
03:39:49,610 --> 03:39:49,620
it was a contest of who can lower their
 

7879
03:39:49,620 --> 03:39:52,910
it was a contest of who can lower their
hand the slowest

7880
03:39:52,910 --> 03:39:52,920
hand the slowest
 

7881
03:39:52,920 --> 03:39:56,269
hand the slowest
because uh Sensei was like you just do

7882
03:39:56,269 --> 03:39:56,279
because uh Sensei was like you just do
 

7883
03:39:56,279 --> 03:39:58,490
because uh Sensei was like you just do
this one movement and then just let your

7884
03:39:58,490 --> 03:39:58,500
this one movement and then just let your
 

7885
03:39:58,500 --> 03:40:00,889
this one movement and then just let your
hand go down really slowly and slowly as

7886
03:40:00,889 --> 03:40:00,899
hand go down really slowly and slowly as
 

7887
03:40:00,899 --> 03:40:03,229
hand go down really slowly and slowly as
possible you can do it as long as good

7888
03:40:03,229 --> 03:40:03,239
possible you can do it as long as good
 

7889
03:40:03,239 --> 03:40:04,849
possible you can do it as long as good
as singing

7890
03:40:04,849 --> 03:40:04,859
as singing
 

7891
03:40:04,859 --> 03:40:08,950
as singing
so it was always just like a contest

7892
03:40:08,950 --> 03:40:08,960
so it was always just like a contest
 

7893
03:40:08,960 --> 03:40:10,630
