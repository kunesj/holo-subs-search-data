i have the doors too by the way so i
 

2207
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,549
i have the doors too by the way so i
could like have an open door here and

2208
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:38,559
could like have an open door here and
 

2209
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:39,990
could like have an open door here and
one in the back too because apparently

2210
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:40,000
one in the back too because apparently
 

2211
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,670
one in the back too because apparently
there's a back door as well

there's a back door as well
 

2213
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:46,549
there's a back door as well
but in theory i could also maybe do this

2214
00:53:46,549 --> 00:53:46,559
but in theory i could also maybe do this
 

2215
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:49,589
but in theory i could also maybe do this
so then it would solve the problem at

2216
00:53:49,589 --> 00:53:49,599
so then it would solve the problem at
 

2217
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:51,190
so then it would solve the problem at
least a little bit

2631
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:49,829
yeah they got glitter in it so i wanted
to buy that but it would have taken too

2632
01:02:49,829 --> 01:02:49,839
to buy that but it would have taken too
 

2633
01:02:49,839 --> 01:02:51,670
to buy that but it would have taken too
long i think

2634
01:02:51,670 --> 01:02:51,680
long i think
 

2635
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:54,789
long i think
but if i had that then i could fill the

2636
01:02:54,789 --> 01:02:54,799
but if i had that then i could fill the
 

2637
01:02:54,799 --> 01:02:56,710
but if i had that then i could fill the
whole roof with that because if it's

2638
01:02:56,710 --> 01:02:56,720
whole roof with that because if it's
 

2639
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:58,470
whole roof with that because if it's
colored then it actually looks good i

2640
01:02:58,470 --> 01:02:58,480
colored then it actually looks good i
 

2641
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,829
colored then it actually looks good i
guess

2642
01:03:00,829 --> 01:03:00,839

a new season

5268
02:08:15,589 --> 02:08:15,599
a new season
 

5269
02:08:15,599 --> 02:08:18,229
a new season
i think

5270
02:08:18,229 --> 02:08:18,239

 

5271
02:08:18,239 --> 02:08:20,830

my show i don't have the dark red

5272
02:08:20,830 --> 02:08:20,840
my show i don't have the dark red
 

5273
02:08:20,840 --> 02:08:24,310
my show i don't have the dark red
anymore i have to go this bright red

5274
02:08:24,310 --> 02:08:24,320
anymore i have to go this bright red
 

5275
02:08:24,320 --> 02:08:26,709
anymore i have to go this bright red
so once the new season of the handmaid's

5276
02:08:26,709 --> 02:08:26,719
so once the new season of the handmaid's
 

5277
02:08:26,719 --> 02:08:29,030
so once the new season of the handmaid's
tale comes out i will watch the last

5278
02:08:29,030 --> 02:08:29,040
tale comes out i will watch the last
 

5279
02:08:29,040 --> 02:08:33,510
tale comes out i will watch the last
episode of the last season

5280
02:08:33,510 --> 02:08:33,520

 

5281
02:08:33,520 --> 02:08:35,430

5283
02:08:35,440 --> 02:08:37,750

02:08:37,750 --> 02:08:37,760
watching it and but it doesn't make
 

5285
02:08:37,760 --> 02:08:40,149
