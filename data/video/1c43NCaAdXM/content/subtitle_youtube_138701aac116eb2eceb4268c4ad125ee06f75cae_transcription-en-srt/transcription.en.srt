much all right then can we craft some
 

4652
02:16:07,360 --> 02:16:10,030
much all right then can we craft some
forged steel do we need more no we need

4653
02:16:10,030 --> 02:16:10,040
forged steel do we need more no we need
 

4654

workstation but I can make a cement
 

4678
02:16:48,280 --> 02:16:50,469
workstation but I can make a cement
mixer now which with that we could make

4679
02:16:50,469 --> 02:16:50,479
mixer now which with that we could make
 

4680
02:16:50,479 --> 02:16:51,549

fury but my next reward that I can uh
make is a chemistry station and then a

4687
02:16:58,910 --> 02:16:58,920
make is a chemistry station and then a
 

4688
02:16:58,920 --> 02:17:02,150
make is a chemistry station and then a
crucible so it's very far station's good

4689
02:17:02,150 --> 02:17:02,160
crucible so it's very far station's good
 

4690
02:17:02,160 --> 02:17:06,469
crucible so it's very far station's good
for me yeah it will be

4691
02:17:06,469 --> 02:17:06,479

 

4692
02:17:06,479 --> 02:17:11,990

4700
02:17:28,559 --> 02:17:34,549

okay car not enough steel so I

4701
02:17:34,549 --> 02:17:34,559
okay car not enough steel so I
 

4702
02:17:34,559 --> 02:17:38,830
okay car not enough steel so I
think I have to make a lower level

4703
02:17:38,830 --> 02:17:38,840
think I have to make a lower level
 

4704
02:17:38,840 --> 02:17:45,190
think I have to make a lower level
one which will be good

4705
02:17:45,190 --> 02:17:45,200

 

4706
02:17:45,200 --> 02:17:47,629

enough chemistry station will be great

4707
02:17:47,629 --> 02:17:47,639
enough chemistry station will be great
 

4708
02:17:47,639 --> 02:17:52,230
enough chemistry station will be great
to reduce material consumption okay

4709
02:17:52,230 --> 02:17:52,240
to reduce material consumption okay
 

4710
02:17:52,240 --> 02:17:54,030
to reduce material consumption okay

it so early in the game when wa I can't
even like I'm way too far from crafting

4723
02:18:09,990 --> 02:18:10,000
even like I'm way too far from crafting
 

4724
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:11,910
even like I'm way too far from crafting
it myself they probably want to balance

4725
02:18:11,910 --> 02:18:11,920
it myself they probably want to balance
 

4726
02:18:11,920 --> 02:18:15,509
it myself they probably want to balance
that out so that you don't get it too

4727
02:18:15,509 --> 02:18:15,519
that out so that you don't get it too
 

4728
02:18:15,519 --> 02:18:18,389
that out so that you don't get it too
early so yeah probably in the mountain

4729

early so yeah probably in the mountain
 

4730
02:18:18,399 --> 02:18:22,070
early so yeah probably in the mountain
area there's a chance

4731
02:18:22,070 --> 02:18:22,080
area there's a chance
 

4732

check Bobby more often I think we could
 

4736
02:18:28,840 --> 02:18:31,549
check Bobby more often I think we could
farm that much money easily it might be

4737
02:18:31,549 --> 02:18:31,559
farm that much money easily it might be
 

4738
02:18:31,559 --> 02:18:34,349
farm that much money easily it might be
worth it yeah yeah the the higher the

4739
02:18:34,349 --> 02:18:34,359
worth it yeah yeah the the higher the
 

4740
02:18:34,359 --> 02:18:37,629
worth it yeah yeah the the higher the
tier Quest the more like Quest if we

4741
02:18:37,629 --> 02:18:37,639
tier Quest the more like Quest if we
 

4742
02:18:37,639 --> 02:18:41,790
tier Quest the more like Quest if we
have start getting like 2K ah 2K now and

4743
02:18:41,790 --> 02:18:41,800
have start getting like 2K ah 2K now and
 

4744
02:18:41,800 --> 02:18:45,309
have start getting like 2K ah 2K now and
stuff so doing do we have more water

4745
02:18:45,309 --> 02:18:45,319
stuff so doing do we have more water

down to threee what's what's a solar
 

7012
03:21:54,680 --> 03:21:57,349
down to threee what's what's a solar
cell it must be for some other cool

7013
03:21:57,349 --> 03:21:57,359
cell it must be for some other cool
 

7014
03:21:57,359 --> 03:21:59,870
cell it must be for some other cool
machine but I have yet to find what it's

7015
03:21:59,870 --> 03:21:59,880
machine but I have yet to find what it's
 

7016
03:21:59,880 --> 03:22:02,189
machine but I have yet to find what it's
useful for yeah I guess you can get

7017
03:22:02,189 --> 03:22:02,199
useful for yeah I guess you can get
 

7018
03:22:02,199 --> 03:22:03,870
useful for yeah I guess you can get
power but I don't know what it's used

7019
03:22:03,870 --> 03:22:03,880
power but I don't know what it's used
