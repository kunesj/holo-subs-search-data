I have a problem nobody can walk through

2464
01:08:42,650 --> 01:08:42,660

until that dude is killed

2466
01:08:45,590 --> 01:08:45,600
until that dude is killed
 

2467
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:48,590
until that dude is killed
she could kill him

2468
01:08:48,590 --> 01:08:48,600
she could kill him
 

2469
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:51,769
she could kill him
Kiara actually could not

2470
01:08:51,769 --> 01:08:51,779
Kiara actually could not
 

2471
01:08:51,779 --> 01:08:53,630
Kiara actually could not
um and I think that's she will have to

2472
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:53,640
um and I think that's she will have to
 

2473
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:55,370
um and I think that's she will have to
kill him because Celine would have to

2474
01:08:55,370 --> 01:08:55,380
kill him because Celine would have to
 

2475
01:08:55,380 --> 01:08:56,930
kill him because Celine would have to
kill him because even if Kiara kills him

2476
01:08:56,930 --> 01:08:56,940
kill him because even if Kiara kills him
 

2477
01:08:56,940 --> 01:08:59,809
kill him because even if Kiara kills him

hey

8692
03:49:33,530 --> 03:49:33,540
hey
 

8693
03:49:33,540 --> 03:49:36,170
hey
so I've I've been thinking about it even

8694
03:49:36,170 --> 03:49:36,180
so I've I've been thinking about it even
 

8695
03:49:36,180 --> 03:49:37,729
so I've I've been thinking about it even
though it wasn't obvious to me at first

8696
03:49:37,729 --> 03:49:37,739
though it wasn't obvious to me at first
 

8697
03:49:37,739 --> 03:49:40,070
though it wasn't obvious to me at first
but I'm guessing that she's the one who

8698
03:49:40,070 --> 03:49:40,080
but I'm guessing that she's the one who
 

8699
03:49:40,080 --> 03:49:43,670
but I'm guessing that she's the one who
was hooded before but don't tell me

8700
03:49:43,670 --> 03:49:43,680
was hooded before but don't tell me
 

8701
03:49:43,680 --> 03:49:46,190
was hooded before but don't tell me
but because it's because she's kind of

8702
03:49:46,190 --> 03:49:46,200
but because it's because she's kind of
 

8703
03:49:46,200 --> 03:49:49,670
but because it's because she's kind of
small and she's Barefoot you're the girl

8704
03:49:49,670 --> 03:49:49,680
small and she's Barefoot you're the girl

five times

14744
06:28:25,250 --> 06:28:25,260
five times
 

14745
06:28:25,260 --> 06:28:27,770
five times
10 is 15.

14746
06:28:27,770 --> 06:28:27,780
10 is 15.
 

14747
06:28:27,780 --> 06:28:32,570
10 is 15.
so five times twenty is hundred

14748
06:28:32,570 --> 06:28:32,580
so five times twenty is hundred
 

14749
06:28:32,580 --> 06:28:34,910
so five times twenty is hundred
and then

14750
06:28:34,910 --> 06:28:34,920
and then
 

14751
06:28:34,920 --> 06:28:38,330

06:30:06,480 --> 06:30:08,390
it's called tsuba in Japanese I guess
but

14820
06:30:08,390 --> 06:30:08,400
but
 

14821
06:30:08,400 --> 06:30:12,350
but
yeah it wasn't even strongly poking it

14822
06:30:12,350 --> 06:30:12,360
yeah it wasn't even strongly poking it
 

14823
06:30:12,360 --> 06:30:14,570
yeah it wasn't even strongly poking it
was just really lightly poking and that

14824
06:30:14,570 --> 06:30:14,580
was just really lightly poking and that
 

14825
06:30:14,580 --> 06:30:16,190
was just really lightly poking and that
happened before I think I told you about

06:30:16,190 --> 06:30:16,200
happened before I think I told you about
 

14827
06:30:16,200 --> 06:30:20,048
happened before I think I told you about
before and then this time it seems like

14828
06:30:20,048 --> 06:30:20,058
before and then this time it seems like
 

14829
06:30:20,058 --> 06:30:25,010
before and then this time it seems like

think like he would was a dude it was
kind of like first funny and nice in the

14838
06:30:36,170 --> 06:30:36,180
kind of like first funny and nice in the
 

14839
06:30:36,180 --> 06:30:37,548
kind of like first funny and nice in the
beginning but then

14840
06:30:37,548 --> 06:30:37,558
beginning but then
 

14841
06:30:37,558 --> 06:30:41,570
beginning but then
it got just it was it was weird like I

14842

thought maybe he would do it for 10

14844
06:30:43,190 --> 06:30:43,200
thought maybe he would do it for 10
 

14845
06:30:43,200 --> 06:30:45,948
thought maybe he would do it for 10
minutes and then I I thought okay 10

14846
06:30:45,948 --> 06:30:45,958
minutes and then I I thought okay 10
 

14847
06:30:45,958 --> 06:30:47,628
minutes and then I I thought okay 10
minutes I can tolerate of this stupid

14848
06:30:47,628 --> 06:30:47,638
minutes I can tolerate of this stupid
 

14849
06:30:47,638 --> 06:30:49,010
minutes I can tolerate of this stupid
[\h__\h]

14850
06:30:49,010 --> 06:30:49,020
[\h__\h]
 

14851
06:30:49,020 --> 06:30:50,628
[\h__\h]
but

14852
06:30:50,628 --> 06:30:50,638
but
 

14853
06:30:50,638 --> 06:30:54,530
but
um so he would poke not even poke that

14854
06:30:54,530 --> 06:30:54,540
um so he would poke not even poke that
 

14855
06:30:54,540 --> 06:30:56,448
um so he would poke not even poke that
didn't even feel like poking he would

14856
06:30:56,448 --> 06:30:56,458
didn't even feel like poking he would
 

14857
06:30:56,458 --> 06:31:02,090
didn't even feel like poking he would
just lay a finger on top of for example

14858
06:31:02,090 --> 06:31:02,100
just lay a finger on top of for example
 

14859
06:31:02,100 --> 06:31:06,010
just lay a finger on top of for example
um between my thumb and my

14860
06:31:06,010 --> 06:31:06,020
um between my thumb and my
 

14861
06:31:06,020 --> 06:31:10,430
um between my thumb and my
uh the the UV next to it there's just

14862
06:31:10,430 --> 06:31:10,440
uh the the UV next to it there's just
 

14863
06:31:10,440 --> 06:31:13,430
uh the the UV next to it there's just
like you know that space there

14864
06:31:13,430 --> 06:31:13,440
like you know that space there
 

14865
06:31:13,440 --> 06:31:16,070
like you know that space there
and angle

14866
06:31:16,070 --> 06:31:16,080
and angle
 

14867
06:31:16,080 --> 06:31:18,170
and angle
so he would put a finger there

14868
06:31:18,170 --> 06:31:18,180
so he would put a finger there
 

14869
06:31:18,180 --> 06:31:23,690
so he would put a finger there
and maybe a finger on a hip

14870
06:31:23,690 --> 06:31:23,700

 

14871
06:31:23,700 --> 06:31:28,430
