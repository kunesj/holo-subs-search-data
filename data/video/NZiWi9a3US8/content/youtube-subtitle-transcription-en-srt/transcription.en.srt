yeah I think as a streamer I might be

10022
05:56:42,708 --> 05:56:42,718
yeah I think as a streamer I might be
 

10023
05:56:42,718 --> 05:56:45,150
yeah I think as a streamer I might be
slower than you guys though because of

10024
05:56:45,150 --> 05:56:45,160
slower than you guys though because of
 

10025
05:56:45,160 --> 05:56:47,030
slower than you guys though because of
the voice acting and also because I

10026
05:56:47,030 --> 05:56:47,040
the voice acting and also because I
 

10027
05:56:47,040 --> 05:56:49,190
the voice acting and also because I
think if you if you don't stream then

10028
05:56:49,190 --> 05:56:49,200
think if you if you don't stream then
 

10029
05:56:49,200 --> 05:56:52,190
think if you if you don't stream then
you definitely like go for all the text
