00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:05,870

 

859
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:05,880

 

860
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,570

think Chiara had released about 3 Oricab songs at that time, but I decided to

861
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:08,580
think Chiara had released about 3 Oricab songs at that time, but I decided to
 

862
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:12,370
think Chiara had released about 3 Oricab songs at that time, but I decided to
leave this one alone for a while.

863
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:12,380
leave this one alone for a while.
 

864
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:15,169
leave this one alone for a while.
If that were the case, it would definitely be a

865
00:33:15,169 --> 00:33:15,179
If that were the case, it would definitely be a
 

866
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:18,430
If that were the case, it would definitely be a
blast.  I

867
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:21,889

 

868
00:33:21,889 --> 00:33:21,899

 

869
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:23,870

thought that I wanted people to see the cool side of me, so I

870
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:23,880
thought that I wanted people to see the cool side of me, so I
 

871
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,509
thought that I wanted people to see the cool side of me, so I
decided to leave it alone and

872
00:33:26,509 --> 00:33:26,519
decided to leave it alone and
 

873
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:30,370
decided to leave it alone and
later realized that it was a good idea to leave it alone.  We

874
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:30,380
later realized that it was a good idea to leave it alone.  We
 

875
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:35,529
later realized that it was a good idea to leave it alone.  We
were talking about shirts earlier,

876
00:33:35,529 --> 00:33:35,539
were talking about shirts earlier,
 

877
00:33:35,539 --> 00:33:39,649
were talking about shirts earlier,
and I've been to a lot of idol concerts before,

878
00:33:39,649 --> 00:33:39,659
and I've been to a lot of idol concerts before,
 

879
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:44,690
and I've been to a lot of idol concerts before,
so towards the end of the concert,

880
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,190
so towards the end of the concert,
 

881
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:46,200

 

882
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,190

everyone wears shirts, and everyone

883
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:49,200
everyone wears shirts, and everyone
 

884
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,529
everyone wears shirts, and everyone
wears shirts, and it just feels

885
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:51,539
wears shirts, and it just feels
 

886
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:55,549
wears shirts, and it just feels
like a concert.  I've been saying a lot of things

887
00:33:55,549 --> 00:33:55,559
like a concert.  I've been saying a lot of things
 

888
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:59,870
like a concert.  I've been saying a lot of things
like that, so it's understandable. It

889
00:33:59,870 --> 00:33:59,880

 

890
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,669

was really good, and

891
00:34:01,669 --> 00:34:01,679
was really good, and
 

892
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,029
was really good, and
then the stage. Now, when I

893
00:34:04,029 --> 00:34:06,549
then the stage. Now, when I
 

894
00:34:06,549 --> 00:34:06,559

 

895
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:10,750

look back at the video that I appeared in, I

896
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:10,760
look back at the video that I appeared in, I
 

897
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:17,770
look back at the video that I appeared in, I
wonder how it turned out.  I do

898
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:17,780

 

899
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:20,690

n't know how they do it,

900
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:20,700
n't know how they do it,
 

901
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:25,010
n't know how they do it,
but is

902
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:25,020

 

903
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,990

n't it amazing? I don't know, but I've been dancing with a positive attitude all the time, so it's

904
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:29,530
n't it amazing? I don't know, but I've been dancing with a positive attitude all the time, so it's
 

905
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:29,540

 

906
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:35,050

true that it's completely AR and it's a live band. It's

907
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:35,060
true that it's completely AR and it's a live band. It's
 

908
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:40,849
true that it's completely AR and it's a live band. It's
amazing, isn't it? No, it's a

909
00:34:40,849 --> 00:34:40,859

 

910
00:34:40,859 --> 00:34:44,149

whole live show that has its true value year after year.

911
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:44,159
whole live show that has its true value year after year.
 

912
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,730
whole live show that has its true value year after year.
But what about the force?  I'm sure it's going to

913
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:49,030
But what about the force?  I'm sure it's going to
 

914
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:52,310

 

915
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:52,320

 

916
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,570

turn out well,

917
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:53,580
turn out well,
 

918
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:57,829
turn out well,
but I don't know if it's okay to really hype it up.The third part was amazing, so I wonder

919
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:57,839

 

920
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,450

if I can have high hopes for it.Let's look

if I can have high hopes for it.Let's look
forward to it, I wonder how it will turn out.  The

923
00:35:02,329 --> 00:35:02,339
forward to it, I wonder how it will turn out.  The
 

924
00:35:02,339 --> 00:35:03,550

925
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:03,560

 

926
