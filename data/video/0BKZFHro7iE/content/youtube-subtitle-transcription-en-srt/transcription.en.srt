yeah women also have testosterone it's a
 

2201
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:07,549
yeah women also have testosterone it's a
lesser amount yeah and that's why when

2202
00:52:07,549 --> 00:52:07,559
lesser amount yeah and that's why when
 

2203
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:10,430
lesser amount yeah and that's why when
you get hormonal acne it's often like on

2204
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:10,440

balm that's supposed to help with that

3383
01:18:19,370 --> 01:18:19,380

3384
01:18:19,380 --> 01:18:20,990

it makes it worse lip balm makes it

3385
01:18:20,990 --> 01:18:21,000
it makes it worse lip balm makes it
 

3386
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:25,070

3388
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:29,709
worse for me really yeah I try to
remember to put Vaseline on at night

3389
01:18:29,709 --> 01:18:29,719

 

3390
01:18:29,719 --> 01:18:34,189

I still bite I still rip rip and tear I

3391
01:18:34,189 --> 01:18:34,199
I still bite I still rip rip and tear I
 

3392
01:18:34,199 --> 01:18:35,090
I still bite I still rip rip and tear I
think

3393
01:18:35,090 --> 01:18:35,100
think
 

3394
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:37,430
think
so if you bite then your lips already

3395
01:18:37,430 --> 01:18:37,440
so if you bite then your lips already
 

3396
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:39,350
so if you bite then your lips already
have probably a red color and you don't

3397
01:18:39,350 --> 01:18:39,360
have probably a red color and you don't
 

3398
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:42,470
have probably a red color and you don't
need the lip tint

3399
01:18:42,470 --> 01:18:42,480

 

3400
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:46,570

enough

3401
01:18:46,570 --> 01:18:46,580

 

3402
01:18:46,580 --> 01:18:49,310

but even but even if you don't like make

3403
01:18:49,310 --> 01:18:49,320
but even but even if you don't like make
 

3404
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:51,770
but even but even if you don't like make
it go so far that it bleeds

3405
01:18:51,770 --> 01:18:51,780
it go so far that it bleeds
 

3406
01:18:51,780 --> 01:18:53,990
it go so far that it bleeds
um I think I saw girls do that before

growth so you go once and then you can't

4435
01:42:13,250 --> 01:42:13,260
growth so you go once and then you can't
 

4436
01:42:13,260 --> 01:42:15,709
growth so you go once and then you can't
just go the next day to do more because

4437
01:42:15,709 --> 01:42:15,719
just go the next day to do more because
 

4438
01:42:15,719 --> 01:42:17,390
just go the next day to do more because
they take some time until the next one

4439
01:42:17,390 --> 01:42:17,400
they take some time until the next one
 

4440
01:42:17,400 --> 01:42:19,669
they take some time until the next one
show up but you go once and gets rid of

4441
01:42:19,669 --> 01:42:19,679
show up but you go once and gets rid of
 

4442
01:42:19,679 --> 01:42:22,729
show up but you go once and gets rid of
rid of some of them forever forever

4443
01:42:22,729 --> 01:42:22,739
rid of some of them forever forever
 

4444
01:42:22,739 --> 01:42:25,310
rid of some of them forever forever
though and unlike laser which comes back

4445
01:42:25,310 --> 01:42:25,320
though and unlike laser which comes back
 

4446
01:42:25,320 --> 01:42:28,010
though and unlike laser which comes back
after a few months I think and then I

4447
01:42:28,010 --> 01:42:28,020
after a few months I think and then I
 

4448
01:42:28,020 --> 01:42:29,870
after a few months I think and then I
think laser is also supposed to be

4449
01:42:29,870 --> 01:42:29,880
think laser is also supposed to be
 

4450
01:42:29,880 --> 01:42:31,729
think laser is also supposed to be
forever no no there's two different

01:42:31,729 --> 01:42:31,739
forever no no there's two different
 

4452
01:42:31,739 --> 01:42:34,189
forever no no there's two different
types there's two different types it's

4453
01:42:34,189 --> 01:42:34,199
types there's two different types it's
 

4454
01:42:34,199 --> 01:42:36,470
types there's two different types it's
the ones that where it stays away for a

the ones that where it stays away for a
 

4456
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:38,450
the ones that where it stays away for a
long time but then there's the one

4457
01:42:38,450 --> 01:42:38,460
long time but then there's the one
 

4458
01:42:38,460 --> 01:42:40,669
long time but then there's the one
that's more expensive that is gone

4459
01:42:40,669 --> 01:42:40,679
that's more expensive that is gone
 

4460
01:42:40,679 --> 01:42:42,830
that's more expensive that is gone
forever and I did that one but it hurts
