the tripod you know what i'm saying so
 

587
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,270
the tripod you know what i'm saying so
it's like three pieces and

588
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:25,280
it's like three pieces and
 

589
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,150
it's like three pieces and
uh

590
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:26,160
uh
 

591
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,070
uh
three pieces that come together but most

592
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:28,080
three pieces that come together but most
 

593
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,270
three pieces that come together but most
of them just don't come together so

594
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:31,280
of them just don't come together so
 

595
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,909
of them just don't come together so
i just ended up putting it together with

596
00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:33,919
i just ended up putting it together with
 

597
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:34,950
i just ended up putting it together with
uh

598
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:34,960
uh
 

599
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,710

603
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,470

so

604
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:42,480
so
 

605
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,789

i i don't really like i don't mind
getting like a proper camera but then

608
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:46,480
getting like a proper camera but then
 

609
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,310
getting like a proper camera but then
i'll actually have to like look into it

610
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:48,320
i'll actually have to like look into it
 

611
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,230
i'll actually have to like look into it
and um

612
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:50,240
and um
 

613
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,549
and um
isn't it kind of overkill to use like a

614
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:52,559
isn't it kind of overkill to use like a
 

615
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,710
isn't it kind of overkill to use like a
like a speaker flex camera what was it

616
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:54,720
like a speaker flex camera what was it
 

617
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,630
like a speaker flex camera what was it
again uh

618
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:56,640
again uh
 

619
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,390
again uh

go
i feel like it's not necessary i could

630
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:14,799
i feel like it's not necessary i could
 

631
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,870
i feel like it's not necessary i could
use like a

632
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:16,880
use like a
 

633
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,549
use like a
webcam or a phone camera but with the

634
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:18,559
webcam or a phone camera but with the
 

635

637
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,470
phone it's like i'm using the phone i'm
using it

638
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:22,480
using it
 

639
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,470
using it
i could use my my tablets but they're

640
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:24,480
i could use my my tablets but they're
 

641
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,390
i could use my my tablets but they're
huge i don't want this huge screen in

642
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:26,400
huge i don't want this huge screen in
 

643
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,590

the way of me taking space up

644
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:29,600
the way of me taking space up
 

645
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,470
the way of me taking space up
so that's not an option for me either

646
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:32,480
so that's not an option for me either
 

647
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,310
so that's not an option for me either
it's kind of overkill like i wouldn't

648
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:34,320
it's kind of overkill like i wouldn't
 

649
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,909
it's kind of overkill like i wouldn't
really be using it besides for my

650
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:35,919
really be using it besides for my
 

651
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:36,680
really be using it besides for my

the new tripod because i'm sure it won't
 

667
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,270
the new tripod because i'm sure it won't
be able to

668
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:05,280
be able to
 

669
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,909

that

674
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:10,880
that
 

675
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,510
that
more tape tape is the way to go

676
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:13,520
more tape tape is the way to go
 

677
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,270
more tape tape is the way to go
um

678
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:15,280
um
 

679
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,390

i was i
 

681
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,070
i was i
i was also not sure if i really should

00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:18,080
i was also not sure if i really should
 

683
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,830
i was also not sure if i really should
buy the tripod because i wasn't sure if

684
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:19,840
buy the tripod because i wasn't sure if
 

685
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,430
buy the tripod because i wasn't sure if
that really is going to work the way i

686
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:21,440
that really is going to work the way i
 

687
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,710
that really is going to work the way i
need it to work

688
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:22,720
need it to work
 

689
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,430
need it to work
like

690
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:23,440
like
 

691
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,430
like
because like these these these tripods

692
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:27,440
because like these these these tripods
 

693
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,029
because like these these these tripods
they go like

694
00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:29,039
they go like
 

695
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,110
they go like
you make them tall but they have these

696
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:31,120
you make them tall but they have these
 

697
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,350
you make them tall but they have these
huge legs on the bottom that take up so

698
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:33,360
huge legs on the bottom that take up so
 

699
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,430
huge legs on the bottom that take up so
much space too

700
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:35,440
much space too
 

701
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,230
much space too
and i think i've thought about how to

702
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:38,240
and i think i've thought about how to
 

703
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,390
and i think i've thought about how to
position everything with that tripod and

704
