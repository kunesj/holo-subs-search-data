00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:12,799
sharp s and
 

699
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,830
sharp s and
if you can't write it you would write it

700
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:15,840
if you can't write it you would write it
 

701
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,789
if you can't write it you would write it
out because you have a different

702
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:16,799
out because you have a different
 

703
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,149
out because you have a different
keyboard or something or some people

704
00:20:18,149 --> 00:20:18,159
keyboard or something or some people
 

705
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,990
keyboard or something or some people
just do it for fun some people um

706
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:20,000
just do it for fun some people um
 

707
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,149
just do it for fun some people um
are too stupid to figure out at what

708
00:20:22,149 --> 00:20:22,159
are too stupid to figure out at what
 

709
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,270
are too stupid to figure out at what
even german people

710
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:23,280
even german people
 

711
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,950
even german people
some people just don't know when to use

712
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:24,960
some people just don't know when to use
 

713
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,549
some people just don't know when to use
the sharp s

714
00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:26,559
the sharp s
 

715
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:31,270
the sharp s
so they would uh just write double s

716
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:31,280
so they would uh just write double s
 

717
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,549
so they would uh just write double s
and you know there's words which have

718
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:34,559
and you know there's words which have
 

719
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,549
and you know there's words which have
double s in it for example like essen

720
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:36,559
double s in it for example like essen
 

721
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,390
double s in it for example like essen
which means eat

722
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:38,400
which means eat
 

723
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,430
which means eat
is it too much information asm which

724
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:41,440
is it too much information asm which
 

725
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,549
is it too much information asm which
means eat

726
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:42,559
means eat
 

727
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,510
means eat
but just because you have two s in it

728
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:45,520
but just because you have two s in it
 

729
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,510
but just because you have two s in it
doesn't mean that you would normally put

730
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:47,520
doesn't mean that you would normally put
 

731
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,070
doesn't mean that you would normally put
a shaft

732
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:48,080
a shaft
 

733
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,470
a shaft
s in it no no no no no no no no no no

say where would you where you put in the
shaft is s

740
00:20:59,430 --> 00:20:59,440
shaft is s
 

741
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,549
shaft is s
for example uh

742
00:21:02,549 --> 00:21:02,559
for example uh
 

743
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:16,070
for example uh
but anything else

744
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:16,080
