01:53:19,400 --> 01:53:20,990
because I just wanted to do anything
really I thought let's give it another

4050
01:53:20,990 --> 01:53:21,000
really I thought let's give it another
 

4051
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:25,310
really I thought let's give it another
try it was the same

4052
01:53:25,310 --> 01:53:25,320
try it was the same
 

4053
01:53:25,320 --> 01:53:27,750
try it was the same
instructor and it was the same kind of

4054
01:53:27,750 --> 01:53:27,760
instructor and it was the same kind of
 

4055
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:30,589
instructor and it was the same kind of
routine but I feel like the yapping the

4056
01:53:30,589 --> 01:53:30,599
routine but I feel like the yapping the
 

4057
01:53:30,599 --> 01:53:32,589
routine but I feel like the yapping the
spiritual yapping was a little bit more

4058
01:53:32,589 --> 01:53:32,599
spiritual yapping was a little bit more
 

4059
01:53:32,599 --> 01:53:36,430
spiritual yapping was a little bit more
toned down this time but also it was so

4060
01:53:36,430 --> 01:53:36,440
toned down this time but also it was so
 

4061
01:53:36,440 --> 01:53:39,589
toned down this time but also it was so
exhausting and I thought this is how it

4062
01:53:39,589 --> 01:53:39,599
exhausting and I thought this is how it
 

4063
01:53:39,599 --> 01:53:42,030
exhausting and I thought this is how it
is but my sister told me afterwards that

4064
01:53:42,030 --> 01:53:42,040
is but my sister told me afterwards that
 

4065
01:53:42,040 --> 01:53:45,350
is but my sister told me afterwards that
no this was a really intense and fast

4066
01:53:45,350 --> 01:53:45,360
no this was a really intense and fast
 

4067
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:47,470
no this was a really intense and fast
yoga session that felt more like a

4068
01:53:47,470 --> 01:53:47,480
yoga session that felt more like a
 

4069
01:53:47,480 --> 01:53:50,430
yoga session that felt more like a
workout than a yoga session I'm thinking

4070
01:53:50,430 --> 01:53:50,440
workout than a yoga session I'm thinking
 

4071
01:53:50,440 --> 01:53:52,430
workout than a yoga session I'm thinking
the instructor probably just wanted to

4072
01:53:52,430 --> 01:53:52,440
the instructor probably just wanted to
 

4073
01:53:52,440 --> 01:53:56,950
the instructor probably just wanted to
to pack as much volume into the one

4074
01:53:56,950 --> 01:53:56,960
to pack as much volume into the one
 

4075
01:53:56,960 --> 01:53:59,350
to pack as much volume into the one
session as possible so that it's you

4076
01:53:59,350 --> 01:53:59,360

problem
but it barely became weaker that was the

4292
01:59:07,149 --> 01:59:07,159
but it barely became weaker that was the
 

4293

but it barely became weaker that was the
issue but I was like worried about I I

4294
01:59:11,390 --> 01:59:11,400
issue but I was like worried about I I
 

4295
01:59:11,400 --> 01:59:12,990
issue but I was like worried about I I
felt awkward about saying it again and

felt awkward about saying it again and
 

4297
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,750

fiber mialgia is just placeholder but

6826
03:09:08,630 --> 03:09:08,640
fiber mialgia is just placeholder but
 

6827
03:09:08,640 --> 03:09:11,070
fiber mialgia is just placeholder but
with something like that I think the

6828
03:09:11,070 --> 03:09:11,080
with something like that I think the
 

6829
03:09:11,080 --> 03:09:14,870
with something like that I think the
moment you bring it up a doctor will

6830
03:09:14,870 --> 03:09:14,880
moment you bring it up a doctor will
 

6831
03:09:14,880 --> 03:09:16,429
moment you bring it up a doctor will
like high chances are they they just

6832
03:09:16,429 --> 03:09:16,439
like high chances are they they just
 

6833
03:09:16,439 --> 03:09:18,750
like high chances are they they just
stop taking you serious

6834
03:09:18,750 --> 03:09:18,760
stop taking you serious
 

6835
03:09:18,760 --> 03:09:21,550
stop taking you serious
seriously because fiber mialgia is like

6836
03:09:21,550 --> 03:09:21,560
seriously because fiber mialgia is like
 

6837
03:09:21,560 --> 03:09:25,150
seriously because fiber mialgia is like
something that's just it feels like you

6838
03:09:25,150 --> 03:09:25,160
something that's just it feels like you
 

6839
03:09:25,160 --> 03:09:28,110
something that's just it feels like you
can't pinpoint what this person has it's

6840
03:09:28,110 --> 03:09:28,120
can't pinpoint what this person has it's
 

6841
03:09:28,120 --> 03:09:30,110
can't pinpoint what this person has it's
probably somebody who's complaining

6842
03:09:30,110 --> 03:09:30,120
probably somebody who's complaining
 

6843
03:09:30,120 --> 03:09:35,150
probably somebody who's complaining
about pain that you can't tag to any

6844
03:09:35,150 --> 03:09:35,160
about pain that you can't tag to any
 

6845
03:09:35,160 --> 03:09:37,630
about pain that you can't tag to any
particular illness

6846
03:09:37,630 --> 03:09:37,640
particular illness
 

6847
03:09:37,640 --> 03:09:40,349
particular illness
and just

6848
03:09:40,349 --> 03:09:40,359
and just
 

6849
03:09:40,359 --> 03:09:44,990
and just
it I don't know it

6850
03:09:44,990 --> 03:09:45,000

 

6851
03:09:45,000 --> 03:09:48,190

yeah hard to find the solution most of

6852
03:09:48,190 --> 03:09:48,200
yeah hard to find the solution most of
 

6853
03:09:48,200 --> 03:09:49,830
yeah hard to find the solution most of
the people who have fiber probably went

6854
03:09:49,830 --> 03:09:49,840
the people who have fiber probably went
 

6855
03:09:49,840 --> 03:09:54,830
the people who have fiber probably went
to a lot of doctors

6856

fast I think as a viewer it doesn't feel
as overwhelming of course because you

8028
03:42:30,790 --> 03:42:30,800
as overwhelming of course because you

as overwhelming of course because you
just watching a 1 hour thing but for us

Vander Walt
 

8145
03:45:28,720 --> 03:45:31,830
Vander Walt
Walt uh right so he was like really

8146
03:45:31,830 --> 03:45:31,840

Walt uh right so he was like really
hesitant and all that and then the whole

8148
03:45:35,269 --> 03:45:35,279
hesitant and all that and then the whole
 

8149
03:45:35,279 --> 03:45:37,750
hesitant and all that and then the whole
reason why all that [\h__\h] went down is

8150
03:45:37,750 --> 03:45:37,760
reason why all that [\h__\h] went down is
 

8151
03:45:37,760 --> 03:45:40,830
reason why all that [\h__\h] went down is
because Walt got really

8152
03:45:40,830 --> 03:45:40,840
because Walt got really
 

8153
03:45:40,840 --> 03:45:45,910
because Walt got really
uh paranoid right but

8154
03:45:45,910 --> 03:45:45,920
uh paranoid right but
 

8155
03:45:45,920 --> 03:45:47,630
uh paranoid right but
I

8156
03:45:47,630 --> 03:45:47,640
I
 

8157
03:45:47,640 --> 03:45:50,229
I
think even though there was reason to be

8158
03:45:50,229 --> 03:45:50,239
think even though there was reason to be
 

8159
03:45:50,239 --> 03:45:52,349
think even though there was reason to be
paranoid from the POV of like Gus

8160
03:45:52,349 --> 03:45:52,359
paranoid from the POV of like Gus
 

8161

paranoid from the POV of like Gus
wanting to get rid of both I think Gail

8162
03:45:56,030 --> 03:45:56,040
wanting to get rid of both I think Gail
 

8163
03:45:56,040 --> 03:45:58,590
wanting to get rid of both I think Gail
when they were in the lab and Gail was

8164
03:45:58,590 --> 03:45:58,600
when they were in the lab and Gail was
 

8165
03:45:58,600 --> 03:46:01,670
when they were in the lab and Gail was
asking some questions those questions I

8166
03:46:01,670 --> 03:46:01,680
asking some questions those questions I
 

8167
03:46:01,680 --> 03:46:04,429
asking some questions those questions I
think were not because Gail was really

8168
03:46:04,429 --> 03:46:04,439
think were not because Gail was really
 

8169
03:46:04,439 --> 03:46:07,229
think were not because Gail was really
trying to quickly get gain the skills to

8170
03:46:07,229 --> 03:46:07,239
trying to quickly get gain the skills to
 

8171
03:46:07,239 --> 03:46:09,950
trying to quickly get gain the skills to
take over for Gus I think was what was

8172
03:46:09,950 --> 03:46:09,960
take over for Gus I think was what was
 

8173
03:46:09,960 --> 03:46:12,429
take over for Gus I think was what was
going on in Gail's mind was because he

8174
03:46:12,429 --> 03:46:12,439
going on in Gail's mind was because he
 

8175
03:46:12,439 --> 03:46:15,469
going on in Gail's mind was because he
was he just found out that uh Walt had

I'm wondering now is this a stray cat
because such a like I I rarely see white

8956
04:08:29,469 --> 04:08:29,479
because such a like I I rarely see white
 

8957
04:08:29,479 --> 04:08:31,670
because such a like I I rarely see white
cats especially among stray cats but it

8958
04:08:31,670 --> 04:08:31,680
cats especially among stray cats but it
 

8959
04:08:31,680 --> 04:08:34,950
cats especially among stray cats but it
could be or does it belong to the resort

8960
04:08:34,950 --> 04:08:34,960
could be or does it belong to the resort
 

8961
04:08:34,960 --> 04:08:36,630
could be or does it belong to the resort
or does it belong to the guy but I feel

8962
04:08:36,630 --> 04:08:36,640
or does it belong to the guy but I feel
 

8963
04:08:36,640 --> 04:08:39,550
or does it belong to the guy but I feel
like the cat like cuz it ran away like

8964
04:08:39,550 --> 04:08:39,560
like the cat like cuz it ran away like
 

8965
04:08:39,560 --> 04:08:43,229
like the cat like cuz it ran away like
he you can bring your pets to the hotel

8966
04:08:43,229 --> 04:08:43,239
he you can bring your pets to the hotel
 

8967
04:08:43,239 --> 04:08:46,030
he you can bring your pets to the hotel
but but bringing a cat seems kind of

8968
04:08:46,030 --> 04:08:46,040
but but bringing a cat seems kind of
 

8969
04:08:46,040 --> 04:08:48,269
but but bringing a cat seems kind of
unusual and then taking it outside

8970
04:08:48,269 --> 04:08:48,279
unusual and then taking it outside
 

8971
04:08:48,279 --> 04:08:49,870
unusual and then taking it outside
without having it on a leash seems even

8972
04:08:49,870 --> 04:08:49,880
without having it on a leash seems even
 

8973
04:08:49,880 --> 04:08:51,590
without having it on a leash seems even
more unusual so I think it might have

9418
04:21:25,870 --> 04:21:25,880
they put a lot of work and love into
 

9419
04:21:25,880 --> 04:21:31,670
they put a lot of work and love into
it but it was kind of crazily rushed the

9420
04:21:31,670 --> 04:21:31,680
it but it was kind of crazily rushed the
 

9421
04:21:31,680 --> 04:21:35,149
it but it was kind of crazily rushed the
pacing was so weird H starting from the

9422
04:21:35,149 --> 04:21:35,159
pacing was so weird H starting from the
 

9423
04:21:35,159 --> 04:21:39,309
pacing was so weird H starting from the
fourth episode espe especially to me

9424
04:21:39,309 --> 04:21:39,319
fourth episode espe especially to me
 

9425
04:21:39,319 --> 04:21:41,189
fourth episode espe especially to me
once I noticed that I Tred to observe it

9426
04:21:41,189 --> 04:21:41,199
once I noticed that I Tred to observe it
 

9427
04:21:41,199 --> 04:21:43,070
once I noticed that I Tred to observe it
really

9428
04:21:43,070 --> 04:21:43,080
really
 

9429
04:21:43,080 --> 04:21:47,030
really
closely I felt the fourth the fifth was

9430
04:21:47,030 --> 04:21:47,040
closely I felt the fourth the fifth was
 

9431
04:21:47,040 --> 04:21:50,149
closely I felt the fourth the fifth was
weirdly paced the sixth was okay again

9432
04:21:50,149 --> 04:21:50,159
weirdly paced the sixth was okay again
 

9433
04:21:50,159 --> 04:21:53,349
weirdly paced the sixth was okay again
the seventh was really weirdly paced

9434
04:21:53,349 --> 04:21:53,359
the seventh was really weirdly paced
 

9435
04:21:53,359 --> 04:21:56,389
the seventh was really weirdly paced
too and surprisingly the the finale I

9436
04:21:56,389 --> 04:21:56,399
too and surprisingly the the finale I
 

9437
04:21:56,399 --> 04:21:58,870
too and surprisingly the the finale I
think was the eighth right that one I

9438
04:21:58,870 --> 04:21:58,880
think was the eighth right that one I
 

9439
04:21:58,880 --> 04:22:03,269
think was the eighth right that one I
felt was more okay again but maybe

9440
04:22:03,269 --> 04:22:03,279
felt was more okay again but maybe
 

9441
04:22:03,279 --> 04:22:05,389
felt was more okay again but maybe
that's just because it was coming out of

9442
04:22:05,389 --> 04:22:05,399
that's just because it was coming out of
 

9443
04:22:05,399 --> 04:22:12,790
that's just because it was coming out of
a really fastpaced weirdly paced episode

9444
04:22:12,790 --> 04:22:12,800

 

9445
04:22:12,800 --> 04:22:14,830

on its own maybe the finale would have

9446
04:22:14,830 --> 04:22:14,840
on its own maybe the finale would have
 

9447
04:22:14,840 --> 04:22:18,630
on its own maybe the finale would have
been or should feel too fast paced and

9448
04:22:18,630 --> 04:22:18,640
been or should feel too fast paced and
 

9449
04:22:18,640 --> 04:22:20,870

way that Jinx and by were suddenly okay
 

9481
04:23:06,159 --> 04:23:08,189
way that Jinx and by were suddenly okay
with each other

9482
04:23:08,189 --> 04:23:08,199
with each other
 

9483
04:23:08,199 --> 04:23:12,950

again it feels like they skipped so
 

9485
04:23:12,960 --> 04:23:14,590
again it feels like they skipped so
much

9486
04:23:14,590 --> 04:23:14,600
much
 

9487
04:23:14,600 --> 04:23:19,790
much
of fixing their friendship

9488
04:23:19,790 --> 04:23:19,800

 

9489
04:23:19,800 --> 04:23:23,950

relationship like I I can see how that's

9490
04:23:23,950 --> 04:23:23,960
relationship like I I can see how that's
 

9491
04:23:23,960 --> 04:23:26,189
relationship like I I can see how that's
probably because like how why she was

9492
04:23:26,189 --> 04:23:26,199
probably because like how why she was
 

9493
04:23:26,199 --> 04:23:27,750
probably because like how why she was
okay with her again was probably because

9494
04:23:27,750 --> 04:23:27,760
okay with her again was probably because
 

9495
04:23:27,760 --> 04:23:30,229
okay with her again was probably because
she was not with Caitlyn anymore and

9496
04:23:30,229 --> 04:23:30,239
she was not with Caitlyn anymore and
 

9497
04:23:30,239 --> 04:23:32,189
she was not with Caitlyn anymore and
just on her own and she was like super

9498
04:23:32,189 --> 04:23:32,199
just on her own and she was like super
 

9499
04:23:32,199 --> 04:23:37,630
just on her own and she was like super
emo now but no it was still too

9500
04:23:37,630 --> 04:23:37,640
emo now but no it was still too
 

9501
04:23:37,640 --> 04:23:44,550
emo now but no it was still too
fast I think it was still way too fast

9502
04:23:44,550 --> 04:23:44,560

 

9503
04:23:44,560 --> 04:23:47,149

like why are they suddenly so okay with
each other and working so well with each

9506
04:23:50,030 --> 04:23:50,040
each other and working so well with each
 

9507
04:23:50,040 --> 04:23:55,030
each other and working so well with each
other I don't think that was

9508
04:23:55,030 --> 04:23:55,040

 

9509
04:23:55,040 --> 04:23:57,910

04:23:57,920 --> 04:23:59,750
good that was really unfortunate because

their broken
 

9513
04:23:59,760 --> 04:24:03,229
their broken
relationship is one of the main points

9514
04:24:03,229 --> 04:24:03,239
relationship is one of the main points
 

9515
04:24:03,239 --> 04:24:06,510
relationship is one of the main points
of the show and the storyline so you

9516
04:24:06,510 --> 04:24:06,520
of the show and the storyline so you
 

9517
04:24:06,520 --> 04:24:08,309
of the show and the storyline so you
can't just rush through that that was

9518
04:24:08,309 --> 04:24:08,319
can't just rush through that that was
 

9519
04:24:08,319 --> 04:24:11,670
can't just rush through that that was
something everybody was so invested in

9520
04:24:11,670 --> 04:24:11,680
something everybody was so invested in

11371
05:18:48,120 --> 05:19:00,190
know if that makes any sense to do if
there's no like big connection like a h

11372
05:19:00,190 --> 05:19:00,200

 

11373
05:19:00,200 --> 05:19:05,110

does it make sense to like make European
 

11377
05:19:08,920 --> 05:19:11,150
does it make sense to like make European
an travel to na or does it make more

an travel to na or does it make more

sense to make NA people travel to Europe
 

11381
05:19:14,958 --> 05:19:18,150
sense to make NA people travel to Europe
when more viewers and more possible

11382
05:19:18,150 --> 05:19:18,160
when more viewers and more possible
 

11383
05:19:18,160 --> 05:19:21,548
when more viewers and more possible
concert goers are in na unfortunately

concert goers are in na unfortunately
 

11385
05:19:21,558 --> 05:19:25,030
concert goers are in na unfortunately
that is the reality that the answer is

11386
05:19:25,030 --> 05:19:25,040
that is the reality that the answer is
 

11387
05:19:25,040 --> 05:19:28,190
that is the reality that the answer is
make him travel to

11388
05:19:28,190 --> 05:19:28,200

 

11389
05:19:28,200 --> 05:19:31,390

na we are fine going for dami yeah but

11390
05:19:31,390 --> 05:19:31,400
na we are fine going for dami yeah but
 

11391
05:19:31,400 --> 05:19:34,750
na we are fine going for dami yeah but
like not all of Na people are you know

11392
05:19:34,750 --> 05:19:34,760
like not all of Na people are you know
 

11393
05:19:34,760 --> 05:19:39,830
like not all of Na people are you know
there's just more possible

11394
05:19:39,830 --> 05:19:39,840
there's just more possible
 

11395
05:19:39,840 --> 05:19:43,030
there's just more possible
audience uh in

11396
05:19:43,030 --> 05:19:43,040
audience uh in
 

11397
05:19:43,040 --> 05:19:47,390
audience uh in
na yeah if Europe grows more you know

11398
05:19:47,390 --> 05:19:47,400
na yeah if Europe grows more you know
 

11399
05:19:47,400 --> 05:19:50,510
na yeah if Europe grows more you know
that would be

11400
05:19:50,510 --> 05:19:50,520
that would be
 

11401
05:19:50,520 --> 05:19:52,110
that would be
nice

11402
05:19:52,110 --> 05:19:52,120
nice
 

11403
05:19:52,120 --> 05:19:55,390
nice
but I feel like would be nice to maybe

11404
05:19:55,390 --> 05:19:55,400
but I feel like would be nice to maybe
 

11405
05:19:55,400 --> 05:19:58,788
but I feel like would be nice to maybe
look into having even though there's

11406
05:19:58,788 --> 05:19:58,798
look into having even though there's
 

11407
05:19:58,798 --> 05:19:59,788
look into having even though there's
time

11408
05:19:59,788 --> 05:19:59,798
time
 

11409
05:19:59,798 --> 05:20:03,350
time
zones like s cuz like we're virtual

11410
05:20:03,350 --> 05:20:03,360
zones like s cuz like we're virtual
 

11411
05:20:03,360 --> 05:20:07,310
zones like s cuz like we're virtual
right so I wonder if we can't do like

11412
05:20:07,310 --> 05:20:07,320
right so I wonder if we can't do like
 

11413
05:20:07,320 --> 05:20:11,190
right so I wonder if we can't do like
rent aent men you in Europe and in na at

11414
05:20:11,190 --> 05:20:11,200
rent aent men you in Europe and in na at
 

11415
05:20:11,200 --> 05:20:13,830
rent aent men you in Europe and in na at
the same time have the concert at the

11416
05:20:13,830 --> 05:20:13,840
the same time have the concert at the
 

11417
05:20:13,840 --> 05:20:17,390
the same time have the concert at the
same time like live at the same

11418
05:20:17,390 --> 05:20:17,400
same time like live at the same
 

11419
05:20:17,400 --> 05:20:20,910
same time like live at the same
time and be in two places at once yeah

11420
05:20:20,910 --> 05:20:20,920
time and be in two places at once yeah
 

11421
05:20:20,920 --> 05:20:23,590
time and be in two places at once yeah
that'd be sick but that means I have to

11422
05:20:23,590 --> 05:20:23,600
that'd be sick but that means I have to
 

11423
05:20:23,600 --> 05:20:26,190
that'd be sick but that means I have to
fill two venues I don't think I can do

11424
05:20:26,190 --> 05:20:26,200
fill two venues I don't think I can do
 

11425
05:20:26,200 --> 05:20:30,150
fill two venues I don't think I can do
that at the same time yeah but like SLE

11426
05:20:30,150 --> 05:20:30,160
that at the same time yeah but like SLE
 

11427
05:20:30,160 --> 05:20:34,788
that at the same time yeah but like SLE
casting

11428
05:20:34,788 --> 05:20:34,798

 

11429
05:20:34,798 --> 05:20:38,350

yeah but if it's in like two continents

11430
05:20:38,350 --> 05:20:38,360
yeah but if it's in like two continents
 

11431
05:20:38,360 --> 05:20:41,230
yeah but if it's in like two continents
that are are like close is like Europe

11432
05:20:41,230 --> 05:20:41,240
that are are like close is like Europe
 

11433
05:20:41,240 --> 05:20:43,070
that are are like close is like Europe
and na then maybe you can still find a

11434
05:20:43,070 --> 05:20:43,080
and na then maybe you can still find a
 

11435
05:20:43,080 --> 05:20:45,310
and na then maybe you can still find a
middle ground in terms of

11436
05:20:45,310 --> 05:20:45,320
middle ground in terms of
 

11437
05:20:45,320 --> 05:20:48,430
middle ground in terms of
time can't do it in like three

11438
05:20:48,430 --> 05:20:48,440
time can't do it in like three
 

11439
05:20:48,440 --> 05:20:50,030
time can't do it in like three
continents at the same time though that

11440
05:20:50,030 --> 05:20:50,040
continents at the same time though that
 

11441
05:20:50,040 --> 05:20:56,548
continents at the same time though that
would be like Asia Europe na certainly

11442
05:20:56,548 --> 05:20:56,558

 

11443
05:20:56,558 --> 05:20:59,070

impossible it's a cool

11444
05:20:59,070 --> 05:20:59,080
impossible it's a cool
 

11445
05:20:59,080 --> 05:21:01,390
impossible it's a cool
idea

11446
05:21:01,390 --> 05:21:01,400
idea
 

11447
05:21:01,400 --> 05:21:03,868
idea
right yeah yeah theater screenings you

11448
05:21:03,868 --> 05:21:03,878
right yeah yeah theater screenings you
 

11449
05:21:03,878 --> 05:21:06,190
right yeah yeah theater screenings you
know that's different in my opinion

11450
05:21:06,190 --> 05:21:06,200
know that's different in my opinion
 

11451
05:21:06,200 --> 05:21:09,750
know that's different in my opinion
because that's set up in a

11452
05:21:09,750 --> 05:21:09,760
because that's set up in a
 

11453
05:21:09,760 --> 05:21:13,230
because that's set up in a
way that they're just screening whatever

11454
05:21:13,230 --> 05:21:13,240
way that they're just screening whatever
 

11455
05:21:13,240 --> 05:21:15,868
way that they're just screening whatever
is happening in a different venue like I

11456
05:21:15,868 --> 05:21:15,878
is happening in a different venue like I
 

11457
05:21:15,878 --> 05:21:16,990
is happening in a different venue like I
don't

11458
05:21:16,990 --> 05:21:17,000
don't
 

11459
05:21:17,000 --> 05:21:20,548
don't
know different different but worst case

11460
05:21:20,548 --> 05:21:20,558
