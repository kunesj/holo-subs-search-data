that see what you can CFT okay so this

4606
02:22:51,070 --> 02:22:51,080
that see what you can CFT okay so this
 

4607
02:22:51,080 --> 02:22:59,469
that see what you can CFT okay so this
has like base

4608
02:22:59,469 --> 02:22:59,479

 

4609
02:22:59,479 --> 02:23:07,190

84 okay the one I can make is pretty

4610
02:23:07,190 --> 02:23:07,200

 

4611
02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:09,349

low

4612
02:23:09,349 --> 02:23:09,359
low
 

4613
02:23:09,359 --> 02:23:12,590
low
oh cuz I'm missing the bases of the

4614
02:23:12,590 --> 02:23:12,600
oh cuz I'm missing the bases of the
 

4615
02:23:12,600 --> 02:23:15,550
oh cuz I'm missing the bases of the
other

4616
02:23:15,550 --> 02:23:15,560

it's okay I think this is fine damage

4622
02:23:47,590 --> 02:23:47,600

 

4623
02:23:47,600 --> 02:23:54,950

8148
04:23:29,389 --> 04:23:29,399
and so there's threee Parts at least
 

8149
04:23:29,399 --> 04:23:32,429
and so there's threee Parts at least
minimum three parts and you got to think

8150
04:23:32,429 --> 04:23:32,439
minimum three parts and you got to think
 

8151
04:23:32,439 --> 04:23:35,550
minimum three parts and you got to think
that this first shooting area usually

8152
04:23:35,550 --> 04:23:35,560
that this first shooting area usually
 

8153
04:23:35,560 --> 04:23:39,109
that this first shooting area usually
takes up like this whole half of the

8154
04:23:39,109 --> 04:23:39,119
takes up like this whole half of the
 

8155
04:23:39,119 --> 04:23:41,990
takes up like this whole half of the
cubicle and then yeah it's like honestly

8156
04:23:41,990 --> 04:23:42,000
cubicle and then yeah it's like honestly
 

8157
04:23:42,000 --> 04:23:43,790
cubicle and then yeah it's like honestly
I don't I I don't even this is a mystery

H cuz I I feel like uh if we read it
like it's if it's that short then I feel

11820
06:25:14,270 --> 06:25:14,280
like it's if it's that short then I feel
 

11821
06:25:14,280 --> 06:25:15,910
like it's if it's that short then I feel
like we can really only make one stream

11822
06:25:15,910 --> 06:25:15,920
like we can really only make one stream
 

11823
06:25:15,920 --> 06:25:16,990
like we can really only make one stream
out of

11824
06:25:16,990 --> 06:25:17,000
out of
 

11825
06:25:17,000 --> 06:25:20,070
out of
it so we would discuss the whole book in

11826
06:25:20,070 --> 06:25:20,080
it so we would discuss the whole book in
 

11827
06:25:20,080 --> 06:25:22,868
it so we would discuss the whole book in
one go normally I would say like let's

11828
06:25:22,868 --> 06:25:22,878
one go normally I would say like let's
 

11829
06:25:22,878 --> 06:25:25,150
one go normally I would say like let's
split it in chapters and all that in

11830
06:25:25,150 --> 06:25:25,160
split it in chapters and all that in
 

11831
06:25:25,160 --> 06:25:28,070
split it in chapters and all that in
several chapters if it was a longer book

11832
06:25:28,070 --> 06:25:28,080
several chapters if it was a longer book
 

11833
06:25:28,080 --> 06:25:29,708
several chapters if it was a longer book
and then get back together and all that

11834
06:25:29,708 --> 06:25:29,718
and then get back together and all that
 

11835
06:25:29,718 --> 06:25:31,310
and then get back together and all that

if we read the book the whole book
 

11901
06:26:56,440 --> 06:26:59,390
if we read the book the whole book
beforehand and the one stream on it

11902
06:26:59,390 --> 06:26:59,400
beforehand and the one stream on it
 

11903
06:26:59,400 --> 06:27:01,350
beforehand and the one stream on it
won't that be too much do you think it

11904
06:27:01,350 --> 06:27:01,360
won't that be too much do you think it
 

11905
06:27:01,360 --> 06:27:03,190
won't that be too much do you think it
will be too much to talk about in one

11906
06:27:03,190 --> 06:27:03,200
will be too much to talk about in one
 

11907
06:27:03,200 --> 06:27:07,110
will be too much to talk about in one
stream with several

11908
06:27:07,110 --> 06:27:07,120

 

11909
06:27:07,120 --> 06:27:09,830

people it may be short as a book but

11910
06:27:09,830 --> 06:27:09,840
people it may be short as a book but
 

11911
06:27:09,840 --> 06:27:23,590
people it may be short as a book but
like maybe it's a lot to talk about

11912
06:27:23,590 --> 06:27:23,600

 

11913
06:27:23,600 --> 06:27:26,750

though it's doable in a 2hour

11914
06:27:26,750 --> 06:27:26,760
though it's doable in a 2hour
 

11915
06:27:26,760 --> 06:27:30,150
though it's doable in a 2hour
stream I just feels like rushed though

11916
06:27:30,150 --> 06:27:30,160
stream I just feels like rushed though
 

11917
06:27:30,160 --> 06:27:31,788
stream I just feels like rushed though
but then splitting it when it's this

11918
06:27:31,788 --> 06:27:31,798
but then splitting it when it's this
 

11919
06:27:31,798 --> 06:27:35,750
but then splitting it when it's this
short also feels kind of weird

11920
06:27:35,750 --> 06:27:35,760
