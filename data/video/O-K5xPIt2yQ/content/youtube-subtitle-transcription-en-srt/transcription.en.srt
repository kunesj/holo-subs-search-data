I was determined to
 

15709
07:23:24,360 --> 07:23:26,930
I was determined to
stay away from her and

15710
07:23:26,930 --> 07:23:26,940
stay away from her and
 

15711
07:23:26,940 --> 07:23:30,170
stay away from her and
not give my germs a chance to jump over

15712

not give my germs a chance to jump over
 

15713
07:23:30,180 --> 07:23:33,830

I see it
 

16651
07:47:21,298 --> 07:47:23,208
I see it
that the view is kind of messed up I

16652
07:47:23,208 --> 07:47:23,218
that the view is kind of messed up I
 

16653
07:47:23,218 --> 07:47:24,890
that the view is kind of messed up I
don't know how to explain it but they're

16654
07:47:24,890 --> 07:47:24,900
don't know how to explain it but they're
 

16655
07:47:24,900 --> 07:47:26,570
don't know how to explain it but they're
just not sitting correctly and I keep on

16656
07:47:26,570 --> 07:47:26,580
just not sitting correctly and I keep on
 

16657
07:47:26,580 --> 07:47:31,070
just not sitting correctly and I keep on
adjusting them and Blue by Blue it sucks

16658
07:47:31,070 --> 07:47:31,080

 

16659
07:47:31,080 --> 07:47:33,110

the one thing that would be better is if

16660
07:47:33,110 --> 07:47:33,120
the one thing that would be better is if
 

16661
07:47:33,120 --> 07:47:34,968
the one thing that would be better is if
they were Wireless

16662
07:47:34,968 --> 07:47:34,978
they were Wireless
 

16663
07:47:34,978 --> 07:47:36,890
they were Wireless
so maybe I'll look at an option if

16664
07:47:36,890 --> 07:47:36,900
so maybe I'll look at an option if
 

16665
07:47:36,900 --> 07:47:38,990
so maybe I'll look at an option if
there's some relatively small ones that

16666
07:47:38,990 --> 07:47:39,000
there's some relatively small ones that
 

16667
07:47:39,000 --> 07:47:41,448
there's some relatively small ones that
are Wireless

16668
07:47:41,448 --> 07:47:41,458

 

16669
07:47:41,458 --> 07:47:47,628

because there are Wireless ones right

16670
07:47:47,628 --> 07:47:47,638

 

16671
07:47:47,638 --> 07:47:49,788

or if there's some kind of solution

16672
07:47:49,788 --> 07:47:49,798
or if there's some kind of solution
 

16673
07:47:49,798 --> 07:47:51,650
or if there's some kind of solution
where I can put a head tracker on my

16674
07:47:51,650 --> 07:47:51,660
where I can put a head tracker on my
 

16675

in terms of like how
 

16759
07:49:41,580 --> 07:49:43,510
in terms of like how
it will

16760
07:49:43,510 --> 07:49:43,520
it will
 

16761
07:49:43,520 --> 07:49:46,250
it will
find out what hands you you currently

16762
07:49:46,250 --> 07:49:46,260
find out what hands you you currently
 

16763
07:49:46,260 --> 07:49:48,288
find out what hands you you currently
are showing because there's like a

07:49:48,298 --> 07:49:50,030
are showing because there's like a
circle around so I'm guessing it works

16766
07:49:50,030 --> 07:49:50,040
circle around so I'm guessing it works
 

16767
07:49:50,040 --> 07:49:53,030
circle around so I'm guessing it works
similarly Maybe
