00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,829

because i

386
00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:47,839
because i
 

387
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,910
because i
i was thinking

388
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:49,920
i was thinking
 

389
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,430
i was thinking
because we have some problems with the

390
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:51,440
because we have some problems with the
 

391
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,949
because we have some problems with the
weight

392
00:14:52,949 --> 00:14:52,959
weight
 

393
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,829
weight
the seaplane allows less weight than the

394
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:55,839
the seaplane allows less weight than the
 

395
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:56,829
the seaplane allows less weight than the
actual

399
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,790
airplane to the maldives
so

400
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:00,800
so
 

401
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,509
so
i can't even max out my suitcase

402
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:03,519
i can't even max out my suitcase
 

403
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,509
i can't even max out my suitcase
i think but

404
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:05,519
i think but
 

405
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,710
i think but
um i'm thinking i should wear my

406
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:08,720
um i'm thinking i should wear my
 

407
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,110

heaviest garment

408
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:11,120
heaviest garment
 

409
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,870
heaviest garment
so that i don't have to put it into the

410
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:12,880
so that i don't have to put it into the
 

411
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,310
so that i don't have to put it into the
suitcase right

412
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:14,320
suitcase right
 

413
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,310
suitcase right
but the heaviest garment is i think my

414
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:16,320
but the heaviest garment is i think my
 

415
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,310
but the heaviest garment is i think my
prettiest garment that i'm bringing this

416
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:18,320
prettiest garment that i'm bringing this
 

417
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,829
prettiest garment that i'm bringing this
time

418
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:19,839
time
 

419
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:20,870
time
um

420
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:20,880
um
 

421
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,389
um
so if i wear it

422
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:22,399
so if i wear it
 

423
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,949
so if i wear it
during my travel then it's probably not

424
00:15:24,949 --> 00:15:24,959
during my travel then it's probably not

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,269
we realized that the seaplane is more
expensive than the flight to the

480
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:23,279
expensive than the flight to the
 

481
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,110
expensive than the flight to the
maldives itself

482
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:25,120
maldives itself
 

483
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,790
maldives itself
um

484
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:26,800
um
 

485
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,990

it's like an option
um

512
00:16:58,949 --> 00:16:58,959
um
 

513
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,670
um
with combining with like a domestic

514
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:01,680
with combining with like a domestic
 

515
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,390

flight or something like that i read

516
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:04,400
flight or something like that i read
 

517
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,189
flight or something like that i read
but

518
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:05,199
but
 

519
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,750
but
speedboat only really works if this if

520
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:07,760
speedboat only really works if this if
 

521
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,549
speedboat only really works if this if
the island is really close

522
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:10,559
the island is really close
 

523
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,789
the island is really close
and even then the price said that it

524
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:12,799
and even then the price said that it
 

525
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,150
and even then the price said that it
would still be

526
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:14,160
would still be
 

527
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,150
would still be
the same

528
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:16,160
the same
 

529
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,510
the same
which dad

530
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:17,520
which dad
 

531
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,350
which dad
