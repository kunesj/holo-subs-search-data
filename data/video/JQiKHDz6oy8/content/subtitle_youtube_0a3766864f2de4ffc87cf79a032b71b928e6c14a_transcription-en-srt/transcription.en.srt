00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:12,399
this is how you write it but i probably
 

431
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:13,910
this is how you write it but i probably
will just write it like this but you're

432
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:13,920
will just write it like this but you're
 

433
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,509
will just write it like this but you're
supposed to write it

434
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:15,519
supposed to write it
 

435
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,069

00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:26,720

 

443
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,269

but for example if you want to write la

444
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:29,279
but for example if you want to write la
 

445
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,630
but for example if you want to write la
then you add

446
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:30,640
then you add
 

447
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,670
then you add
this and then there is

so let's for example write my name

462
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:47,279
so let's for example write my name
 

463
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,350
so let's for example write my name
because i think we can do that

464
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:49,360
because i think we can do that
 

465
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,710
because i think we can do that
my name i think would be this because

466
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:52,720
my name i think would be this because
 

467
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,389
my name i think would be this because
that is cool

468
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:54,399
that is cool
 

469
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,069
that is cool
but in combination with that because

470
00:11:56,069 --> 00:11:56,079
but in combination with that because
 

471
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,150
but in combination with that because
that is key

472
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:58,160
that is key
 

473
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,150
that is key
and then uh

474
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:00,160
and then uh
 

475
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,750
and then uh
okay

476
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:01,760
okay
 

477
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,670
okay
and then we can't use this one we have

478
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:03,680
and then we can't use this one we have
 

479
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,069
and then we can't use this one we have
to use this one

what i know right now
 

619
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,110
what i know right now
um i know

00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:55,120
um i know
 

621
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,350
um i know
how you make these combinations now

622
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:57,360
how you make these combinations now
 

623
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,230
how you make these combinations now
because

624
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:58,240
because
 

625
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,710
because
um you start with these simple ones and

626
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:00,720
um you start with these simple ones and
 

627
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,110
um you start with these simple ones and
then you start combining them like this

628
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:03,120
then you start combining them like this
 

629
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,990
then you start combining them like this
for example as you saw this is made out

630
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:06,000
for example as you saw this is made out
 

631
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,350
for example as you saw this is made out
of two this is made out of two and this

00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:09,360
of two this is made out of two and this
 

633
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,629
of two this is made out of two and this
is made out of two but you can make them

634
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:12,639
is made out of two but you can make them
 

635
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:13,430
is made out of two but you can make them

637
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,829
uh
out of even four different things for

00:16:15,829 --> 00:16:15,839
out of even four different things for
 

639
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,470
out of even four different things for
example i think maybe four is the most

640
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:18,480
example i think maybe four is the most
 

641
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,430
example i think maybe four is the most
maybe

642
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:19,440
maybe
 

643
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,389
maybe
four combinations like you have one sign

you know
 

665
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,509
you know
because if we say we want to combine the

maybe if i would have given it more time
 

6944
03:25:38,319 --> 03:25:41,510
maybe if i would have given it more time
it wouldn't have felt so
