me there is the same things that i've
 

9660
05:04:28,080 --> 05:04:30,150
me there is the same things that i've
already learned somewhere else they all

9661
05:04:30,150 --> 05:04:30,160
already learned somewhere else they all
 

9662
05:04:30,160 --> 05:04:33,350
already learned somewhere else they all
do the same [\h__\h] they all the same [\h__\h]

9663
05:04:33,350 --> 05:04:33,360

there and this is not even one-on-one

9665
05:04:36,470 --> 05:04:36,480
there and this is not even one-on-one
 

9666
05:04:36,480 --> 05:04:38,470
there and this is not even one-on-one
this is not even a one-on-one session so

i don't really want to turn it down
because

9675
05:04:47,990 --> 05:04:48,000
because
 

9676
05:04:48,000 --> 05:04:50,470
because

9677
05:04:50,470 --> 05:04:50,480
it's kind of connected with the other
 

9678

it's kind of connected with the other
thing

9679
05:04:51,910 --> 05:04:51,920
thing
 

9680
05:04:51,920 --> 05:04:54,150

10062
05:13:42,560 --> 05:13:44,868

is better than a one-on-one session like

10063
05:13:44,868 --> 05:13:44,878
is better than a one-on-one session like
 

10064
05:13:44,878 --> 05:13:46,470
is better than a one-on-one session like
a one-on-one session is always better

10065

so

10075
05:13:57,750 --> 05:13:57,760
so
 

10076
05:13:57,760 --> 05:14:00,150

if it was another one-on-one session i i

10077

if it was another one-on-one session i i

unleash a surprising attack when

10333
05:19:44,070 --> 05:19:44,080
unleash a surprising attack when
 

10334
05:19:44,080 --> 05:19:47,750
unleash a surprising attack when
switching to slugger style

10335
05:19:47,750 --> 05:19:47,760

 

10336
05:19:47,760 --> 05:19:50,868

the moment i switch

10337
05:19:50,868 --> 05:19:50,878
the moment i switch
 

10338
05:19:50,878 --> 05:19:53,990
the moment i switch
right side from from another style 30 oh

10339
05:19:53,990 --> 05:19:54,000
right side from from another style 30 oh
 

10340
05:19:54,000 --> 05:19:56,948
right side from from another style 30 oh
so if i uh if i am at the third heat bar

10341
05:19:56,948 --> 05:19:56,958
so if i uh if i am at the third heat bar
 

10342
05:19:56,958 --> 05:20:01,430
so if i uh if i am at the third heat bar
and then switch to slugger style

10343
05:20:01,430 --> 05:20:01,440

 

10344
05:20:01,440 --> 05:20:03,670

because that's on the right side

10345
05:20:03,670 --> 05:20:03,680
because that's on the right side
 

10346
05:20:03,680 --> 05:20:06,230
because that's on the right side
then it will automatically

10347
05:20:06,230 --> 05:20:06,240
then it will automatically
 

10348
05:20:06,240 --> 05:20:08,390
then it will automatically
do a surprising attack okay

10349
05:20:08,390 --> 05:20:08,400
do a surprising attack okay
 

10350
05:20:08,400 --> 05:20:10,070

05:59:12,788 --> 05:59:12,798
to that whole story
 

11596
05:59:12,798 --> 05:59:14,708
to that whole story
i think was

11597
05:59:14,708 --> 05:59:14,718
i think was
 

11598
05:59:14,718 --> 05:59:15,670
i think was
like

11599
05:59:15,670 --> 05:59:15,680
like
 

11600
05:59:15,680 --> 05:59:18,310
like
imagine that was actually possible and

11601
05:59:18,310 --> 05:59:18,320
imagine that was actually possible and
 

11602

11609
05:59:27,750 --> 05:59:27,760
i think it makes sense to imagine as it
 

11610
05:59:27,760 --> 05:59:30,390

11611
05:59:30,390 --> 05:59:30,400
is also the same in the show
 

11612
05:59:30,400 --> 05:59:32,548

11614
05:59:32,558 --> 05:59:33,350
that
um

11615
05:59:33,350 --> 05:59:33,360
um
 

11616
05:59:33,360 --> 05:59:35,590
um
you know it's gonna not be

11617
05:59:35,590 --> 05:59:35,600
you know it's gonna not be
 

11618
05:59:35,600 --> 05:59:37,430
you know it's gonna not be
necessarily something that everybody can

11619
05:59:37,430 --> 05:59:37,440
