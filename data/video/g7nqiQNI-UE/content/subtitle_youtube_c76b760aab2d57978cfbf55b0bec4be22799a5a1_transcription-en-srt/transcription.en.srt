uh
 

1431
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:20,329
uh
apparently you have to do something at

00:44:20,329 --> 00:44:20,339
apparently you have to do something at
 

1433
00:44:20,339 --> 00:44:22,670
apparently you have to do something at
the top but I don't

1434
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:22,680
the top but I don't
 

1435
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,849

I didn't have to do that just now

00:44:24,849 --> 00:44:24,859
I didn't have to do that just now
 

1437
00:44:24,859 --> 00:44:28,309
I didn't have to do that just now
ah I was like one time when I was the

1438
00:44:28,309 --> 00:44:28,319
ah I was like one time when I was the
 

1439
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:31,190
ah I was like one time when I was the
Imposter in this world I was it was

1440
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:31,200
Imposter in this world I was it was

pointed out to me that I must be the
 

1443
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:35,750
pointed out to me that I must be the
impossible because I didn't run up to do

1444
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:35,760
impossible because I didn't run up to do
 

1445
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,510
impossible because I didn't run up to do
the task at the top in the beginning

1446
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:38,520
the task at the top in the beginning
 

1447
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,790
the task at the top in the beginning
but it's not a test if you always get

1448
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:40,800
but it's not a test if you always get
 

1449
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,130
but it's not a test if you always get

00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:48,960

 

1453
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,430

so you don't get it on time

1454
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:52,440
so you don't get it on time
 

1455
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,290
so you don't get it on time
so

1456
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:54,300
so
 

1457
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:57,349
so
so I was not necessarily the impossible

1458
00:44:57,349 --> 00:44:57,359
so I was not necessarily the impossible
 

1459
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:59,089
so I was not necessarily the impossible
but now now I remember that and I

1460
00:44:59,089 --> 00:44:59,099
but now now I remember that and I
 

1461
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:01,130
but now now I remember that and I
thought okay I have to go up but there

1462
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:01,140

was nothing to do

1464
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:02,880
