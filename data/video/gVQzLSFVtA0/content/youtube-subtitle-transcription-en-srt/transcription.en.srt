my dog went that way

2376
01:08:33,229 --> 01:08:33,239

 

2377
01:08:33,239 --> 01:08:35,990

okay where the locals hey tourists I

2378
01:08:35,990 --> 01:08:36,000
okay where the locals hey tourists I
 

2379
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,189
okay where the locals hey tourists I
wonder if there even are that many

2380
01:08:38,189 --> 01:08:38,199
wonder if there even are that many
 

2381
01:08:38,199 --> 01:08:40,030
wonder if there even are that many
locals cuz I can imagine housing being

2382
01:08:40,030 --> 01:08:40,040
locals cuz I can imagine housing being
 

2383
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:41,630
locals cuz I can imagine housing being
very expensive there and it's a pretty

2384
01:08:41,630 --> 01:08:41,640
very expensive there and it's a pretty
 

2385
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:42,590
very expensive there and it's a pretty
small

2386
01:08:42,590 --> 01:08:42,600

island
 

2389
01:08:44,839 --> 01:08:47,630
island
so there's probably not that many locals

2390
01:08:47,630 --> 01:08:47,640
so there's probably not that many locals
 

2391
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:49,709
so there's probably not that many locals
I feel like the locals to tourist ratio

2392
01:08:49,709 --> 01:08:49,719
I feel like the locals to tourist ratio
 

2393
01:08:49,719 --> 01:08:53,229
I feel like the locals to tourist ratio

01:25:49,550 --> 01:25:49,560
yeah so seemingly you couldn't go any
 

3137
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:52,109
yeah so seemingly you couldn't go any
further and I was pretty frustrated at

3138
01:25:52,109 --> 01:25:52,119
further and I was pretty frustrated at
 

3139
01:25:52,119 --> 01:25:53,910
further and I was pretty frustrated at
this point because I was pretty burned

3140
01:25:53,910 --> 01:25:53,920
this point because I was pretty burned
 

3141
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:56,790
this point because I was pretty burned
out for from previous travels and I I

3142
01:25:56,790 --> 01:25:56,800
out for from previous travels and I I
 

3143
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:59,189
out for from previous travels and I I
just I thought you know that the

3144
01:25:59,189 --> 01:25:59,199
just I thought you know that the
 

3145
01:25:59,199 --> 01:26:01,430
just I thought you know that the
transport would go

3146
01:26:01,430 --> 01:26:01,440
transport would go
 

3147
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:04,270
transport would go
smoothly but

3148
01:26:04,270 --> 01:26:04,280
smoothly but
 

3149
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:08,189
smoothly but
no so yeah we walked around a little bit

3150
01:26:08,189 --> 01:26:08,199
no so yeah we walked around a little bit
 

3151
01:26:08,199 --> 01:26:10,709
no so yeah we walked around a little bit
and then we find you know that these

3152
01:26:10,709 --> 01:26:10,719
and then we find you know that these
 

3153
01:26:10,719 --> 01:26:12,550
and then we find you know that these
water taxes they're all around the

3154
01:26:12,550 --> 01:26:12,560
water taxes they're all around the
 

3155
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:15,030
water taxes they're all around the
canals and they they constantly are

3156
01:26:15,030 --> 01:26:15,040
canals and they they constantly are
 

3157
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:18,310
canals and they they constantly are
ready to pick up people at any time so

3158
01:26:18,310 --> 01:26:18,320
ready to pick up people at any time so
 

3159
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:21,229
ready to pick up people at any time so
we asked one not really hoping for any

3160
01:26:21,229 --> 01:26:21,239
we asked one not really hoping for any
 

3161
01:26:21,239 --> 01:26:23,629
we asked one not really hoping for any
good price but this guy gave us a really

3162
01:26:23,629 --> 01:26:23,639
good price but this guy gave us a really
 

3163
01:26:23,639 --> 01:26:25,270
good price but this guy gave us a really
cheap price

3164
01:26:25,270 --> 01:26:25,280
cheap price
 

3165
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:28,270
cheap price
think it was like I don't

3166
01:26:28,270 --> 01:26:28,280
think it was like I don't
 

3167
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:31,390
think it was like I don't
know maybe 30 per

3168
01:26:31,390 --> 01:26:31,400
know maybe 30 per
 

3169
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:34,550
know maybe 30 per
person which was like half of what Uber

3170
01:26:34,550 --> 01:26:34,560
person which was like half of what Uber
 

3171
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:37,430
person which was like half of what Uber
was giving us so I think it was like 60

3172
01:26:37,430 --> 01:26:37,440
was giving us so I think it was like 60
 

3173
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:39,910
was giving us so I think it was like 60
or so in

3174
01:26:39,910 --> 01:26:39,920
or so in
 

3175
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:42,510
or so in
total but then you think like 40 minute

3176
01:26:42,510 --> 01:26:42,520
total but then you think like 40 minute
 

3177
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:44,790
total but then you think like 40 minute
walk if we didn't have so many you know

3178
01:26:44,790 --> 01:26:44,800
walk if we didn't have so many you know
 

3179
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:47,070
walk if we didn't have so many you know
luggage with us we would have probably

3180
01:26:47,070 --> 01:26:47,080
luggage with us we would have probably
 

3181
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:49,590
luggage with us we would have probably
walked but at the same time it was kind

3182
01:26:49,590 --> 01:26:49,600
walked but at the same time it was kind
 

3183
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:52,590
walked but at the same time it was kind
of a tour too because like in this taxi

was in Japan and and even then you know
 

12733
06:04:51,040 --> 06:04:52,310
was in Japan and and even then you know
I wasn't sure if I was going to do it

12734
06:04:52,310 --> 06:04:52,320
I wasn't sure if I was going to do it
 

12735
06:04:52,320 --> 06:04:53,750
I wasn't sure if I was going to do it
until last minute because I wasn't sure

12736
06:04:53,750 --> 06:04:53,760
until last minute because I wasn't sure
 

12737

the riddle in the end because it was

13210
06:16:11,190 --> 06:16:11,200
the riddle in the end because it was
 

13211
06:16:11,200 --> 06:16:12,990
the riddle in the end because it was
mostly on their

13212
06:16:12,990 --> 06:16:13,000
mostly on their

the sign here uh with
 

13281
06:18:02,680 --> 06:18:05,468
the sign here uh with
like all kinds of words and in random

13282
06:18:05,468 --> 06:18:05,478
like all kinds of words and in random
 

13283
06:18:05,478 --> 06:18:07,708

in the end I don't think
 

13291
06:18:14,360 --> 06:18:16,750
in the end I don't think
so um well we were communicating through

13292
06:18:16,750 --> 06:18:16,760
so um well we were communicating through
 

13293
06:18:16,760 --> 06:18:19,708
so um well we were communicating through
the phone while looking at that and then

13294
06:18:19,708 --> 06:18:19,718
the phone while looking at that and then
 

13295
06:18:19,718 --> 06:18:21,670
the phone while looking at that and then
we clear it I

13296
06:18:21,670 --> 06:18:21,680
we clear it I
 

13297
06:18:21,680 --> 06:18:24,868
we clear it I
guess I guess we did because then
