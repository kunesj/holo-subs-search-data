5366
02:48:42,150 --> 02:48:42,160
think at that point that's where I I
 

5367
02:48:42,160 --> 02:48:46,429
think at that point that's where I I
lost my energy I and perhaps my focus I

5368
02:48:46,429 --> 02:48:46,439
lost my energy I and perhaps my focus I
 

5369

02:48:50,230 --> 02:48:50,240
slept 4 hours or something by the way
 

5371
02:48:50,240 --> 02:48:52,110
slept 4 hours or something by the way
which means I did manage to sleep quite

5372
02:48:52,110 --> 02:48:52,120
which means I did manage to sleep quite
 

5373
02:48:52,120 --> 02:48:54,110
which means I did manage to sleep quite
early I had to get up at

5374
02:48:54,110 --> 02:48:54,120
early I had to get up at
 

5375
02:48:54,120 --> 02:48:57,830
early I had to get up at
4:30 so I slept around like midnight or

5376
02:48:57,830 --> 02:48:57,840
4:30 so I slept around like midnight or
 

5377
02:48:57,840 --> 02:49:01,269
4:30 so I slept around like midnight or
even earlier but I woke up so many times

5378
02:49:01,269 --> 02:49:01,279
even earlier but I woke up so many times
 

5379
02:49:01,279 --> 02:49:05,110
even earlier but I woke up so many times
too so that kind of maybe explains

5380
02:49:05,110 --> 02:49:05,120
too so that kind of maybe explains
 

5381
02:49:05,120 --> 02:49:07,710
too so that kind of maybe explains
why um I

5382
02:49:07,710 --> 02:49:07,720
why um I
 

5383
02:49:07,720 --> 02:49:11,389

02:49:41,750 --> 02:49:41,760
was insane like the countdown would be
 

5405
02:49:41,760 --> 02:49:44,790
was insane like the countdown would be
like 3 to one and then fade away and

5406
02:49:44,790 --> 02:49:44,800
like 3 to one and then fade away and
 

5407
02:49:44,800 --> 02:49:47,990
like 3 to one and then fade away and
it's kind of like at zero you stop even

5408
02:49:47,990 --> 02:49:48,000
it's kind of like at zero you stop even
 

5409
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:50,150
it's kind of like at zero you stop even
though it doesn't show at

though it doesn't show at
 

5411
02:49:50,160 --> 02:49:53,510
though it doesn't show at
zero but we already had to stop at two

5412
02:49:53,510 --> 02:49:53,520
zero but we already had to stop at two
 

5413
02:49:53,520 --> 02:49:56,790
zero but we already had to stop at two
for some of us and then for others other

8994
04:38:37,390 --> 04:38:37,400
and I keep on saying I'll do it at some
 

8995
04:38:37,400 --> 04:38:40,429
and I keep on saying I'll do it at some
point but I never get to it I always

8996
04:38:40,429 --> 04:38:40,439
point but I never get to it I always
 

8997
04:38:40,439 --> 04:38:42,910
point but I never get to it I always
forget what movie are we going to watch

8998
04:38:42,910 --> 04:38:42,920
forget what movie are we going to watch
 

8999
04:38:42,920 --> 04:38:45,590
forget what movie are we going to watch
that's a good question so right now I'm

9000
04:38:45,590 --> 04:38:45,600
that's a good question so right now I'm
 

9001
04:38:45,600 --> 04:38:48,109
that's a good question so right now I'm
considering Narnia cuz that was quite a

9002
04:38:48,109 --> 04:38:48,119
considering Narnia cuz that was quite a
 

9003
04:38:48,119 --> 04:38:50,750
considering Narnia cuz that was quite a
good suggestion because that can also

9004
04:38:50,750 --> 04:38:50,760
good suggestion because that can also
 

9005
04:38:50,760 --> 04:38:55,070
good suggestion because that can also
turn into a um a series we can watch all

9006
04:38:55,070 --> 04:38:55,080
turn into a um a series we can watch all
 

9007
04:38:55,080 --> 04:38:58,629
turn into a um a series we can watch all
I think there's free right free Narnia

9008
04:38:58,629 --> 04:38:58,639
I think there's free right free Narnia
 

9009
04:38:58,639 --> 04:39:03,949
I think there's free right free Narnia
movies and I've never watched them
