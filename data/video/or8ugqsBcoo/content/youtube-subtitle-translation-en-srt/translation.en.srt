193
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:33,480
everyone.  So, let's start with the red team, and let's
 

194
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,509
everyone.  So, let's start with the red team, and let's
play with each other.I think there's probably a good

195
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:37,519
play with each other.I think there's probably a good
 

196
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,470
play with each other.I think there's probably a good
balance between each of them.I think the number of people

197
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:40,480
balance between each of them.I think the number of people
 

198
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,910
balance between each of them.I think the number of people
is gathered.Yeah, yeah, in general, there are

199
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:43,920
is gathered.Yeah, yeah, in general, there are
 

200
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,990
is gathered.Yeah, yeah, in general, there are
too few whites and too few yellows.  I looked at it to see

201
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,000
too few whites and too few yellows.  I looked at it to see
 

202
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,470
too few whites and too few yellows.  I looked at it to see
if it was too much or too little red.I did

203
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:48,480
if it was too much or too little red.I did
 

204
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,030
if it was too much or too little red.I did
n't feel it, so I thought, ``Yeah, yeah, that's good.''So then, there are

205
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,550
n't feel it, so I thought, ``Yeah, yeah, that's good.''So then, there are

01:16:14,030 --> 01:16:14,040
but maybe no one will do it
 

2122
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:17,430
but maybe no one will do it
anymore.

For example, if you mix it up, it means that you can do that fang line

2800
01:39:26,629 --> 01:39:26,639
For example, if you mix it up, it means that you can do that fang line

01:39:29,390 --> 01:39:32,790
while also being a hunter.
 

2803

2804
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:34,430

Does that mean you can do it by mixing up the members of different Lilles? Yes, you

2805
01:39:34,430 --> 01:39:34,440
Does that mean you can do it by mixing up the members of different Lilles? Yes, you

2807
01:39:36,550 --> 01:39:36,560
can do it by mixing the members of Rire.  amazing  It's
 

2808
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:41,149
can do it by mixing the members of Rire.  amazing  It's
amazing, it's amazing, so for example, everyone

2809
01:39:41,149 --> 01:39:41,159
amazing, it's amazing, so for example, everyone
 

2810
01:39:41,159 --> 01:39:45,390
amazing, it's amazing, so for example, everyone
touches the entry signboard, and at first, it's

2811
01:39:45,390 --> 01:39:48,790
touches the entry signboard, and at first, it's
 

2812
01:39:48,790 --> 01:39:48,800

 

2813
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:52,189

easy to move fast, and if you touch wherever you like, whether it's white, yellow, or red, you can do it,

2814
01:39:52,189 --> 01:39:52,199
easy to move fast, and if you touch wherever you like, whether it's white, yellow, or red, you can do it,
 

2815
01:39:52,199 --> 01:39:56,350
easy to move fast, and if you touch wherever you like, whether it's white, yellow, or red, you can do it,
and you can

2816
01:39:56,350 --> 01:39:56,360

2817
01:39:56,360 --> 01:39:58,910
and you can
run up to 3,279 people.That's

2818
01:39:58,910 --> 01:39:58,920
run up to 3,279 people.That's
 

2819
01:39:58,920 --> 01:40:02,910
run up to 3,279 people.That's
right.  9 But by the time there are 9 people, the

2820
01:40:02,910 --> 01:40:02,920
right.  9 But by the time there are 9 people, the
 

2821
01:40:02,920 --> 01:40:06,310
right.  9 But by the time there are 9 people, the
anchor person will run one lap,

2822
01:40:06,310 --> 01:40:10,830
anchor person will run one lap,
 

2823
01:40:10,830 --> 01:40:10,840

 

2824
01:40:10,840 --> 01:40:16,030

and they can do it in a blink of an eye. Yeah, it would be nice if they could do that, so they'll do it next

2825
01:40:16,030 --> 01:40:16,040
and they can do it in a blink of an eye. Yeah, it would be nice if they could do that, so they'll do it next
 

2826
01:40:16,040 --> 01:40:19,990
and they can do it in a blink of an eye. Yeah, it would be nice if they could do that, so they'll do it next
time. But if they can't do it right now, yeah, yeah.

2827
01:40:19,990 --> 01:40:20,000
time. But if they can't do it right now, yeah, yeah.
 

2828
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,669
time. But if they can't do it right now, yeah, yeah.
2  in the third time  I

2829
01:40:21,669 --> 01:40:23,709
2  in the third time  I
 

2830
01:40:23,709 --> 01:40:26,310

 

2831
01:40:26,310 --> 01:40:26,320

 

2832
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:28,750

wonder if I should just join in and do whatever I want after that.Well, there are some people on the other teams who aren't able to do it.I see,

2833
01:40:28,750 --> 01:40:28,760
wonder if I should just join in and do whatever I want after that.Well, there are some people on the other teams who aren't able to do it.I see,
 

2834
01:40:28,760 --> 01:40:32,310
wonder if I should just join in and do whatever I want after that.Well, there are some people on the other teams who aren't able to do it.I see,
there are some people who are acting violently, so let's

2835
01:40:32,310 --> 01:40:32,320
there are some people who are acting violently, so let's
 

2836
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:35,629
there are some people who are acting violently, so let's
do it again with the full members.  Well, I guess it's

2837
01:40:35,629 --> 01:40:35,639
do it again with the full members.  Well, I guess it's
 

2838
01:40:35,639 --> 01:40:37,910
do it again with the full members.  Well, I guess it's
fine if the team is a mess anyway, so I guess that's the case.Then

2839
01:40:37,910 --> 01:40:37,920
fine if the team is a mess anyway, so I guess that's the case.Then
 

2840
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:40,550
fine if the team is a mess anyway, so I guess that's the case.Then
how do you decide?The

2841
01:40:40,550 --> 01:40:40,560
how do you decide?The
 

2842
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:45,430
how do you decide?The
team will have a quick story, and

2843
01:40:45,430 --> 01:40:45,440
team will have a quick story, and
 

2844
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:48,870
team will have a quick story, and
then they'll be able to support each other as they see fit.  I

2845
01:40:48,870 --> 01:40:53,830
then they'll be able to support each other as they see fit.  I
 

2846
01:40:53,830 --> 01:40:56,109

 

2847
01:40:56,109 --> 01:40:58,149

 

2848
01:40:58,149 --> 01:41:02,149

 

2849
01:41:02,149 --> 01:41:02,159

3065
01:48:14,030 --> 01:48:14,040
all you have to do is throw some money,
 

3066
01:48:14,040 --> 01:48:16,629
all you have to do is throw some money,
right?

3067
01:48:16,629 --> 01:48:16,639
right?
 

3068
01:48:16,639 --> 01:48:21,070
right?
Oh, who is it good for?

3069
01:48:21,070 --> 01:48:21,080

Oh, who is it good for?
Why are you throwing it at me? It's really

3071
01:48:24,790 --> 01:48:24,800
Why are you throwing it at me? It's really
 

3072
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:27,990
Why are you throwing it at me? It's really
starting from 1,000 yen to 1,000 yen,

3073
01:48:27,990 --> 01:48:28,000
starting from 1,000 yen to 1,000 yen,
 

3074
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,510
starting from 1,000 yen to 1,000 yen,
but it's a little expensive. Isn't it

3075
01:48:30,510 --> 01:48:30,520
but it's a little expensive. Isn't it
 

3076
01:48:30,520 --> 01:48:33,310
but it's a little expensive. Isn't it
okay to start from 5 yen?

3077
01:48:33,310 --> 01:48:33,320
okay to start from 5 yen?
 

3078
01:48:33,320 --> 01:48:39,510

so I've never been to the Plaza.  The

4040
02:21:37,030 --> 02:21:40,910
so I've never been to the Plaza.  The

was probably the third row. It's
 

4046
02:21:47,760 --> 02:21:50,630
was probably the third row. It's
not that bad. It's amazing that something like that could happen.

4047
02:21:50,630 --> 02:21:50,640
not that bad. It's amazing that something like that could happen.
 

4048

4056
02:22:10,280 --> 02:22:13,510

sure the sweat will be flying off of me. It's no one else's sweat. Maybe it's the people around me who are sweating more than the idol.  Because it is  It

4057
02:22:13,510 --> 02:22:13,520
sure the sweat will be flying off of me. It's no one else's sweat. Maybe it's the people around me who are sweating more than the idol.  Because it is  It

4065
02:22:25,439 --> 02:22:27,870

sad that Ekana-tan never had the chance to experience something like that before,

4066
02:22:27,870 --> 02:22:27,880
sad that Ekana-tan never had the chance to experience something like that before,
 

4067
02:22:27,880 --> 02:22:30,830
sad that Ekana-tan never had the chance to experience something like that before,
but he doesn't say that, so it's sad.  Well, after

4068
02:22:30,830 --> 02:22:30,840
but he doesn't say that, so it's sad.  Well, after
 

4069
02:22:30,840 --> 02:22:33,309
but he doesn't say that, so it's sad.  Well, after
