4478
01:49:45,109 --> 01:49:45,119
battery drain to zero yeah that's not
 

4479
01:49:45,119 --> 01:49:46,790
battery drain to zero yeah that's not
the case with this one you were not

4480
01:49:46,790 --> 01:49:46,800
the case with this one you were not
 

4481
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:49,589
the case with this one you were not
supposed to do that every single thing

4482
01:49:49,589 --> 01:49:49,599
supposed to do that every single thing
 

4483
01:49:49,599 --> 01:49:51,790
supposed to do that every single thing
was like that's dumb if you do that it's

4484
01:49:51,790 --> 01:49:51,800
was like that's dumb if you do that it's
 

4485
01:49:51,800 --> 01:49:54,149
was like that's dumb if you do that it's

it'll literally break the the battery
 

4487
01:49:54,159 --> 01:49:55,629
it'll literally break the the battery

01:49:55,629 --> 01:49:55,639
but that's also kind of ridiculous
 

4489
01:49:55,639 --> 01:49:56,910
but that's also kind of ridiculous
because I mean it happens and it

4490
01:49:56,910 --> 01:49:56,920
because I mean it happens and it
 

4491
01:49:56,920 --> 01:50:00,350
because I mean it happens and it
shouldn't be like a no girl a death

4492
01:50:00,350 --> 01:50:00,360
shouldn't be like a no girl a death

and to have the battery and again this
is like a common problem with all of the

4502
01:50:11,030 --> 01:50:11,040
is like a common problem with all of the
 

4503
01:50:11,040 --> 01:50:16,109
is like a common problem with all of the
Samsung S 2122 and 23 models um it's

4504
01:50:16,109 --> 01:50:16,119
Samsung S 2122 and 23 models um it's
 

4505
01:50:16,119 --> 01:50:19,070
Samsung S 2122 and 23 models um it's
just crazy yeah I mean eventually it

4506
01:50:19,070 --> 01:50:19,080
just crazy yeah I mean eventually it
 

4507
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:21,270
just crazy yeah I mean eventually it
will die that just happens even if

4508
01:50:21,270 --> 01:50:21,280
will die that just happens even if
 

4509
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:24,270
will die that just happens even if
you're trying to avoid it so like die as

4510
01:50:24,270 --> 01:50:24,280
you're trying to avoid it so like die as
 

4511
01:50:24,280 --> 01:50:27,589
you're trying to avoid it so like die as
and go to 0% and your off that's like

4512
01:50:27,589 --> 01:50:27,599
and go to 0% and your off that's like
 

4513
01:50:27,599 --> 01:50:31,030
and go to 0% and your off that's like
almost unavoidable at some point so

4514
01:50:31,030 --> 01:50:31,040
almost unavoidable at some point so
 

4515
01:50:31,040 --> 01:50:33,430
almost unavoidable at some point so
saying that never that it never drain to

4516
01:50:33,430 --> 01:50:33,440
saying that never that it never drain to
 

4517
01:50:33,440 --> 01:50:37,629
saying that never that it never drain to
0% is weird expectation it shouldn't

4518
01:50:37,629 --> 01:50:37,639
0% is weird expectation it shouldn't
 

4519
01:50:37,639 --> 01:50:41,430
0% is weird expectation it shouldn't
be yeah no right like and but it was

4520
01:50:41,430 --> 01:50:41,440
be yeah no right like and but it was

weird because they did you you've had it
drained to zero before and not had this

4524
01:50:45,629 --> 01:50:45,639
drained to zero before and not had this
 

4525
01:50:45,639 --> 01:50:47,870
drained to zero before and not had this
problem so it's weird because like it is

4526
01:50:47,870 --> 01:50:47,880
