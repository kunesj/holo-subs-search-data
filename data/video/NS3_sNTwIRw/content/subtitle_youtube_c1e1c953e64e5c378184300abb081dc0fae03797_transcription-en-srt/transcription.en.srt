here's my pitch ready for this we cover

1832
00:48:16,190 --> 00:48:16,200
here's my pitch ready for this we cover
 

1833
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:19,549
here's my pitch ready for this we cover
the entire bottom with ice and then we

1834
00:48:19,549 --> 00:48:19,559
the entire bottom with ice and then we
 

1835
00:48:19,559 --> 00:48:22,349
the entire bottom with ice and then we
get a mine cart so we or a boat we get a

1836
00:48:22,349 --> 00:48:22,359
get a mine cart so we or a boat we get a
 

1837
00:48:22,359 --> 00:48:25,309
get a mine cart so we or a boat we get a
boat so we can

1838
00:48:25,309 --> 00:48:25,319
boat so we can
 

1839
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:28,190
boat so we can
just that is a perfect idea it's like

1840
00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:28,200
just that is a perfect idea it's like
 

1841
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,430

the Z coordinate is at

2050
00:53:53,069 --> 00:53:53,079
the Z coordinate is at
 

2051
00:53:53,079 --> 00:53:55,230
the Z coordinate is at
990 and it should be going the other way

2052
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:55,240
990 and it should be going the other way
 

2053
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:56,829
990 and it should be going the other way
shouldn't it cuz good as Z coordinate

2054
00:53:56,829 --> 00:53:56,839
shouldn't it cuz good as Z coordinate
 

2055
00:53:56,839 --> 00:53:59,950
shouldn't it cuz good as Z coordinate
was 137 or something like 106 so if I

2056
00:53:59,950 --> 00:53:59,960
was 137 or something like 106 so if I
 

2057

2086
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:46,160
coordinate yeah yeah yeah yeah sort of
 

2087
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:49,829
coordinate yeah yeah yeah yeah sort of
yeah I mean it's going up the X the Z

2088
00:54:49,829 --> 00:54:49,839
yeah I mean it's going up the X the Z
 

2089

who cares about the Y right the Y is in
 

2091
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:54,390
who cares about the Y right the Y is in
the middle right I I don't know I don't

2092
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:54,400
the middle right I I don't know I don't

and then the the the wait which is the Z

2096
00:54:59,109 --> 00:54:59,119
and then the the the wait which is the Z
 

2097
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:03,710
and then the the the wait which is the Z
wait why is the Z like that hold

2098
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:03,720

 

2099
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:08,349

on is is z is z up and down or like what

2100
00:55:08,349 --> 00:55:08,359
on is is z is z up and down or like what
 

2101

going the wrong way on
right Z doesn't matter sh X we're also

2110
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:22,000
right Z doesn't matter sh X we're also
 

2111
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,870
right Z doesn't matter sh X we're also
not moving forward at all I feel like

2112
00:55:25,870 --> 00:55:25,880
not moving forward at all I feel like
 

2113
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:30,190

going this way like this way yeah the

2114
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:30,200
going this way like this way yeah the
 

2115
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:35,109
going this way like this way yeah the
way we go X doesn't move a centimeter at

2116
00:55:35,109 --> 00:55:35,119
way we go X doesn't move a centimeter at
 

2117
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:37,710
way we go X doesn't move a centimeter at
all what I'm

2118
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:37,720
all what I'm
 

2119
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:42,069
all what I'm
trying I I still believe in you I

2120
00:55:42,069 --> 00:55:42,079
trying I I still believe in you I
 

2121
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:44,069
trying I I still believe in you I
believe you can you can take us the

2122
00:55:44,069 --> 00:55:44,079
believe you can you can take us the
 

2123
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:45,910
believe you can you can take us the
right direction let's just figure it out

2124
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:45,920
right direction let's just figure it out
 

2125
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,710
right direction let's just figure it out
okay at the very least we're going the

2126
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:47,720
okay at the very least we're going the
 

2127
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:52,230
okay at the very least we're going the
right Z direction right X Direction X

2128
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:52,240
right Z direction right X Direction X
 

2129
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,630
right Z direction right X Direction X
direction we have to go this way like no

2130
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:54,640
direction we have to go this way like no
 

2131
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,430
direction we have to go this way like no
X I mean that's fine once you get get

2132
00:55:56,430 --> 00:55:56,440
X I mean that's fine once you get get
 

2133
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:59,230
X I mean that's fine once you get get
out you can like go that way but the Z

2134
00:55:59,230 --> 00:55:59,240
out you can like go that way but the Z
 

2135
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:00,630
out you can like go that way but the Z
direction is really

2136
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:00,640
direction is really
 

2137
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:03,549
direction is really
important wait

2138
00:56:03,549 --> 00:56:03,559
important wait
 

2139
00:56:03,559 --> 00:56:05,230
important wait
