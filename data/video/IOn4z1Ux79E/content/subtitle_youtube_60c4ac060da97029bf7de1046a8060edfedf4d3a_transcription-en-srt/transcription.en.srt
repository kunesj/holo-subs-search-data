yeah she's raiding an npc place right
 

2387
02:22:44,160 --> 02:22:54,309
yeah she's raiding an npc place right
now

2388
02:22:54,309 --> 02:22:54,319

 

2389
02:22:54,319 --> 02:22:56,950

02:23:12,469 --> 02:23:12,479

 

2393
02:23:12,479 --> 02:23:59,030

so

2394
02:23:59,030 --> 02:23:59,040

 

2395
02:23:59,040 --> 02:24:18,150

just gonna be watching from the window

2396
02:24:18,150 --> 02:24:18,160

 

2397
02:24:18,160 --> 02:24:29,030

that wouldn't be cool

2398
02:24:29,030 --> 02:24:29,040

 

2399
02:24:29,040 --> 02:24:46,630

um

2400
02:24:46,630 --> 02:24:46,640

 

2401
02:24:46,640 --> 02:24:48,630

if they are waiting for me they should

2402
02:24:48,630 --> 02:24:48,640
if they are waiting for me they should
 

2403
02:24:48,640 --> 02:25:06,469
if they are waiting for me they should
be waiting from over that direction

2404
02:25:06,469 --> 02:25:06,479

 

2405
02:25:06,479 --> 02:25:18,550

2407
02:25:18,560 --> 02:25:32,469

so

2408
02:25:32,469 --> 02:25:32,479

 

2409
02:25:32,479 --> 02:25:40,790

02:25:43,429 --> 02:25:43,439
and we should probably wait until
 

2413
02:25:43,439 --> 02:25:50,550
and we should probably wait until
nighttime

2414
02:25:50,550 --> 02:25:50,560

 

2415
02:25:50,560 --> 02:25:53,590
