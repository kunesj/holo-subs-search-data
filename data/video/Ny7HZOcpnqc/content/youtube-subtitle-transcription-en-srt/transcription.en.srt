what part of my brain am I using right

1200
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:41,760
what part of my brain am I using right
 

1201

all of it

1206
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:53,220
all of it
 

1207
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,789
all of it
um we have green green

1208
00:33:55,789 --> 00:33:55,799
um we have green green
 

1209
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:59,750
um we have green green
as the majority so I would say

1210
00:33:59,750 --> 00:33:59,760
as the majority so I would say
 

1211
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,590
as the majority so I would say
that we filled the the LA the yeah that

1212
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:03,600
that we filled the the LA the yeah that
 

1213
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,509
that we filled the the LA the yeah that
one with green first then we can finish

1214
00:34:05,509 --> 00:34:05,519
one with green first then we can finish
 

1215
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,810
one with green first then we can finish
the red one already we can bring all the

1216
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:08,820
the red one already we can bring all the
 

1217
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:13,690

maybe I was too smart for them I
 

1227
00:34:26,339 --> 00:34:28,369

probably what is this it this is like
 

1231
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,690
probably what is this it this is like
way easier than the other things I've

1232
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:32,700
way easier than the other things I've
 

1233
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,710
way easier than the other things I've
done so far

1234
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:35,720

 

1235
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:39,770

if they were teaching this at school
 

1241
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:51,109
if they were teaching this at school
yeah then I would have had no issues

1242

would think there's inflation but simply

1748
00:46:18,890 --> 00:46:18,900
would think there's inflation but simply
 

1749
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,630
would think there's inflation but simply
because there's more choice of

1750
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:20,640
because there's more choice of
 

1751
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,370
because there's more choice of
connections I suppose

1752
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:22,380
connections I suppose
 

1753
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,589
connections I suppose
and more choices of airlines that fly

1754
00:46:24,589 --> 00:46:24,599

but
 

4807
02:09:42,420 --> 02:09:44,990
but
I wonder if it matters like if the small

4808
02:09:44,990 --> 02:09:45,000
I wonder if it matters like if the small
 

4809
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,570
I wonder if it matters like if the small
numbers matter

4810
02:09:47,570 --> 02:09:47,580
numbers matter
 

4811
02:09:47,580 --> 02:09:51,040
numbers matter
750

4812
02:09:51,040 --> 02:09:51,050

hey is it good to divide early

4816
02:09:56,209 --> 02:09:56,219

 

4817
02:09:56,219 --> 02:10:00,229

so maybe now

4818
02:10:00,229 --> 02:10:00,239

 

4819
02:10:00,239 --> 02:10:02,270

okay that's still enough

4820
02:10:02,270 --> 02:10:02,280
okay that's still enough
 

4821
02:10:02,280 --> 02:10:03,300
okay that's still enough
okay

4822
02:10:03,300 --> 02:10:03,310
okay
 

4823
02:10:03,310 --> 02:10:08,330

and then

4826
02:10:10,010 --> 02:10:10,020
and then
 

4827
02:10:10,020 --> 02:10:13,930
and then
take the multiplication at the very end

4828
02:10:13,930 --> 02:10:13,940
take the multiplication at the very end
 

4829
02:10:13,940 --> 02:10:17,149
take the multiplication at the very end
whoa whoa and we're we're not quite

4830
02:10:17,149 --> 02:10:17,159
whoa whoa and we're we're not quite
 

4831
02:10:17,159 --> 02:10:20,629
whoa whoa and we're we're not quite
ready for the top yet but easy

4832
02:10:20,629 --> 02:10:20,639
ready for the top yet but easy
 

4833
02:10:20,639 --> 02:10:23,330
ready for the top yet but easy
I'm looking at how much it adds up to at

4834
02:10:23,330 --> 02:10:23,340
I'm looking at how much it adds up to at
 

4835
02:10:23,340 --> 02:10:27,709
I'm looking at how much it adds up to at
the end seems like I could have chosen

4836
02:10:27,709 --> 02:10:27,719
the end seems like I could have chosen
 

4837
02:10:27,719 --> 02:10:32,030
the end seems like I could have chosen
almost any of the enemies before first

4838
02:10:32,030 --> 02:10:32,040
almost any of the enemies before first
 

4839
02:10:32,040 --> 02:10:33,290
almost any of the enemies before first
no

4840
02:10:33,290 --> 02:10:33,300
no
 

4841
02:10:33,300 --> 02:10:35,270
no
or maybe not I don't I actually don't

4842
02:10:35,270 --> 02:10:35,280
or maybe not I don't I actually don't
 

4843
02:10:35,280 --> 02:10:36,229
or maybe not I don't I actually don't
know

4844
02:10:36,229 --> 02:10:36,239
know
 

4845
02:10:36,239 --> 02:10:38,209
know
but we kill

4846
02:10:38,209 --> 02:10:38,219
but we kill
 

4847
02:10:38,219 --> 02:10:40,729
but we kill
devil

4848
02:10:40,729 --> 02:10:40,739
devil
 

4849
02:10:40,739 --> 02:10:45,010
devil
the devil is himself

4850
02:10:45,010 --> 02:10:45,020

 

4851
02:10:45,020 --> 02:10:48,290

okay that wasn't so difficult still

4852
02:10:48,290 --> 02:10:48,300
okay that wasn't so difficult still
 

4853
02:10:48,300 --> 02:10:56,650
okay that wasn't so difficult still
I can handle that let's go to 36.

4854
02:10:56,650 --> 02:10:56,660

4859
02:11:03,980 --> 02:11:08,629

13 is not an issue how about with divide

4860
02:11:08,629 --> 02:11:08,639
13 is not an issue how about with divide
 

4861
02:11:08,639 --> 02:11:13,370
13 is not an issue how about with divide
wait let's do minus six first

4862
02:11:13,370 --> 02:11:13,380
wait let's do minus six first
 

4863
02:11:13,380 --> 02:11:15,830
wait let's do minus six first
and then divide

4864
02:11:15,830 --> 02:11:15,840
and then divide
 

4865
02:11:15,840 --> 02:11:18,890
and then divide
to so that we get to 32.

4866
02:11:18,890 --> 02:11:18,900
to so that we get to 32.
 

4867
02:11:18,900 --> 02:11:21,290
to so that we get to 32.
do you guys think that was smart yeah

4868
02:11:21,290 --> 02:11:21,300
do you guys think that was smart yeah
 

4869
02:11:21,300 --> 02:11:22,810
do you guys think that was smart yeah
okay

4870
02:11:22,810 --> 02:11:22,820
okay
 

4871
02:11:22,820 --> 02:11:27,390
okay
now we can take care of this one

4872
02:11:27,390 --> 02:11:27,400

 

4873
02:11:27,400 --> 02:11:28,669

02:11:32,870 --> 02:11:32,880

 

4877
02:11:32,880 --> 02:11:38,030

thank you thank you thank you

4878
02:11:38,030 --> 02:11:38,040

 

4879
02:11:38,040 --> 02:11:40,490

I don't even think that far ahead

4880
02:11:40,490 --> 02:11:40,500
I don't even think that far ahead
 

4881
02:11:40,500 --> 02:11:43,609
I don't even think that far ahead
but uh it seems to have worked 170 is

4882
02:11:43,609 --> 02:11:43,619
but uh it seems to have worked 170 is
 

4883
02:11:43,619 --> 02:11:47,330
but uh it seems to have worked 170 is
what we're dealing with okay

4884
02:11:47,330 --> 02:11:47,340

 

4885
02:11:47,340 --> 02:11:50,149

um maybe minus 30 maybe the same way

4886
02:11:50,149 --> 02:11:50,159
um maybe minus 30 maybe the same way
 

4887
02:11:50,159 --> 02:11:54,530
um maybe minus 30 maybe the same way
first the minus standard divided

4888
02:11:54,530 --> 02:11:54,540

 

4889
02:11:54,540 --> 02:11:57,410

because we want to divide the the

4890
02:11:57,410 --> 02:11:57,420
because we want to divide the the
 

4891
02:11:57,420 --> 02:12:00,950
because we want to divide the the
smallest amount possible Right

4892
02:12:00,950 --> 02:12:00,960
smallest amount possible Right
 

4893
02:12:00,960 --> 02:12:03,830
smallest amount possible Right
probably

4894
02:12:03,830 --> 02:12:03,840
probably
 

4895
02:12:03,840 --> 02:12:07,990
probably
right yeah same logic okay

4896
02:12:07,990 --> 02:12:08,000

 

4897
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:09,729

wow
wow not so stupid Wawa after all

02:12:14,629 --> 02:12:14,639
wow not so stupid Wawa after all
 

4901
02:12:14,639 --> 02:12:18,650

4906
02:12:25,669 --> 02:12:25,679

 

4907
02:12:25,679 --> 02:12:29,209

good with this game

4908
02:12:29,209 --> 02:12:29,219
good with this game

02:12:29,219 --> 02:12:32,030

I like it okay here's some big ass

4910
02:12:32,030 --> 02:12:32,040
I like it okay here's some big ass
 

4911
02:12:32,040 --> 02:12:36,169
I like it okay here's some big ass
numbers oh I start with 246 okay well

4912
02:12:36,169 --> 02:12:36,179
numbers oh I start with 246 okay well
 

4913
02:12:36,179 --> 02:12:37,910
numbers oh I start with 246 okay well
then obviously I gotta take this one

4914
02:12:37,910 --> 02:12:37,920
then obviously I gotta take this one
 

4915
02:12:37,920 --> 02:12:38,950
then obviously I gotta take this one
first

4916
02:12:38,950 --> 02:12:38,960
first

02:12:48,709 --> 02:12:48,719

 

4921
02:12:48,719 --> 02:12:51,770

just gotta build up some numbers first

4922
02:12:51,770 --> 02:12:51,780
just gotta build up some numbers first
 

4923
02:12:51,780 --> 02:12:56,209
just gotta build up some numbers first
and then we got 1200 and then a divided

4924
02:12:56,209 --> 02:12:56,219
and then we got 1200 and then a divided
 

4925
02:12:56,219 --> 02:12:59,689
and then we got 1200 and then a divided
by three divided by 2 and 838

4926
02:12:59,689 --> 02:12:59,699
by three divided by 2 and 838
 

4927
02:12:59,699 --> 02:13:01,370
by three divided by 2 and 838
wow

4928
02:13:01,370 --> 02:13:01,380
wow
 

4929
02:13:01,380 --> 02:13:06,229
wow
but we want to divide early on

4930
02:13:06,229 --> 02:13:06,239
but we want to divide early on
 

4931
02:13:06,239 --> 02:13:08,390
but we want to divide early on
I think

4932
02:13:08,390 --> 02:13:08,400
I think
 

4933
02:13:08,400 --> 02:13:11,209
I think
I think

4934
02:13:11,209 --> 02:13:11,219
I think
 

4935
02:13:11,219 --> 02:13:13,129
I think
wait I could take the devil right now

4936
02:13:13,129 --> 02:13:13,139
wait I could take the devil right now
 

4937
02:13:13,139 --> 02:13:14,450
wait I could take the devil right now
even

4938
02:13:14,450 --> 02:13:14,460
even
 

4939
02:13:14,460 --> 02:13:16,790
even
actually

4940
02:13:16,790 --> 02:13:16,800
actually
 

4941
02:13:16,800 --> 02:13:18,530
actually
maybe I do that first because I don't

4942
02:13:18,530 --> 02:13:18,540
maybe I do that first because I don't
 

4943
02:13:18,540 --> 02:13:21,589
maybe I do that first because I don't
know if I'll still have enough

4944
02:13:21,589 --> 02:13:21,599
know if I'll still have enough
 

4945
02:13:21,599 --> 02:13:23,629
know if I'll still have enough
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah

4946
02:13:23,629 --> 02:13:23,639
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
 

4947
02:13:23,639 --> 02:13:26,030
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah okay okay

4948
02:13:26,030 --> 02:13:26,040
yeah yeah okay okay
 

4949
02:13:26,040 --> 02:13:27,770
yeah yeah okay okay
I didn't look closely so I didn't

4950
02:13:27,770 --> 02:13:27,780
I didn't look closely so I didn't
 

4951
02:13:27,780 --> 02:13:31,689
I didn't look closely so I didn't
realize I had enough to catch the devil

4952
02:13:31,689 --> 02:13:31,699
realize I had enough to catch the devil
 

4953
02:13:31,699 --> 02:13:36,229
realize I had enough to catch the devil
but maybe now I should divide

4954
02:13:36,229 --> 02:13:36,239
but maybe now I should divide
 

4955
02:13:36,239 --> 02:13:39,550
but maybe now I should divide
so

4956
02:13:39,550 --> 02:13:39,560

 

4957
02:13:39,560 --> 02:13:43,310

half of two thousand

4958
02:13:43,310 --> 02:13:43,320
half of two thousand
 

4959
02:13:43,320 --> 02:13:46,810
half of two thousand
500 is like one thousand

4960
02:13:46,810 --> 02:13:46,820
500 is like one thousand
 

4961
02:13:46,820 --> 02:13:49,550
500 is like one thousand
250 right

4962
02:13:49,550 --> 02:13:49,560
250 right
 

4963
02:13:49,560 --> 02:13:52,550
250 right
so that's still enough

4964
02:13:52,550 --> 02:13:52,560
so that's still enough
 

4965
02:13:52,560 --> 02:13:55,729
so that's still enough
should I divide by three

4966
02:13:55,729 --> 02:13:55,739
should I divide by three
 

4967
02:13:55,739 --> 02:14:00,350
should I divide by three
okay

4968
02:14:00,350 --> 02:14:00,360

 

4969
02:14:00,360 --> 02:14:05,209

okay that is very close

4970
02:14:05,209 --> 02:14:05,219
okay that is very close
 

4971
02:14:05,219 --> 02:14:08,629
okay that is very close
um

4972
02:14:08,629 --> 02:14:08,639

 

4973
02:14:08,639 --> 02:14:12,109

and then for two

4974
02:14:12,109 --> 02:14:12,119
and then for two
 

4975
02:14:12,119 --> 02:14:15,850
and then for two
okay we have to end up with 636 at least

4976
02:14:15,850 --> 02:14:15,860
okay we have to end up with 636 at least
 

4977
02:14:15,860 --> 02:14:18,050
okay we have to end up with 636 at least
647 I guess

4978
02:14:18,050 --> 02:14:18,060
647 I guess
 

4979
02:14:18,060 --> 02:14:21,649
647 I guess
