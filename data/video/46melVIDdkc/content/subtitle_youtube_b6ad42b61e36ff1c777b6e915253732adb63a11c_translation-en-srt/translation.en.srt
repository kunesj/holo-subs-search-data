00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,730

There aren't many

726
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:22,740

 

727
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:26,270

Let's increase

728
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:26,280

 

729
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:31,610

It's a slow starter to go out there.

730
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:31,620

 

731
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:36,830

I hear a voice when I wake up

732
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:36,840

Ah, cherry blossoms are fine, okay?

736
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:47,520
Ah, cherry blossoms are fine, okay?

745
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:04,130

Is your voice cute when you wake up?

746
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:04,140
Is your voice cute when you wake up?
 

747
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:17,470
Is your voice cute when you wake up?
I don't like it when I hear about it later.

748
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:17,480

 

749
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:23,090

Too sloppy

750
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:23,100

 

751
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:28,210

What will happen?

752
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:28,220

 

753
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:31,850

It's not rough, so it's okay.

754
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:31,860
It's not rough, so it's okay.
 

755
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:35,330
It's not rough, so it's okay.
Maybe it's not the rough type

756
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:35,340
Maybe it's not the rough type
 

757
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:39,770
Maybe it's not the rough type
Should I add a little more?

758
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:39,780

 

759
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,930

I'm sure I'll lose, so I'll put in more.

760
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:41,940
I'm sure I'll lose, so I'll put in more.
 

761
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:49,010
I'm sure I'll lose, so I'll put in more.
Gahaha

762
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:49,020

 

763
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:53,450

Let's include this one too.

You're doing it

You're doing it
 

773
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,750
You're doing it

774
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:11,760

 

775
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:18,169

I'm doing it

776

777
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:22,669

It's not a good lie

778

It's unfair

786
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:33,900
It's unfair

00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:49,450

Right?

793
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:55,190

You're here again. It sounds like a song.

You're here again. It sounds like a song.

That's great, that's strange. We lost again.

00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:07,430

If it shines too much, it's weird, but this is bright.

1091
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:52,790

That's what I think

1092
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:52,800

 

1093
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,329

Anything that says it will be republished from now on is fine.

1094
00:35:56,329 --> 00:35:56,339
Anything that says it will be republished from now on is fine.
 

1095
00:35:56,339 --> 00:36:00,650
Anything that says it will be republished from now on is fine.
I wonder if

1096
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:00,660

 

1097
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:04,609

Is this it?

1098
00:36:04,609 --> 00:36:04,619

 

1099
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:08,329

That thing

1100
00:36:08,329 --> 00:36:08,339

 

1101
00:36:08,339 --> 00:36:15,710

roger that

1102
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:15,720

 

1103
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:19,849

Let's save this

1104
00:36:19,849 --> 00:36:19,859

 

1105
00:36:19,859 --> 00:36:24,410

Finally Lamb Vegas

1106
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:24,420

 

1107
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:29,150

Should I make it?

1108
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:29,160

 

1109
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,750

1110
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:31,760

1111
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:39,170

overwrite it

1112
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:39,180

 

1113
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,210

OK

1114
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:40,220
OK
 

1115
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:47,770
OK
Finally the casino

1116
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:47,780

 

1117
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:51,170

It's tough

1118
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:51,180

 

1119
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:54,530

Because it's Hiro

1120
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:54,540

 

1121
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:59,329

It's probably difficult

1122
00:36:59,329 --> 00:36:59,339

 

1123
00:36:59,339 --> 00:37:03,170

Okay

1124
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:03,180

1129
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:15,710

I wonder if I'll break it down

00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:15,720

 

1131
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,230

1133
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,550

It smells like a big smell

1134
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:22,560

5259
03:15:57,000 --> 03:16:05,870

Uncle, are you going out?

5260
03:16:05,870 --> 03:16:05,880

 

5261
03:16:05,880 --> 03:16:11,389

Are you closed?

5262
03:16:11,389 --> 03:16:11,399

 

5263
03:16:11,399 --> 03:16:20,210

After all, everyone is 20.

5264
03:16:20,210 --> 03:16:20,220

 

5265
03:16:20,220 --> 03:16:24,110

South 10 steps

5266
03:16:24,110 --> 03:16:24,120

 

5267
03:16:24,120 --> 03:16:27,410

5269
03:16:27,420 --> 03:16:35,750

What's up with the raid passing away in the update?

5270
03:16:35,750 --> 03:16:35,760

 

5271
03:16:35,760 --> 03:16:38,150

I should be lucky

5272
03:16:38,150 --> 03:16:38,160

Hmm, only one person was killed.

Hmm, only one person was killed.

Hmm, only one person was killed.

It's not her place.

5288
03:17:06,830 --> 03:17:06,840
It's not her place.
 

5289
03:17:06,840 --> 03:17:09,710
It's not her place.
What is a fishing pond?

5291
03:17:09,720 --> 03:17:13,870

Which fishing hole are you referring to?

5292
03:17:13,870 --> 03:17:13,880
Which fishing hole are you referring to?

I guess it was this one

5300
03:17:32,990 --> 03:17:33,000

 

5301
03:17:33,000 --> 03:17:35,929

I'm about to leave

03:18:14,210 --> 03:18:14,220

 

5315
03:18:14,220 --> 03:18:19,790

I wonder if I can get out here?

5316
03:18:19,790 --> 03:18:19,800

 

5317
03:18:19,800 --> 03:18:22,969

Is it okay if I get this?

5318
03:18:22,969 --> 03:18:22,979
Is it okay if I get this?
 

5319
03:18:22,979 --> 03:18:27,110
Is it okay if I get this?
I don't know if it's something I should get.

5320
03:18:27,110 --> 03:18:27,120
I don't know if it's something I should get.
 

5321
03:18:27,120 --> 03:18:40,849
I don't know if it's something I should get.
It's free. What's here is free.

It's bad if I don't sleep.

5328

5329
03:19:08,640 --> 03:19:11,570

Can you sleep?

5330

5331
03:19:11,580 --> 03:19:21,110

Hey

I can't sleep

5335
03:19:25,920 --> 03:19:44,750

I guess it'll be okay if I stay in bed for now.

5337
03:19:44,760 --> 03:19:55,670

I wonder if it's okay to sleep until 93?

5338
03:19:55,670 --> 03:19:55,680

 

5339
03:19:55,680 --> 03:20:02,050

I'm probably working on it. Is it okay?

03:20:09,779 --> 03:20:14,630

Even though I slept with Mr. Q, I still slept with Shinsaba at night.
I wonder if it won't happen?

I stole three things

5388

5389
03:22:21,300 --> 03:22:25,250

Isn't it Erobo-chan's?

5391
03:22:25,260 --> 03:22:30,490

5393
03:22:30,500 --> 03:22:45,190

Isn't it?

5394
03:22:45,190 --> 03:22:45,200

 

5395
03:22:45,200 --> 03:22:48,230

The one that Matsuri-chan and porridge caught.

5396
03:22:48,230 --> 03:22:48,240

It seems like it should be

5399
03:22:52,200 --> 03:22:58,010

I put it in because I don't really use it.

5400
03:22:58,010 --> 03:22:58,020

 

5401
03:22:58,020 --> 03:23:00,710

I haven't put my likes and dislikes in, so I guess that's it.

5402
03:23:00,710 --> 03:23:00,720
I haven't put my likes and dislikes in, so I guess that's it.

I wonder if Kana is okay?
 

5405
03:23:03,979 --> 03:23:08,330
I wonder if Kana is okay?
Well then, what do you mean by sending it?

5406
03:23:08,330 --> 03:23:08,340
Well then, what do you mean by sending it?
 

5407
03:23:08,340 --> 03:23:22,910
Well then, what do you mean by sending it?
It looks like it will be. Well then, that's fine.

5409
03:23:22,920 --> 03:23:26,870

It's okay, I need a pot, so I'll bring it home.

There are so many endermen here, why are they like this?

Is it a comfortable place to live?
 

6037
03:49:32,580 --> 03:49:38,210
Is it a comfortable place to live?
Because the house is big

6038
03:49:38,210 --> 03:49:38,220

 

6039
03:49:38,220 --> 03:49:44,929

I'm afraid this is ok

6107
03:54:48,560 --> 03:54:58,630

It was like a broadcasting accident.

6108
03:54:58,630 --> 03:54:58,640

 

6109
03:54:58,640 --> 03:55:03,490

I washed my hands

6110
03:55:03,490 --> 03:55:03,500

 

6111
03:55:03,500 --> 03:55:07,969

As expected, there is nothing that Oyasumiyama does not have.

6112
03:55:07,969 --> 03:55:07,979
As expected, there is nothing that Oyasumiyama does not have.

But

6114
03:55:11,330 --> 03:55:11,340

 

6115
03:55:11,340 --> 03:55:16,070

There are times when it's dangerous

03:55:16,070 --> 03:55:16,080

 

6117
03:55:16,080 --> 03:55:22,450

6119
03:55:22,460 --> 03:55:27,110

Sometimes

6120
03:55:27,110 --> 03:55:27,120

 

6121
03:55:27,120 --> 03:55:30,530

If you don't make it in time, you'll have to go home.

6122
03:55:30,530 --> 03:55:30,540
If you don't make it in time, you'll have to go home.
 

6123

03:55:37,620 --> 03:55:43,130

Various things are bad

03:55:43,130 --> 03:55:43,140

 

6127
03:55:43,140 --> 03:55:46,450

It's really a broadcasting accident.

It's quite difficult when you think about it

You can't do it, right?
