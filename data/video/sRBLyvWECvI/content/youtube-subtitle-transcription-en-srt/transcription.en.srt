thing we can do is maybe uh
 

937
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,549
thing we can do is maybe uh
the number of locks maybe get them down

938
00:29:00,549 --> 00:29:00,559
the number of locks maybe get them down
 

939

if anybody wanted to

948
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:15,760

 

949
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,230

stuff right yes but you find it's really

950
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:18,240
stuff right yes but you find it's really
 

951
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,909
stuff right yes but you find it's really
easy to find the stuff to build

952
00:29:19,909 --> 00:29:19,919
easy to find the stuff to build
 

953
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,630
easy to find the stuff to build
oh okay i'll be i'll be an adventure kid

954
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:22,640
oh okay i'll be i'll be an adventure kid
 

955
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,350
oh okay i'll be i'll be an adventure kid
then

956
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:23,360
then
 

957
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,269
then
maybe we should also turn off key cards

958
00:29:25,269 --> 00:29:25,279
maybe we should also turn off key cards
 

959
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,510
maybe we should also turn off key cards
so we can go straight to the keys

960
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:27,520
so we can go straight to the keys
 

961
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,269
so we can go straight to the keys
ah yeah yeah

962
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:31,279
ah yeah yeah
 

963
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,149
ah yeah yeah
we'll see how it goes okay i think that

964
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:34,159
we'll see how it goes okay i think that
 

965
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:35,909
we'll see how it goes okay i think that
makes it a bit easier for us to win

966
00:29:35,909 --> 00:29:35,919
makes it a bit easier for us to win
 

967
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,909
makes it a bit easier for us to win
because other than that i think we were

968
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:37,919
because other than that i think we were
 

969
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,549
because other than that i think we were
it was impossible for us to win yeah

970
00:29:40,549 --> 00:29:40,559
it was impossible for us to win yeah
 

971
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,350
