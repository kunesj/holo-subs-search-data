aquarium would look so cool up there
 

5419

02:33:21,030 --> 02:33:21,040
and the
 

5429
02:33:21,040 --> 02:33:23,670
and the

5437
02:33:29,359 --> 02:33:42,550
let's see if i've learned from my
mistakes

5438
02:33:42,550 --> 02:33:42,560

 

5439
02:33:42,560 --> 02:33:44,150

okay whatever i wanted to use the shield

5440

but i'm too stupid to do it yet um
 

5443
02:33:46,840 --> 02:33:49,510
but i'm too stupid to do it yet um
um yeah uh

5444
02:33:49,510 --> 02:33:49,520
um yeah uh
 

5445
02:33:49,520 --> 02:33:51,270
um yeah uh
and it would be uh

5446
02:33:51,270 --> 02:33:51,280
and it would be uh
 

5447
02:33:51,280 --> 02:33:54,150
and it would be uh
it would be probably cool for

5448
02:33:54,150 --> 02:33:54,160
it would be probably cool for
 

5449
02:33:54,160 --> 02:33:56,230
it would be probably cool for
the kids the children

5450
02:33:56,230 --> 02:33:56,240
the kids the children
 

5451
02:33:56,240 --> 02:33:58,469
the kids the children
the the kitty cats as well

5452
02:33:58,469 --> 02:33:58,479
the the kitty cats as well
 

5453
02:33:58,479 --> 02:34:00,630
the the kitty cats as well
you know

5454
02:34:00,630 --> 02:34:00,640
you know
 

5455
02:34:00,640 --> 02:34:02,389
you know
um but

5456
02:34:02,389 --> 02:34:02,399
um but
 

5457
02:34:02,399 --> 02:34:07,910
um but
then i was a bit worried that maybe uh

5458
02:34:07,910 --> 02:34:07,920

 

5459
02:34:07,920 --> 02:34:09,750

maybe

5460
02:34:09,750 --> 02:34:09,760
maybe
 

5461
02:34:09,760 --> 02:34:12,230
maybe
an aquarium is a bit too high level to

03:59:16,960 --> 03:59:18,550
no using that wouldn't be enough to
level up right

8784
03:59:18,550 --> 03:59:18,560
level up right
 

8785
03:59:18,560 --> 03:59:21,349
level up right
and i would probably just lose it

8786
03:59:21,349 --> 03:59:21,359
and i would probably just lose it
 

8787
03:59:21,359 --> 03:59:23,670
