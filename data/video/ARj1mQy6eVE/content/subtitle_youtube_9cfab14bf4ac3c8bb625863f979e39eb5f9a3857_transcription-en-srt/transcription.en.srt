7158
03:35:12,790 --> 03:35:12,800

7162
03:35:24,189 --> 03:35:24,199

 

7163
03:35:24,199 --> 03:35:26,910

principles yeah so for example the

7164
03:35:26,910 --> 03:35:26,920
principles yeah so for example the
 

7165
03:35:26,920 --> 03:35:29,030
principles yeah so for example the
windmills I would probably renew my

7166
03:35:29,030 --> 03:35:29,040
windmills I would probably renew my
 

7167
03:35:29,040 --> 03:35:31,710

than yeah I would have to
 

12877
06:21:34,360 --> 06:21:39,310
than yeah I would have to
sleep like if I want to stream any prime

12878
06:21:39,310 --> 06:21:39,320

 

12879
06:21:39,320 --> 06:21:42,548

time i' even have to get up like super

12880
06:21:42,548 --> 06:21:42,558
time i' even have to get up like super
 

12881
06:21:42,558 --> 06:21:45,070
time i' even have to get up like super
early but then even then if I get up at

12882
06:21:45,070 --> 06:21:45,080
early but then even then if I get up at
 

12883
06:21:45,080 --> 06:21:47,788
early but then even then if I get up at
600 and start streaming at 700 or

12884
06:21:47,788 --> 06:21:47,798
600 and start streaming at 700 or
 

12885
06:21:47,798 --> 06:21:52,110
600 and start streaming at 700 or
so then I can't really do like I

12886
06:21:52,110 --> 06:21:52,120
so then I can't really do like I
 

12887
06:21:52,120 --> 06:21:54,548
so then I can't really do like I
wouldn't be in prime time for long cuz

12888
06:21:54,548 --> 06:21:54,558
wouldn't be in prime time for long cuz
 

12889
06:21:54,558 --> 06:21:56,310
wouldn't be in prime time for long cuz
like

12890
06:21:56,310 --> 06:21:56,320
like
 

12891
06:21:56,320 --> 06:21:58,990
like
uh if I do a longer stream it will go

12892
06:21:58,990 --> 06:21:59,000
uh if I do a longer stream it will go
 

12893
06:21:59,000 --> 06:22:01,390
uh if I do a longer stream it will go
through the night yeah cuz that's

12894
06:22:01,390 --> 06:22:01,400
through the night yeah cuz that's
 

12895
06:22:01,400 --> 06:22:03,270
through the night yeah cuz that's
already 1:00 a.m. you see that's not

12896
06:22:03,270 --> 06:22:03,280
already 1:00 a.m. you see that's not
 

12897
06:22:03,280 --> 06:22:05,430
