00:00:00,351 --> 00:00:01,018
​​​ ​Fun fact:​ ​​

2
00:00:01,018 --> 00:00:04,555
​​​ ​In Australia, we only have​ ​​
​​ ​the grades 1 to 5,​ ​​

3
00:00:04,555 --> 00:00:06,190
​​​ ​and in Germany,​ ​​

4
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,425
​​​ ​they have the grades 1 to 6.​ ​​

5
00:00:10,027 --> 00:00:11,328
​​​ ​Where is the rest of 'em?​ ​​

6
00:00:11,328 --> 00:00:12,529
​​​ ​Where is 3-4?​ ​​

7
00:00:13,163 --> 00:00:14,064
​​​ ​Eh?​ ​​

8
00:00:14,064 --> 00:00:15,466
​​​ ​1-2-6.​ ​​

9
00:00:15,466 --> 00:00:16,667
​​​ ​1-2-5...​ ​​

10
00:00:17,735 --> 00:00:19,036
​​​ ​1-2-3...​ ​​

11
00:00:17,735 --> 00:00:19,036
​​​ ​Gura...​ ​​

12
00:00:19,036 --> 00:00:20,270
​​​ ​Huh?​ ​​

13
00:00:22,139 --> 00:00:24,775
​​​ ​You didn't say 3, 4!​ ​​

14
00:00:28,078 --> 00:00:29,580
​​​ ​Wait, did I mess up?​ ​​

15
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:35,252
​​​ ​I'm crying!​ ​​

16
00:00:36,053 --> 00:00:37,888
​​​ ​Wait, what... What happened?​ ​​

17
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:38,956
​​​ ​Okay, so...​ ​​

18
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:40,157
​​​ ​It means that we have in—​ ​​

19
00:00:40,157 --> 00:00:43,794
​​​ ​In Australia, we have the grades​ ​​

20
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:44,762
​​​ ​1,​ ​​

21
00:00:44,762 --> 00:00:45,729
​​​ ​2,​ ​​

22
00:00:45,729 --> 00:00:46,730

00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:47,598
​​​ ​4,​ ​​

24
00:00:47,598 --> 00:00:48,565
​​​ ​5.​ ​​

25
00:00:48,565 --> 00:00:51,535
​​​ ​Which is "1 to 5."​ ​​

26
00:01:05,949 --> 00:01:08,585
​​​ ​Gura, how would you even​ ​​
​​ ​get such a stupid idea?!​ ​​

27
00:01:08,585 --> 00:01:10,354
​​​ ​That's so ridiculous!​ ​​

28
00:01:12,256 --> 00:01:13,857
​​​ ​I don't know...​ ​​
