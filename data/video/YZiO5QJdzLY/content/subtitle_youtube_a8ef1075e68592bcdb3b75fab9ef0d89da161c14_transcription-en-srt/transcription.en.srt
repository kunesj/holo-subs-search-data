at least you know are still alive but we
can't rule out

3386
01:48:14,950 --> 01:48:14,960

 

3387
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:16,709

we also didn't have ghost orbs though so

3388
01:48:16,709 --> 01:48:16,719
we also didn't have ghost orbs though so
 

3389
01:48:16,719 --> 01:48:18,390
we also didn't have ghost orbs though so
with the evidence that we have the only

3390
01:48:18,390 --> 01:48:18,400
with the evidence that we have the only
 

3391
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:20,149
with the evidence that we have the only
other thing that we could find is ghost

3392
01:48:20,149 --> 01:48:20,159
other thing that we could find is ghost
 

3393
01:48:20,159 --> 01:48:22,229
other thing that we could find is ghost
orbs or ghost writing

3394
01:48:22,229 --> 01:48:22,239
orbs or ghost writing
 

3395
01:48:22,239 --> 01:48:26,390

because we don't have uh we don't have
 

3399
01:48:28,400 --> 01:48:30,390
because we don't have uh we don't have
words we don't have the freezing and we

3400
01:48:30,390 --> 01:48:30,400
words we don't have the freezing and we
 

3401
01:48:30,400 --> 01:48:33,189
words we don't have the freezing and we
don't have the emf level five

3402
