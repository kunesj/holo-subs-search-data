03:25:44,030 --> 03:25:44,040
I practiced and I tried to understand my
 

7212
03:25:44,040 --> 03:25:47,030
I practiced and I tried to understand my
cards and even though you might not

7213
03:25:47,030 --> 03:25:47,040
cards and even though you might not
 

7214
03:25:47,040 --> 03:25:50,469
cards and even though you might not
think that way but I I really um always

7215
03:25:50,469 --> 03:25:50,479
think that way but I I really um always
 

7216
03:25:50,479 --> 03:25:53,469
think that way but I I really um always
like tried doing the right thing I

7217
03:25:53,469 --> 03:25:53,479
like tried doing the right thing I
 

7218
03:25:53,479 --> 03:25:57,309
like tried doing the right thing I
didn't just play C cards

7219
03:25:57,309 --> 03:25:57,319
didn't just play C cards
 

7220
03:25:57,319 --> 03:26:00,309
didn't just play C cards
randomly I was trying to think things

7221
03:26:00,309 --> 03:26:00,319
randomly I was trying to think things
 

7222
03:26:00,319 --> 03:26:03,830
randomly I was trying to think things
through and uh read my cards and

7223
03:26:03,830 --> 03:26:03,840
through and uh read my cards and
 

7224
03:26:03,840 --> 03:26:05,550
through and uh read my cards and
understand them and mostly I understood

7225
03:26:05,550 --> 03:26:05,560
understand them and mostly I understood
 

7226
03:26:05,560 --> 03:26:07,389
understand them and mostly I understood
them like I knew what my cards were

7227
03:26:07,389 --> 03:26:07,399
them like I knew what my cards were
 

7228
03:26:07,399 --> 03:26:09,790
them like I knew what my cards were
doing I KN I knew the basic game

7229
03:26:09,790 --> 03:26:09,800
doing I KN I knew the basic game
 

7230
03:26:09,800 --> 03:26:12,189
doing I KN I knew the basic game
mechanics and all that so it was

7231
03:26:12,189 --> 03:26:12,199
mechanics and all that so it was
 

7232
03:26:12,199 --> 03:26:14,349
mechanics and all that so it was
definitely a big improvement from like

7233
03:26:14,349 --> 03:26:14,359
definitely a big improvement from like
 

7234
03:26:14,359 --> 03:26:16,710
definitely a big improvement from like
the first Shadow V stream when you got

7235
03:26:16,710 --> 03:26:16,720
the first Shadow V stream when you got
 

7236
03:26:16,720 --> 03:26:18,550
the first Shadow V stream when you got
to keep in mind that we only had like

7237
03:26:18,550 --> 03:26:18,560
to keep in mind that we only had like
 

7238
03:26:18,560 --> 03:26:21,590
to keep in mind that we only had like
three three Shadow streams up until

7239
03:26:21,590 --> 03:26:21,600
three three Shadow streams up until
 

7240
03:26:21,600 --> 03:26:24,469
three three Shadow streams up until
now and we're still very much beginners

7241
03:26:24,469 --> 03:26:24,479
now and we're still very much beginners
 

7242
03:26:24,479 --> 03:26:30,389
now and we're still very much beginners
so I think Whoever has like like issues

7243
03:26:30,389 --> 03:26:30,399
so I think Whoever has like like issues
 

7244
03:26:30,399 --> 03:26:33,309
so I think Whoever has like like issues
with how we both played the game needs

7245
03:26:33,309 --> 03:26:33,319
with how we both played the game needs
 

7246
03:26:33,319 --> 03:26:36,950
with how we both played the game needs
to shut up

7247
03:26:36,950 --> 03:26:36,960

 

7248
03:26:36,960 --> 03:26:39,830

because also you got to consider that we

7249
03:26:39,830 --> 03:26:39,840
because also you got to consider that we
 

7250
03:26:39,840 --> 03:26:42,590
because also you got to consider that we
don't have that much free time we have

7251
03:26:42,590 --> 03:26:42,600
don't have that much free time we have
 

7252
03:26:42,600 --> 03:26:45,229
don't have that much free time we have
other things to prepare and I'm not

7253
03:26:45,229 --> 03:26:45,239
other things to prepare and I'm not
 

7254
03:26:45,239 --> 03:26:48,229
other things to prepare and I'm not
going to like for a sponsor stream or

7255
03:26:48,229 --> 03:26:48,239
going to like for a sponsor stream or
 

7256
03:26:48,239 --> 03:26:49,870
going to like for a sponsor stream or
any kind of stream I'm not going to

7257
03:26:49,870 --> 03:26:49,880
any kind of stream I'm not going to
 

7258
03:26:49,880 --> 03:26:52,469
any kind of stream I'm not going to
spend 10 hours outside of the streaming

7259
03:26:52,469 --> 03:26:52,479
spend 10 hours outside of the streaming
 

7260
03:26:52,479 --> 03:26:55,870
spend 10 hours outside of the streaming
time to practice for a stream to be

7261
03:26:55,870 --> 03:26:55,880
time to practice for a stream to be
 

7262
03:26:55,880 --> 03:26:58,830
time to practice for a stream to be
absolutely perfect and have no flaws I'm

7263
03:26:58,830 --> 03:26:58,840
absolutely perfect and have no flaws I'm
 

7264
03:26:58,840 --> 03:27:01,229
absolutely perfect and have no flaws I'm
not going to do that

7265
03:27:01,229 --> 03:27:01,239
not going to do that
 

7266
03:27:01,239 --> 03:27:04,790
not going to do that
because why why why I don't have the

7267
03:27:04,790 --> 03:27:04,800
because why why why I don't have the
 

7268
03:27:04,800 --> 03:27:08,469
because why why why I don't have the
time uh but I think I did well and I did

7311
03:28:06,110 --> 03:28:06,120
stream or during the stream or like
 

7312
03:28:06,120 --> 03:28:07,469
stream or during the stream or like
before the tournament or during the

7313
03:28:07,469 --> 03:28:07,479
before the tournament or during the
 

7314
03:28:07,479 --> 03:28:10,349
before the tournament or during the
tournament I honestly don't know how

7315
03:28:10,349 --> 03:28:10,359
tournament I honestly don't know how
 

7316
03:28:10,359 --> 03:28:11,710
tournament I honestly don't know how
it's going to work and what going to

7317
03:28:11,710 --> 03:28:11,720
it's going to work and what going to
 

7318
03:28:11,720 --> 03:28:14,830
it's going to work and what going to
happen but I'm just going to let it

7319
03:28:14,830 --> 03:28:14,840
happen but I'm just going to let it
 

7320
03:28:14,840 --> 03:28:21,150
happen but I'm just going to let it
happen

7321
03:28:21,150 --> 03:28:21,160

 

7322
03:28:21,160 --> 03:28:23,790

yeah I I wonder if for the tournament I

7323
03:28:23,790 --> 03:28:23,800
yeah I I wonder if for the tournament I
 

7324
03:28:23,800 --> 03:28:26,469
yeah I I wonder if for the tournament I
need to prepare maybe more decks or or

7325
03:28:26,469 --> 03:28:26,479
need to prepare maybe more decks or or
 

7326
03:28:26,479 --> 03:28:28,030
need to prepare maybe more decks or or
like if it's normal that in tournaments

7327
03:28:28,030 --> 03:28:28,040
like if it's normal that in tournaments
 

7328
03:28:28,040 --> 03:28:29,630
like if it's normal that in tournaments
you only use one deck I don't know what

7329
03:28:29,630 --> 03:28:29,640
you only use one deck I don't know what
 

7330
03:28:29,640 --> 03:28:32,590
you only use one deck I don't know what
is normal so I will have to ask them if

7331
03:28:32,590 --> 03:28:32,600
is normal so I will have to ask them if
 

7332
03:28:32,600 --> 03:28:34,269
is normal so I will have to ask them if
they want me to prepare more decks well

7333
03:28:34,269 --> 03:28:34,279
they want me to prepare more decks well
 

7334
03:28:34,279 --> 03:28:36,590
they want me to prepare more decks well
then I guess I will do that but I'm not

7335
03:28:36,590 --> 03:28:36,600
then I guess I will do that but I'm not
 

7336
03:28:36,600 --> 03:28:39,429
then I guess I will do that but I'm not
sure like what what to go

7337
03:28:39,429 --> 03:28:39,439
sure like what what to go
 

7338
03:28:39,439 --> 03:28:43,550
sure like what what to go
for but because like in order to really

7339
03:28:43,550 --> 03:28:43,560
for but because like in order to really
 

7340
03:28:43,560 --> 03:28:46,670
for but because like in order to really
really really know exactly what I'm

7341
03:28:46,670 --> 03:28:46,680
really really know exactly what I'm
 

7342
03:28:46,680 --> 03:28:48,990
really really know exactly what I'm
doing and which deck does what and all

7343
03:28:48,990 --> 03:28:49,000
doing and which deck does what and all
 

7344
03:28:49,000 --> 03:28:51,469
doing and which deck does what and all
that I would have to invest hours and

7345
03:28:51,469 --> 03:28:51,479
that I would have to invest hours and
 

7346
03:28:51,479 --> 03:28:54,590
that I would have to invest hours and
hours and hours and weeks into this game

7347
03:28:54,590 --> 03:28:54,600
hours and hours and weeks into this game
 

7348
03:28:54,600 --> 03:28:56,910
hours and hours and weeks into this game
I just don't have the time for that even

7349
03:28:56,910 --> 03:28:56,920
I just don't have the time for that even
 

7350
03:28:56,920 --> 03:28:58,670
I just don't have the time for that even
though it's a wonderful game and I'm

7351
03:28:58,670 --> 03:28:58,680
though it's a wonderful game and I'm
 

7352
03:28:58,680 --> 03:29:00,790
though it's a wonderful game and I'm
really enjoying it but I just don't have

7353
03:29:00,790 --> 03:29:00,800
really enjoying it but I just don't have

the
 

7356
03:29:01,640 --> 03:29:04,590
the
time so I hope it's fine if I just play

03:29:04,590 --> 03:29:04,600
time so I hope it's fine if I just play
 

7358
03:29:04,600 --> 03:29:07,189
time so I hope it's fine if I just play
