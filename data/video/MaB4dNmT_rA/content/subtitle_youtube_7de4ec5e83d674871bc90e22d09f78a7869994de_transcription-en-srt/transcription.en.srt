then
the kids win the game and i have a

120
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:21,040
the kids win the game and i have a
 

121
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,629
the kids win the game and i have a
feeling that

122
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:22,639
feeling that
 

123
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,870
feeling that
today in today's collab we will never

124
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:24,880
today in today's collab we will never
 

125
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,150
today in today's collab we will never
even once manage to open the door but

126
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:28,160
even once manage to open the door but
 

127
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,410
even once manage to open the door but
