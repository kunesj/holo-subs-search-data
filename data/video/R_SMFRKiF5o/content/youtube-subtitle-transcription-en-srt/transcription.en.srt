but uh what do you call like a particle

12280
06:46:45,030 --> 06:46:45,040
but uh what do you call like a particle
 

12281
06:46:45,040 --> 06:46:46,030
but uh what do you call like a particle
or

12282
06:46:46,030 --> 06:46:46,040
or
 

12283
06:46:46,040 --> 06:46:48,910
or
so and the problem was only at that time

12284
06:46:48,910 --> 06:46:48,920
so and the problem was only at that time
 

12285
06:46:48,920 --> 06:46:50,750
so and the problem was only at that time
that's years ago I guess at that time

12286
06:46:50,750 --> 06:46:50,760
that's years ago I guess at that time
 

12287
06:46:50,760 --> 06:46:54,590
that's years ago I guess at that time
the only problem was uh had at home at

12288
06:46:54,590 --> 06:46:54,600
the only problem was uh had at home at
 

12289
06:46:54,600 --> 06:46:57,070
the only problem was uh had at home at
at home only problem was like when you

12290
06:46:57,070 --> 06:46:57,080
at home only problem was like when you
 

12291
06:46:57,080 --> 06:47:01,190
at home only problem was like when you
perceive it that's when it falls apart

12292
06:47:01,190 --> 06:47:01,200
perceive it that's when it falls apart
 

12293
06:47:01,200 --> 06:47:03,110
perceive it that's when it falls apart
interesting but in theory the

12294
06:47:03,110 --> 06:47:03,120
interesting but in theory the
 

12295
06:47:03,120 --> 06:47:04,830
interesting but in theory the
teleportation worked but it when you

12296
06:47:04,830 --> 06:47:04,840
teleportation worked but it when you
 

12297
06:47:04,840 --> 06:47:07,830
teleportation worked but it when you
once you see it when you perceive it I

12298
06:47:07,830 --> 06:47:07,840
once you see it when you perceive it I
 

12299
06:47:07,840 --> 06:47:09,430
once you see it when you perceive it I
don't know

12300
06:47:09,430 --> 06:47:09,440
don't know
 

12301
06:47:09,440 --> 06:47:13,948
don't know
how but then it falls apart but since

12302
06:47:13,948 --> 06:47:13,958
how but then it falls apart but since
 

12303
06:47:13,958 --> 06:47:15,708
how but then it falls apart but since
then

12304
06:47:15,708 --> 06:47:15,718
then
 

12305
06:47:15,718 --> 06:47:18,628
then
probably they've made more

12306
06:47:18,628 --> 06:47:18,638
probably they've made more
 

12307
06:47:18,638 --> 06:47:22,030
probably they've made more
advances but that's so scary I don't

12308
06:47:22,030 --> 06:47:22,040
advances but that's so scary I don't
 

12309
06:47:22,040 --> 06:47:24,350
advances but that's so scary I don't
want such advances to be made just like

12310
06:47:24,350 --> 06:47:24,360
want such advances to be made just like
 

12311
06:47:24,360 --> 06:47:27,750
want such advances to be made just like
with AI man it all goes too far at some

12312
06:47:27,750 --> 06:47:27,760
with AI man it all goes too far at some
 

12313
06:47:27,760 --> 06:47:30,948
with AI man it all goes too far at some
point and only hurts the world who knows

12314
06:47:30,948 --> 06:47:30,958
point and only hurts the world who knows
