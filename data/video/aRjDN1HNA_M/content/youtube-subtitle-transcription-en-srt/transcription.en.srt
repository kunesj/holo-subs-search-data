14548
07:02:57,548 --> 07:02:57,558
that's a good point but I think
 

14549
07:02:57,558 --> 07:03:03,510
that's a good point but I think
I I know a solution but but yeah I I I

14550
07:03:03,510 --> 07:03:03,520
I I know a solution but but yeah I I I
 

14551
07:03:03,520 --> 07:03:04,910
I I know a solution but but yeah I I I
have to consider it because I was

14552
07:03:04,910 --> 07:03:04,920
have to consider it because I was
 

14553
07:03:04,920 --> 07:03:08,708
have to consider it because I was

14558
07:03:14,510 --> 07:03:14,520
and depends if I want to do in a group
 

14559
07:03:14,520 --> 07:03:16,070
and depends if I want to do in a group
or privately

14560
07:03:16,070 --> 07:03:16,080
or privately
 

14561
07:03:16,080 --> 07:03:19,270
or privately
alone uh but even in a group the ones I

14562
07:03:19,270 --> 07:03:19,280
alone uh but even in a group the ones I
 

14563
07:03:19,280 --> 07:03:22,990
alone uh but even in a group the ones I
saw were kind of expensive is so now I'm

14564
07:03:22,990 --> 07:03:23,000
saw were kind of expensive is so now I'm
 

14565
07:03:23,000 --> 07:03:25,788
saw were kind of expensive is so now I'm
wondering maybe this not necessarily

14566
07:03:25,788 --> 07:03:25,798
wondering maybe this not necessarily
 

14567
07:03:25,798 --> 07:03:30,190
wondering maybe this not necessarily
more cheap to do it in my own

14568
07:03:30,190 --> 07:03:30,200

 

14569
07:03:30,200 --> 07:03:34,110

country maybe not

14570
07:03:34,110 --> 07:03:34,120

 

14571
07:03:34,120 --> 07:03:38,510

H maybe I should do it in like a

14572
07:03:38,510 --> 07:03:38,520
H maybe I should do it in like a
 

14573
07:03:38,520 --> 07:03:41,190
H maybe I should do it in like a
vacation within a

14574
07:03:41,190 --> 07:03:41,200
vacation within a
 

14575
07:03:41,200 --> 07:03:43,868
vacation within a

07:03:45,910 --> 07:03:45,920
time that will take up but my sister did
 

14579
07:03:45,920 --> 07:03:48,230
time that will take up but my sister did
it within the vacation so I'm sure it

14580
07:03:48,230 --> 07:03:48,240
it within the vacation so I'm sure it
 

14581
07:03:48,240 --> 07:03:50,868
it within the vacation so I'm sure it
doesn't take up like too much time from

doesn't take that much time
 

14589
07:03:58,520 --> 07:04:00,590
doesn't take that much time
right might be cheaper in a place where

14590
07:04:00,590 --> 07:04:00,600
right might be cheaper in a place where
 

14591
07:04:00,600 --> 07:04:06,270
right might be cheaper in a place where
there's more of an in industry around

14592
07:04:06,270 --> 07:04:06,280

Germans for the div license so that's

14608
07:04:33,070 --> 07:04:33,080
Germans for the div license so that's
 

14609
07:04:33,080 --> 07:04:34,510
Germans for the div license so that's
pretty impressive I wonder if that's

14610
07:04:34,510 --> 07:04:34,520
pretty impressive I wonder if that's
 

14611
07:04:34,520 --> 07:04:36,030
pretty impressive I wonder if that's
pretty

14612
07:04:36,030 --> 07:04:36,040
pretty
 

14613
07:04:36,040 --> 07:04:39,548
pretty
common

14614
07:04:39,548 --> 07:04:39,558

 

14615
07:04:39,558 --> 07:04:44,628

H so

14616
07:04:44,628 --> 07:04:44,638

 

14617
07:04:44,638 --> 07:04:48,468

H I don't know where to do it now I'm

14618
07:04:48,468 --> 07:04:48,478
H I don't know where to do it now I'm
 

14619
07:04:48,478 --> 07:04:53,430
H I don't know where to do it now I'm
kind of torn apart where to do

14620
07:04:53,430 --> 07:04:53,440

 

14621
07:04:53,440 --> 07:04:56,708

it south of Japan generally I feel like

14622
07:04:56,708 --> 07:04:56,718
it south of Japan generally I feel like
 

14623
07:04:56,718 --> 07:04:59,670
it south of Japan generally I feel like
Japan would be expensive but with the

14624
07:04:59,670 --> 07:04:59,680
Japan would be expensive but with the
 

14625
07:04:59,680 --> 07:05:02,150
Japan would be expensive but with the
Yen being so cheap

14626
07:05:02,150 --> 07:05:02,160
Yen being so cheap
 

14627
07:05:02,160 --> 07:05:08,388
Yen being so cheap
then I guess it's not maybe that

14628
07:05:08,388 --> 07:05:08,398

 

14629
07:05:08,398 --> 07:05:11,590

07:18:14,920 --> 07:18:18,468
others and my mom then proceeded to make
her food but um I know exactly how to

15124
07:18:18,468 --> 07:18:18,478
her food but um I know exactly how to
 

15125
07:18:18,478 --> 07:18:21,030

15129
07:18:24,878 --> 07:18:28,468
doesn't have like waste really I figured
out the exact portion size cuz they sell

15130
07:18:28,468 --> 07:18:28,478
out the exact portion size cuz they sell
 

15131

out the exact portion size cuz they sell
uh wet food usually most of them are

07:18:39,590 --> 07:18:39,600
half but then she would still have
 

15139
07:18:39,600 --> 07:18:41,468
half but then she would still have
things left over so I portion those

15140
07:18:41,468 --> 07:18:41,478
things left over so I portion those
 

15141
