mm especially anime mm
 

83
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:30,629

00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:34,000
M and then after the closed Alpha they
 

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,590
M and then after the closed Alpha they
went so quiet it took them

88
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:37,600
went so quiet it took them
 

89
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,189
went so quiet it took them
ages to finally bring this game out

90
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:41,199
ages to finally bring this game out
 

91
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,469

which seems to be one of the issues that

92
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:44,479
which seems to be one of the issues that
 

93
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,790
which seems to be one of the issues that
lead to the state of things now because

94
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:47,800
lead to the state of things now because
 

95
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,390
lead to the state of things now because
it just took them too

96
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:49,400
it just took them too
 

97
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,790
it just took them too
long um yeah and then I guess they got

98
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:52,800
long um yeah and then I guess they got
 

99
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,909

947
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,470
will be turquoise like that so [\h__\h] I
don't know if I really want

948
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:26,480
don't know if I really want
 

949
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,230
don't know if I really want
that instead I I don't know but that

950
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:29,240
that instead I I don't know but that
 

951
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,110
that instead I I don't know but that
won't look like me if I do a different

952
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:31,120
won't look like me if I do a different
 

953
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,950
won't look like me if I do a different
hair

954
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:32,960
hair
 

955
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,710
hair
coloration and then like I noticed for

956
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:35,720
coloration and then like I noticed for
 

957
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,470
coloration and then like I noticed for
the twin or yeah like here example in

958
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:39,480
the twin or yeah like here example in
 

959
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,430
the twin or yeah like here example in
theory this would start lower if you

960
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:41,440
theory this would start lower if you
 

961
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,909
theory this would start lower if you
imagine the hair to be let down that

962
00:26:43,909 --> 00:26:43,919
imagine the hair to be let down that
 

963
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,110
imagine the hair to be let down that
would be way

964
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:46,120
would be way
 

965
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,149
would be way
lower than if we look at this that

966
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:49,159
lower than if we look at this that
 

967
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:51,510
lower than if we look at this that
starts already above the

968
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:51,520
starts already above the
 

969
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,269
starts already above the
ears so I wish it was like

970
00:26:54,269 --> 00:26:54,279
ears so I wish it was like
 

971
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,789
ears so I wish it was like

necessarily you know we 100% have to
keep it a secret but let's just keep it

6724
03:14:46,150 --> 03:14:46,160
keep it a secret but let's just keep it
 

6725
03:14:46,160 --> 03:14:49,429
keep it a secret but let's just keep it
under the the you know

6726
03:14:49,429 --> 03:14:49,439
under the the you know
 

6727
03:14:49,439 --> 03:14:51,590
under the the you know
locks

locks
 

6729
03:14:51,600 --> 03:14:55,269
locks
uh but it's more than any it's more than

6730
03:14:55,269 --> 03:14:55,279
uh but it's more than any it's more than
 

6731
03:14:55,279 --> 03:14:57,349

completely scrambled and messed up
 

9757
04:30:51,439 --> 04:30:54,429
