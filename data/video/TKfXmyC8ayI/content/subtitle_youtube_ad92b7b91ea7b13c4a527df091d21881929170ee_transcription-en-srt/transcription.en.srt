then i really wonder like how did it not
 

3891

end up in the snack box
 

3893
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:22,709
end up in the snack box
but besides that it was pretty good

3894
01:27:22,709 --> 01:27:22,719
but besides that it was pretty good
 

3895
01:27:22,719 --> 01:27:24,709
but besides that it was pretty good
there was like one snack

3896
01:27:24,709 --> 01:27:24,719
there was like one snack
 

3897
01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:25,910
there was like one snack
of

3898
01:27:25,910 --> 01:27:25,920
of
 

3899
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:27,669
of
these ones these ones were really

3900
01:27:27,669 --> 01:27:27,679
these ones these ones were really
 

3901
01:27:27,679 --> 01:27:30,709
these ones these ones were really
questionable so i disqualified them

3902
01:27:30,709 --> 01:27:30,719
questionable so i disqualified them
 

3903
01:27:30,719 --> 01:27:33,590
questionable so i disqualified them
because it's not it's a uk snack it

3904
01:27:33,590 --> 01:27:33,600
because it's not it's a uk snack it
 

3905
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:35,590
because it's not it's a uk snack it
doesn't even have any

3906
01:27:35,590 --> 01:27:35,600
doesn't even have any
 

3907
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:38,229
doesn't even have any
any swedish on it

3908
01:27:38,229 --> 01:27:38,239
any swedish on it
 

3909
01:27:38,239 --> 01:27:39,430
any swedish on it
so

3910
01:27:39,430 --> 01:27:39,440
so
 

3911
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:41,830
so
that's questionable that could have been

3912
01:27:41,830 --> 01:27:41,840
that's questionable that could have been
 

3913
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:45,510
that's questionable that could have been
replaced with licorice or with marble

3914
01:27:45,510 --> 01:27:45,520
replaced with licorice or with marble
 

3915
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:47,669
replaced with licorice or with marble
but i feel like they didn't put licorice

3916
01:27:47,669 --> 01:27:47,679
but i feel like they didn't put licorice
 

3917
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:50,149
but i feel like they didn't put licorice
in it because they try to

3918
01:27:50,149 --> 01:27:50,159
in it because they try to
 

3919
01:27:50,159 --> 01:27:53,110
in it because they try to
stray away from things that uh the

3920
01:27:53,110 --> 01:27:53,120
stray away from things that uh the
 

3921
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:55,669
stray away from things that uh the
customers probably wouldn't like

3922
01:27:55,669 --> 01:27:55,679
customers probably wouldn't like
 

3923
01:27:55,679 --> 01:27:57,910
customers probably wouldn't like
that's my impression

3924
01:27:57,910 --> 01:27:57,920
that's my impression
 

3925
01:27:57,920 --> 01:27:59,590
that's my impression
because in the

3926
01:27:59,590 --> 01:27:59,600
because in the
 

3927
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:01,350
because in the
in the other boxes for example they also

3928
01:28:01,350 --> 01:28:01,360
in the other boxes for example they also
 

3929
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:03,830
in the other boxes for example they also
didn't have anything like super spicy or

3930
01:28:03,830 --> 01:28:03,840
didn't have anything like super spicy or
 

3931
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:06,629
didn't have anything like super spicy or
whatever just something that

3932
01:28:06,629 --> 01:28:06,639
whatever just something that
 

3933
01:28:06,639 --> 01:28:09,189
whatever just something that
most people probably can eat
