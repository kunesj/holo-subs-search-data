memory well it's good
 

5547
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:16,389
memory well it's good
right faster if we get bigger

5548
02:34:16,389 --> 02:34:16,399

 

5549
02:34:16,399 --> 02:34:19,469

02:34:23,990 --> 02:34:24,000
how how much longer for your memory to
 

5555
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:27,870
how how much longer for your memory to
download um so I'm currently at uh so I

5556
02:34:27,870 --> 02:34:27,880
download um so I'm currently at uh so I
 

5557
02:34:27,880 --> 02:34:30,389
download um so I'm currently at uh so I
have a stick and then I put

5558
02:34:30,389 --> 02:34:30,399
have a stick and then I put
 

5559
02:34:30,399 --> 02:34:33,670
have a stick and then I put
it and it's at 80% and then I have to

5560
02:34:33,670 --> 02:34:33,680
it and it's at 80% and then I have to
 

5561
02:34:33,680 --> 02:34:35,670
it and it's at 80% and then I have to
put it on the other data machine and

5562
02:34:35,670 --> 02:34:35,680
put it on the other data machine and
 

5563
02:34:35,680 --> 02:34:39,150
put it on the other data machine and
then this is really automaton technology

5564
02:34:39,150 --> 02:34:39,160
then this is really automaton technology
 

5565
02:34:39,160 --> 02:34:41,269
then this is really automaton technology
right here yeah this thing is like when

5566
02:34:41,269 --> 02:34:41,279
right here yeah this thing is like when
 

5567
02:34:41,279 --> 02:34:43,429
right here yeah this thing is like when
I was created they wanted like it to be

5568
02:34:43,429 --> 02:34:43,439
I was created they wanted like it to be
 

5569
02:34:43,439 --> 02:34:46,269
I was created they wanted like it to be
really secure you know so they they

5570
02:34:46,269 --> 02:34:46,279
really secure you know so they they
 

5571
02:34:46,279 --> 02:34:50,150
really secure you know so they they
didn't let any like my brain is split in

5572
02:34:50,150 --> 02:34:50,160
didn't let any like my brain is split in
 

5573
02:34:50,160 --> 02:34:52,910
didn't let any like my brain is split in
they yeah it's very complicated imimi

5574

they yeah it's very complicated imimi
 

5575
02:34:52,920 --> 02:34:54,710
they yeah it's very complicated imimi
engineering very

5576
02:34:54,710 --> 02:34:54,720
engineering very
 

5577
02:34:54,720 --> 02:34:58,150
engineering very
complicated lots of gear and cogs

5578
02:34:58,150 --> 02:34:58,160
complicated lots of gear and cogs
 

5579
02:34:58,160 --> 02:35:02,230
complicated lots of gear and cogs
spinning around yeah but it's

5580
02:35:02,230 --> 02:35:02,240
spinning around yeah but it's
 

5581
02:35:02,240 --> 02:35:03,380
spinning around yeah but it's
uh

5582
02:35:03,380 --> 02:35:03,390
