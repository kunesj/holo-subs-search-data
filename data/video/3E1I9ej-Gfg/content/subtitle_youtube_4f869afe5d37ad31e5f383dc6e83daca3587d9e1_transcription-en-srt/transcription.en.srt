but
 

13659
05:45:41,040 --> 05:45:43,990
but
because it's expensive yeah probably but

13660
05:45:43,990 --> 05:45:44,000
because it's expensive yeah probably but
 

13661
05:45:44,000 --> 05:45:46,628
because it's expensive yeah probably but
i honestly i haven't really looked into

13662
05:45:46,628 --> 05:45:46,638
i honestly i haven't really looked into
 

13663
05:45:46,638 --> 05:45:48,230
i honestly i haven't really looked into
that

13664
05:45:48,230 --> 05:45:48,240
that
 

13665
05:45:48,240 --> 05:45:50,948
that
yet so i don't really know if it's even

13666
05:45:50,948 --> 05:45:50,958
yet so i don't really know if it's even
 

13667
05:45:50,958 --> 05:45:54,230
yet so i don't really know if it's even
in in the realm of possibility

13668
05:45:54,230 --> 05:45:54,240
in in the realm of possibility
 

13669
05:45:54,240 --> 05:45:56,150
in in the realm of possibility
um

13670
05:45:56,150 --> 05:45:56,160
