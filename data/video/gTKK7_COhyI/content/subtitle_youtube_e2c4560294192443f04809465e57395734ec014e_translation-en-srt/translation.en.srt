3270
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:25,649

wondering who Thin-chan and Suicchan are. I

3271
01:29:25,649 --> 01:29:28,649
wondering who Thin-chan and Suicchan are. I

3273
01:29:28,659 --> 01:29:31,260

think it would have been better if it wasn't Botan-chan.

3274
01:29:31,260 --> 01:29:31,270
think it would have been better if it wasn't Botan-chan.
 

3275
01:29:31,270 --> 01:29:35,040
think it would have been better if it wasn't Botan-chan.
Botan-chan is too sharp, so maybe

3276
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:35,050
Botan-chan is too sharp, so maybe
 

3277
01:29:35,050 --> 01:29:36,810
Botan-chan is too sharp, so maybe
Switch-chan.

3278
01:29:36,810 --> 01:29:36,820
Switch-chan.
 

3279
01:29:36,820 --> 01:29:40,050
Switch-chan.
If it wasn't 2-chan, I think I could have

3280
01:29:40,050 --> 01:29:40,060
If it wasn't 2-chan, I think I could have
 

3281
01:29:40,060 --> 01:29:44,500
If it wasn't 2-chan, I think I could have
made it feel like one-chan was fine.  I

3282
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:44,510
made it feel like one-chan was fine.  I
 

3283
01:29:44,510 --> 01:29:45,790
made it feel like one-chan was fine.  I
thought, ``That's

3284
01:29:45,790 --> 01:29:45,800
thought, ``That's
