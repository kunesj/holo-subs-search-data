1355
00:41:54,839 --> 00:41:58,310
it's just the first perspective I think
it's not really to some live streams or

1356
00:41:58,310 --> 00:41:58,320
it's not really to some live streams or
 

1357
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,950
it's not really to some live streams or
yeah some skills or

1358
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:00,960
yeah some skills or
 

1359
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,790
yeah some skills or
just from the look of us

1360
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:04,800

 

1361
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,550

I would go for uh if we're going off of

1362
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:07,560
I would go for uh if we're going off of
 

1363
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:12,130
I would go for uh if we're going off of
how we've oh yeah yeah

hard to choose one person but so your
answer is good okay

1370
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:22,500
answer is good okay
 

1371
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:27,349
answer is good okay
okay okay so let's look at the results

1372
00:42:27,349 --> 00:42:27,359
okay okay so let's look at the results
 

1373
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:31,089
okay okay so let's look at the results
here are the results of this surveys
