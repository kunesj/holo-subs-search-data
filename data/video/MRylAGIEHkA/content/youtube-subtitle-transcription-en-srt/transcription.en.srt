in this
minimally only a little bit um but uh

348
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,000
minimally only a little bit um but uh
 

349
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,829
minimally only a little bit um but uh
I our our perm system has changed

350
00:13:23,829 --> 00:13:23,839
I our our perm system has changed
 

351
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,470
I our our perm system has changed
several times over the past years but uh

352
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:26,480
several times over the past years but uh
 

353
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,990
several times over the past years but uh
there was a time where it was like uh an

354
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:30,000
there was a time where it was like uh an
 

355
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,550
there was a time where it was like uh an
an Excel

356
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:31,560
an Excel
 

357
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,189
an Excel
sheet and in the Excel sheet it would

358
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:34,199
sheet and in the Excel sheet it would
 

359
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:37,750
sheet and in the Excel sheet it would
say which games are okay for members and

360
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:37,760
say which games are okay for members and
 

361
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,269
say which games are okay for members and
back then we obviously had of course way

362
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:40,279
back then we obviously had of course way
 

363
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:42,949
back then we obviously had of course way
less games than now and so it was a

364
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:42,959
less games than now and so it was a
 

365
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:47,389
less games than now and so it was a
little bit more over seeable over a

366
00:13:47,389 --> 00:13:47,399
little bit more over seeable over a
 

367
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:49,910
little bit more over seeable over a
Excel sheet and so I would look there's

368
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:49,920
Excel sheet and so I would look there's
 

369
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,230
Excel sheet and so I would look there's
this one column for members okay and

370
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:53,240
this one column for members okay and
 

371
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,749
this one column for members okay and
just like barely any games were members

372
00:13:55,749 --> 00:13:55,759
just like barely any games were members
 

373
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:58,509
just like barely any games were members
okay and I was like hey can we get more

374
00:13:58,509 --> 00:13:58,519
okay and I was like hey can we get more
 

375
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:01,069
okay and I was like hey can we get more
members members like games and they were

376
00:14:01,069 --> 00:14:01,079
members members like games and they were
 

377
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:03,590
members members like games and they were
like well you have to tell us then when

378
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:03,600
like well you have to tell us then when
 

379
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,150
like well you have to tell us then when
you apply for the game perms that you

380
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:07,160
you apply for the game perms that you
 

381
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,470
you apply for the game perms that you
want it for members only and ever since

382
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:09,480
want it for members only and ever since
 

383
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,790
want it for members only and ever since
even if I'm not playing planning to play

384
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:11,800
even if I'm not playing planning to play
 

385
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,230
even if I'm not playing planning to play
it on members only I've been applying

386
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:14,240
it on members only I've been applying
 

387
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,949
it on members only I've been applying
for members uh perms for every single

388
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:16,959
for members uh perms for every single
 

389
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,150
for members uh perms for every single
game that I've been generally applying

390
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:19,160
game that I've been generally applying
 

391
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,350
game that I've been generally applying
for and then and then I swear so many of

392
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:22,360
for and then and then I swear so many of
 

393
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,230
for and then and then I swear so many of
the games I applied for we got members

394
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:24,240
the games I applied for we got members
 

395
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,749
the games I applied for we got members
per for and then the list kept on

396
00:14:25,749 --> 00:14:25,759
per for and then the list kept on
 

397
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:27,030
per for and then the list kept on
growing and growing and growing and

398
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:27,040
growing and growing and growing and
 

399
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,189
growing and growing and growing and
growing and then and then the whole

400
00:14:29,189 --> 00:14:29,199
growing and then and then the whole
 

401
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,910
growing and then and then the whole
system changed and now we don't have to

402
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:30,920
system changed and now we don't have to
 

403
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,110
system changed and now we don't have to
write that anymore now it's just like

404
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:33,120
write that anymore now it's just like
 

405
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,870
write that anymore now it's just like
automatically assumed it seems and they

406
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:35,880
automatically assumed it seems and they
 

407
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,030
automatically assumed it seems and they
ask for it automatically so now now we

408
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,040
ask for it automatically so now now we
 

409
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,430
ask for it automatically so now now we
really have a

410
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:40,440
really have a
 

411
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,350

lot
yeah yeah I just thought well even if I

yeah yeah I just thought well even if I
 

415
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:47,030
yeah yeah I just thought well even if I
don't want to necessarily play on

416
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,040
don't want to necessarily play on
 

417
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,749

soon where
you can

466
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:54,210
you can
 

467
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:56,990
you can
[Laughter]

468
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:57,000

join hey so cool I wonder what she used

470
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:00,120
join hey so cool I wonder what she used
 

471
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,309
join hey so cool I wonder what she used
to play like what class and so on is she

472
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:03,319
to play like what class and so on is she
 

473
00:16:03,319 --> 00:16:04,990
to play like what class and so on is she
on the same server I would think so

474
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:05,000
on the same server I would think so
 

475
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,949
on the same server I would think so
there's only free servers and then

476
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:06,959
there's only free servers and then
 

477
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,110
there's only free servers and then
there's like channels within the server

478
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:09,120
there's like channels within the server
 

479
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,910
there's like channels within the server
but the channels you can always switch

480
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:11,920
but the channels you can always switch
 

481
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,590
but the channels you can always switch
and the server it wouldn't make any

482
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:13,600
and the server it wouldn't make any
 

483
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,350
and the server it wouldn't make any
sense for her not to go for the English

484
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:15,360
sense for her not to go for the English
 

485
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,710
sense for her not to go for the English
server I

486
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:16,720
server I
 

487
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,550
server I
think

488
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:20,560

 

489
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,230

00:32:39,389 --> 00:32:39,399
like newly built but it bores me the
 

1181
00:32:39,399 --> 00:32:41,430
like newly built but it bores me the
design bores me and I eventually want to

1183
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,430

1185
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,509

a little bit of a tile because we saw we

1186
00:32:45,509 --> 00:32:45,519
a little bit of a tile because we saw we
 

1187
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,549
a little bit of a tile because we saw we
saw a

1188
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:47,559
saw a
 

1189
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:50,029
saw a
loophole we saw a

1190
00:32:50,029 --> 00:32:50,039
loophole we saw a
 

1191
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:55,269
loophole we saw a
loophole

1192
00:32:55,269 --> 00:32:55,279

 

1193
00:32:55,279 --> 00:33:01,110

um so

1194
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:01,120

 

1195
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,990

when is she going to play the

1196
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:03,000
when is she going to play the
 

1197
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,110
when is she going to play the
game

1198
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:07,120

 

1199
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,549

never

1200
00:33:09,549 --> 00:33:09,559
never
 

1201
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:13,070
never
so where's my

1202
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:13,080

 

1203
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:28,230

mouse here

1204
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:28,240

 

1205
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,509

so these are

1206
00:33:29,509 --> 00:33:29,519
so these are
 

1207
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,230
so these are
tiles so the

1208
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:32,240
tiles so the
 

1209
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,350
tiles so the
loophole was

1210
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:34,360
loophole was
 

1211
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:37,629
loophole was
to just try hope that it's a good

1212
00:33:37,629 --> 00:33:37,639
to just try hope that it's a good
 

1213
00:33:37,639 --> 00:33:42,190
to just try hope that it's a good
placement if we um make the

1214
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:42,200
placement if we um make the
 

1215
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,029
placement if we um make the
holes in between the

1216
00:33:45,029 --> 00:33:45,039
holes in between the
 

1217
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:48,950
holes in between the
tiles but those lines were really small

1218
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:48,960
tiles but those lines were really small
 

1219
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,669
tiles but those lines were really small
so we had to like use a really small

1220
00:33:52,669 --> 00:33:52,679
so we had to like use a really small
 

1221
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:56,629
so we had to like use a really small
drill and uh a little a tiny bit like

1222
00:33:56,629 --> 00:33:56,639
drill and uh a little a tiny bit like
 

1223
00:33:56,639 --> 00:33:58,750
drill and uh a little a tiny bit like
one millimeter

1224
00:33:58,750 --> 00:33:58,760
one millimeter
 

1225
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:03,509
one millimeter
like kind of broke and like got off my

1226
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:03,519
like kind of broke and like got off my
 

1227
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:06,070
like kind of broke and like got off my
my my mom put tape over it duct tape so

1228
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:06,080
my my mom put tape over it duct tape so
 

1229
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,350
my my mom put tape over it duct tape so
that it wouldn't be too bad and then

1230
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:07,360
that it wouldn't be too bad and then
 

1231
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,069
that it wouldn't be too bad and then
when we ripped it off it was like it was

1232
00:34:09,069 --> 00:34:09,079
when we ripped it off it was like it was
 

1233
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:12,270
when we ripped it off it was like it was
like like a tiny piece of the tile uh

1234
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:12,280
like like a tiny piece of the tile uh
 

1235
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,470
like like a tiny piece of the tile uh
chipped off but like really only just a

1236
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:14,480
chipped off but like really only just a
 

1237
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,310
chipped off but like really only just a
Time minutes like you can't even notice

1238
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:16,320
Time minutes like you can't even notice
 

1239
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,550
Time minutes like you can't even notice
and on top of that is the mirror now

anyway but our or I guess our original
 

1243
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,470
anyway but our or I guess our original
fear was that it would like break like

1244
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:22,480
fear was that it would like break like
 

1245
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,629
fear was that it would like break like
this I guess I don't know if that's

1246
00:34:23,629 --> 00:34:23,639
this I guess I don't know if that's
 

1247
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:25,750
this I guess I don't know if that's
really how it would break but

1248
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:25,760
really how it would break but
 

1249
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,750
