2956
01:10:52,870 --> 01:10:52,880
you know it's good practice for you too
 

2957
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:54,390
you know it's good practice for you too
especially for aiming and things like

2958
01:10:54,390 --> 01:10:54,400
especially for aiming and things like
 

2959
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,310
especially for aiming and things like
that true yeah

2960
01:10:56,310 --> 01:10:56,320
that true yeah
 

2961
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:59,510
that true yeah
i i

2962
01:10:59,510 --> 01:10:59,520

 

2963
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:01,750

but with this one where i have to go

2964
01:11:01,750 --> 01:11:01,760
but with this one where i have to go
 

2965
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:05,189
but with this one where i have to go
slower i can take some time to aim

2966
01:11:05,189 --> 01:11:05,199
slower i can take some time to aim
 

2967
01:11:05,199 --> 01:11:07,189
slower i can take some time to aim
properly

2968
01:11:07,189 --> 01:11:07,199
properly
 

2969
01:11:07,199 --> 01:11:09,350
properly
yeah it's better in the long run because

2970
01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:09,360
yeah it's better in the long run because
 

2971
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:23,189
yeah it's better in the long run because
then when you do switch to like

2972
01:11:23,189 --> 01:11:23,199

 

2973
01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:24,149

5812
02:22:07,990 --> 02:22:08,000
the top on the score yes yes so when you
 

5813
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:09,830
the top on the score yes yes so when you
capture it and then you get it you get

5814
02:22:09,830 --> 02:22:09,840
capture it and then you get it you get
 

5815
02:22:09,840 --> 02:22:11,110
capture it and then you get it you get
two points and then yeah when you defend

5816
02:22:11,110 --> 02:22:11,120
two points and then yeah when you defend
 

5817
02:22:11,120 --> 02:22:12,550

it's a little complicated um but you

5820
02:22:14,469 --> 02:22:14,479
it's a little complicated um but you
 

5821
02:22:14,479 --> 02:22:15,990
it's a little complicated um but you
can't actually win the whole game like

5822
02:22:15,990 --> 02:22:16,000
can't actually win the whole game like
 

5823
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:17,750
can't actually win the whole game like
say you have three out of four points

5824
02:22:17,750 --> 02:22:17,760
say you have three out of four points
 

5825
02:22:17,760 --> 02:22:20,070
say you have three out of four points
and you you win in defense even though

5826
02:22:20,070 --> 02:22:20,080
and you you win in defense even though
 

5827
02:22:20,080 --> 02:22:21,750
and you you win in defense even though
you get a point usually you can't win

5828
02:22:21,750 --> 02:22:21,760
you get a point usually you can't win
 

5829
02:22:21,760 --> 02:22:23,110
you get a point usually you can't win
the game like that you have to capture

the game like that you have to capture
 

5831
02:22:23,120 --> 02:22:27,670
