There's something going on in that direction, so
 

1120
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:05,450
There's something going on in that direction, so
Ame-chan knows that, and

1121
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:05,460
Ame-chan knows that, and
 

1122
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:08,390
Ame-chan knows that, and
since she's on that plane right now, she's

1123

since she's on that plane right now, she's

since she's on that plane right now, she's
telling her to be careful because there's something there, but she can't

1126
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,270

tell Gura-chan.  I'm always

1128

asking what's going on at 9 o'clock.
