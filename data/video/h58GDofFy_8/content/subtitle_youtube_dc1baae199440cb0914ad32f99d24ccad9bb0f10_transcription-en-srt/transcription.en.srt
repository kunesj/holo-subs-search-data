1479
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,510
people yeah
right it is easy to stop them there's

1480
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:38,520
right it is easy to stop them there's
 

1481
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,950

1499
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:03,829

if maybe if we were to stop the little

1500
00:40:03,829 --> 00:40:03,839
if maybe if we were to stop the little
 

1501
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,530

before they come in okay let's search
 

1511
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:18,290
before they come in okay let's search
over the control panel for the ferris

1512

are there eyeballs on the ferris wheel

1524
00:40:36,589 --> 00:40:36,599
are there eyeballs on the ferris wheel
 

1525
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:39,109

he's away we can flip it so when he
 

2901
01:11:09,780 --> 01:11:12,169
he's away we can flip it so when he
unfixes it then it'll reverse that's

2902
01:11:12,169 --> 01:11:12,179
unfixes it then it'll reverse that's
 

2903
01:11:12,179 --> 01:11:15,290
unfixes it then it'll reverse that's
right you flip the switch and then

oh rather they kind of just turn to dust

3000
01:13:17,709 --> 01:13:17,719

 

3001
01:13:17,719 --> 01:13:20,270

is there a power plug nearby

3002
01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:20,280
is there a power plug nearby
 

3003
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:21,530
is there a power plug nearby
what was that

3004
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:21,540
what was that
 

3005
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:25,850
what was that
or the power plug no yeah for the vacuum

3006
01:13:25,850 --> 01:13:25,860
or the power plug no yeah for the vacuum
 

3007
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:27,950
or the power plug no yeah for the vacuum
interestingly enough the electricity

3008
01:13:27,950 --> 01:13:27,960
interestingly enough the electricity
 

3009
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:29,870
interestingly enough the electricity
here wasn't actually really electricity

3010
01:13:29,870 --> 01:13:29,880
here wasn't actually really electricity
 

3011
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:32,090
here wasn't actually really electricity
you see you plugged it into the wall but

3012
01:13:32,090 --> 01:13:32,100
you see you plugged it into the wall but
 

3013
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:33,649
you see you plugged it into the wall but
this place doesn't actually have real

3014

this place doesn't actually have real
 

3015
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:35,689
this place doesn't actually have real
electricity you guys have kind of

3016
01:13:35,689 --> 01:13:35,699
electricity you guys have kind of
 

3017
01:13:35,699 --> 01:13:37,610
electricity you guys have kind of
realized it's running off of the

3018
01:13:37,610 --> 01:13:37,620

01:36:35,870 --> 01:36:35,880
um first on the mirror right in front of
 

3707
01:36:35,880 --> 01:36:37,550
um first on the mirror right in front of
you

3708
01:36:37,550 --> 01:36:37,560
you
 

3709
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:39,950
you
and you try to shine it

3710
01:36:39,950 --> 01:36:39,960
and you try to shine it
 

3711
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:43,129
and you try to shine it
um in such a way that it reflects

3712
01:36:43,129 --> 01:36:43,139
um in such a way that it reflects
 

3713
01:36:43,139 --> 01:36:44,450
um in such a way that it reflects
to

3714
01:36:44,450 --> 01:36:44,460
to
 

3715
01:36:44,460 --> 01:36:46,370
to
what appears to be the one that's moving

3716
01:36:46,370 --> 01:36:46,380
what appears to be the one that's moving
 

3717
01:36:46,380 --> 01:36:47,810
what appears to be the one that's moving
a bit strangely

3718
01:36:47,810 --> 01:36:47,820
a bit strangely
 

3719
01:36:47,820 --> 01:36:49,310
a bit strangely
and you watch as the light does

3720
01:36:49,310 --> 01:36:49,320
and you watch as the light does
 

3721
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:51,290
and you watch as the light does
something really odd the way that it

3722
01:36:51,290 --> 01:36:51,300
something really odd the way that it
 

3723
01:36:51,300 --> 01:36:53,149
something really odd the way that it
moves through space here is so strange

3724
01:36:53,149 --> 01:36:53,159
moves through space here is so strange
 

3725
01:36:53,159 --> 01:36:55,010
moves through space here is so strange
it seems

3726
01:36:55,010 --> 01:36:55,020
it seems
 

3727
01:36:55,020 --> 01:36:56,689
it seems
different than anything you've seen

3728
01:36:56,689 --> 01:36:56,699
different than anything you've seen
 

3729
01:36:56,699 --> 01:36:58,430
different than anything you've seen
before it's almost like the light is

3730
01:36:58,430 --> 01:36:58,440
before it's almost like the light is
 

3731
01:36:58,440 --> 01:36:59,930
before it's almost like the light is
bouncing off

3732
01:36:59,930 --> 01:36:59,940
bouncing off
 

3733
01:36:59,940 --> 01:37:03,229
bouncing off
of each mirror in an alternate sort of

3734
01:37:03,229 --> 01:37:03,239
of each mirror in an alternate sort of
 

3735
01:37:03,239 --> 01:37:05,090
of each mirror in an alternate sort of
form of space

3736
01:37:05,090 --> 01:37:05,100
form of space
 

3737
01:37:05,100 --> 01:37:06,709
form of space
almost as though as passing through

3738
01:37:06,709 --> 01:37:06,719
almost as though as passing through
 

3739
01:37:06,719 --> 01:37:08,890
almost as though as passing through
dimensions

3740
01:37:08,890 --> 01:37:08,900
dimensions
 

3741
01:37:08,900 --> 01:37:12,530
dimensions
and eventually with enough finesse

3742
01:37:12,530 --> 01:37:12,540
and eventually with enough finesse
 

3743
01:37:12,540 --> 01:37:15,169

version of you that seems to be moving a
 

3747
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:18,410
version of you that seems to be moving a
bit differently than all of the ones

3748

bit differently than all of the ones
 

3749
01:37:18,420 --> 01:37:21,250

01:49:24,370 --> 01:49:24,380
well
 

4317
01:49:24,380 --> 01:49:27,050
well
inside the mirror which are now you guys

4318
01:49:27,050 --> 01:49:27,060
inside the mirror which are now you guys
 

4319
01:49:27,060 --> 01:49:29,930
inside the mirror which are now you guys
that you control you tickle the doll of

4320
01:49:29,930 --> 01:49:29,940
that you control you tickle the doll of
 

4321
01:49:29,940 --> 01:49:31,669
that you control you tickle the doll of
your other self who then immediately

4322
01:49:31,669 --> 01:49:31,679
your other self who then immediately
 

4323
01:49:31,679 --> 01:49:35,629
your other self who then immediately
reacts to the tickling

4324
01:49:35,629 --> 01:49:35,639

 

4325
01:49:35,639 --> 01:49:37,669

so the one on the outside right exactly

4326
01:49:37,669 --> 01:49:37,679
so the one on the outside right exactly
 

4327
01:49:37,679 --> 01:49:40,070
