839
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:57,509

aligned not randomly but like it's just

840
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:57,519
aligned not randomly but like it's just
 

841
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:00,830
aligned not randomly but like it's just
a a collection of short stories so yeah

a a collection of short stories so yeah
 

843
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,630

okay but they could have aligned the

okay but they could have aligned the
 

845
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,549

timelines at least in the first season
 

847
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,230

like for the for the live action but

like for the for the live action but
 

849
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,549
like for the for the live action but
okay then that means I guess why they

850
00:28:11,549 --> 00:28:11,559
okay then that means I guess why they
 

851
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:13,950
okay then that means I guess why they
maybe didn't do that is

852
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:13,960
maybe didn't do that is
 

853
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:17,669
maybe didn't do that is
because maybe maybe the reason

854
00:28:17,669 --> 00:28:17,679
because maybe maybe the reason
 

855
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,909
because maybe maybe the reason
is um I'm thinking that it might be

856
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:21,919
is um I'm thinking that it might be
 

857
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:23,870
is um I'm thinking that it might be
because then we wouldn't have seen Silla

859
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,350

861
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,029

really wanted us to see her

it but I'm like not sure how long how
long does it take to read a clock some

1580
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:30,000
long does it take to read a clock some
 

1581
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,630
long does it take to read a clock some
people surely I've seen people read it

2029
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:15,910

like um for example Japanese people cuz

2030
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:15,920
like um for example Japanese people cuz
 

2031
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,670
like um for example Japanese people cuz
first of all they that's not their

2032
00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:17,680
first of all they that's not their
 

2033
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:20,670
first of all they that's not their
writing system they learn romanized

2034
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:20,680
writing system they learn romanized
 

2035
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:24,029
writing system they learn romanized
letters but I guess that's the extent of

2036
00:57:24,029 --> 00:57:24,039
letters but I guess that's the extent of
 

2037
00:57:24,039 --> 00:57:26,430

where it ends they probably don't learn

2038
00:57:26,430 --> 00:57:26,440
where it ends they probably don't learn
 

2039
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:29,309
where it ends they probably don't learn
cursive or they just touch upon it

2040
00:57:29,309 --> 00:57:29,319
cursive or they just touch upon it
 

2041

going on in the in the battle they were
having like a completely different

3956
01:45:31,430 --> 01:45:31,440
having like a completely different
 

3957
01:45:31,440 --> 01:45:34,589
having like a completely different
scenario on the side a second POV would

3958
01:45:34,589 --> 01:45:34,599
scenario on the side a second POV would
 

3959
01:45:34,599 --> 01:45:36,510
scenario on the side a second POV would
have been good for that perhaps but no

3960
01:45:36,510 --> 01:45:36,520
have been good for that perhaps but no
 

3961
01:45:36,520 --> 01:45:38,030
have been good for that perhaps but no
one would have paid attention to the

3962
01:45:38,030 --> 01:45:38,040
one would have paid attention to the
 

3963
01:45:38,040 --> 01:45:41,109
one would have paid attention to the
actual egg hunt then in that

3964
01:45:41,109 --> 01:45:41,119
actual egg hunt then in that
 

3965
01:45:41,119 --> 01:45:43,070
actual egg hunt then in that
situation

3966
01:45:43,070 --> 01:45:43,080

opposed to Discord last time I was
thinking of doing Discord this time too

3982
01:46:02,629 --> 01:46:02,639
thinking of doing Discord this time too
 

3983
01:46:02,639 --> 01:46:06,070
thinking of doing Discord this time too
but there was an original plan to

3984
01:46:06,070 --> 01:46:06,080
but there was an original plan to
 

3985
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:09,910
but there was an original plan to
implement like code the bgm into each

3986
01:46:09,910 --> 01:46:09,920
implement like code the bgm into each
 

3987
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:11,510
implement like code the bgm into each
stage like into the

3988
01:46:11,510 --> 01:46:11,520
stage like into the
 

3989
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:13,870
stage like into the
game now we ran out of time so that

3990
01:46:13,870 --> 01:46:13,880
game now we ran out of time so that
 

3991
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:15,589
game now we ran out of time so that
didn't happen but that was still the

3992
01:46:15,589 --> 01:46:15,599
didn't happen but that was still the
 

3993
01:46:15,599 --> 01:46:18,109
didn't happen but that was still the
plan until the like 30 minutes before

3994
01:46:18,109 --> 01:46:18,119
plan until the like 30 minutes before
 

3995
01:46:18,119 --> 01:46:21,990
plan until the like 30 minutes before
the stream so what we did manage to

3996
01:46:21,990 --> 01:46:22,000
the stream so what we did manage to
 

3997
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,709
the stream so what we did manage to
achieve was cing sound effects into the

3998
01:46:24,709 --> 01:46:24,719
achieve was cing sound effects into the
 

3999
01:46:24,719 --> 01:46:29,189
achieve was cing sound effects into the
very last game that was made on time so

4000
01:46:29,189 --> 01:46:29,199
very last game that was made on time so
 

4001
01:46:29,199 --> 01:46:31,070
very last game that was made on time so
if I were to use

4002
01:46:31,070 --> 01:46:31,080
if I were to use
 

4003
01:46:31,080 --> 01:46:33,709
if I were to use
Discord uh

4004
01:46:33,709 --> 01:46:33,719
Discord uh
 

4005
01:46:33,719 --> 01:46:36,589

that you guys weren't able to see the
 

4953
02:10:19,679 --> 02:10:23,669
that you guys weren't able to see the
questions cuz we saw them all

4954
02:10:23,669 --> 02:10:23,679

 

4955
02:10:23,679 --> 02:10:26,470

um yeah that's in h said that was really

embarrassing that you guys couldn't see
the questions there's like certain

4960
02:10:29,709 --> 02:10:29,719
the questions there's like certain
 

4961
02:10:29,719 --> 02:10:30,629
the questions there's like certain
things

4962
02:10:30,629 --> 02:10:30,639
things
 

4963
02:10:30,639 --> 02:10:32,910
things
that like for example the egg on the

4964
02:10:32,910 --> 02:10:32,920
that like for example the egg on the
 

4965
02:10:32,920 --> 02:10:36,629
that like for example the egg on the
spoon as well we realized that when I

4966
02:10:36,629 --> 02:10:36,639
spoon as well we realized that when I
 

4967
02:10:36,639 --> 02:10:39,510
spoon as well we realized that when I
picked up the spoon when we were testing

4968
02:10:39,510 --> 02:10:39,520
picked up the spoon when we were testing
 

4969
02:10:39,520 --> 02:10:41,950
picked up the spoon when we were testing
it that the egg was visible to me but it

4970
02:10:41,950 --> 02:10:41,960
it that the egg was visible to me but it
 

4971
02:10:41,960 --> 02:10:44,390
it that the egg was visible to me but it
wasn't visible to any other

4972
02:10:44,390 --> 02:10:44,400
wasn't visible to any other
 

4973
02:10:44,400 --> 02:10:47,589
wasn't visible to any other
player and then

4974
02:10:47,589 --> 02:10:47,599
player and then
 

4975
02:10:47,599 --> 02:10:49,669
player and then
supposedly that was

4976
02:10:49,669 --> 02:10:49,679
supposedly that was
 

4977
02:10:49,679 --> 02:10:51,790
supposedly that was
fixed we f

4978
02:10:51,790 --> 02:10:51,800
fixed we f
 

4979
02:10:51,800 --> 02:10:54,669
fixed we f
so but then there was no time to uh test

4980
02:10:54,669 --> 02:10:54,679
so but then there was no time to uh test
 

4981
02:10:54,679 --> 02:10:56,310
so but then there was no time to uh test
the fixed version and I just had to

4982
02:10:56,310 --> 02:10:56,320
the fixed version and I just had to
 

4983
02:10:56,320 --> 02:10:59,310
the fixed version and I just had to
trust it and turns out they could not

4984
02:10:59,310 --> 02:10:59,320
trust it and turns out they could not
 

4985
02:10:59,320 --> 02:11:01,790
trust it and turns out they could not
see my egg and you guys couldn't see it

4986
02:11:01,790 --> 02:11:01,800
see my egg and you guys couldn't see it
 

4987
02:11:01,800 --> 02:11:03,750
see my egg and you guys couldn't see it
either I guess the egg on the spoon but

4988
02:11:03,750 --> 02:11:03,760
either I guess the egg on the spoon but
 

4989
02:11:03,760 --> 02:11:05,310
either I guess the egg on the spoon but
there was an egg and it was really

4990
02:11:05,310 --> 02:11:05,320
there was an egg and it was really
 

4991
02:11:05,320 --> 02:11:07,510
there was an egg and it was really
really wobbling I was like I was

4992
02:11:07,510 --> 02:11:07,520
really wobbling I was like I was
 

4993
02:11:07,520 --> 02:11:09,229
really wobbling I was like I was
thinking maybe my idea is too ambitious

4994
02:11:09,229 --> 02:11:09,239
thinking maybe my idea is too ambitious
 

4995
02:11:09,239 --> 02:11:12,470
thinking maybe my idea is too ambitious
to implement to make a game in VR chat

4996
02:11:12,470 --> 02:11:12,480
to implement to make a game in VR chat
 

4997
02:11:12,480 --> 02:11:15,510
to implement to make a game in VR chat
from scratch where you pick up a spoon

4998
02:11:15,510 --> 02:11:15,520
from scratch where you pick up a spoon
 

4999
02:11:15,520 --> 02:11:18,310
from scratch where you pick up a spoon
and it works no matter if you're in

5000
02:11:18,310 --> 02:11:18,320
and it works no matter if you're in
 

5001
02:11:18,320 --> 02:11:21,310
and it works no matter if you're in
desktop mode or in VR but ideally I said

5002
02:11:21,310 --> 02:11:21,320
desktop mode or in VR but ideally I said
 

5003
02:11:21,320 --> 02:11:23,069
desktop mode or in VR but ideally I said
let's just let the VR players play this

5004
02:11:23,069 --> 02:11:23,079
let's just let the VR players play this
 

5005
02:11:23,079 --> 02:11:26,109
let's just let the VR players play this
game cuz then you wobble you you move

5006
02:11:26,109 --> 02:11:26,119
game cuz then you wobble you you move
 

5007
02:11:26,119 --> 02:11:28,510
game cuz then you wobble you you move
your body IRL so the egg will definitely

5008
02:11:28,510 --> 02:11:28,520
your body IRL so the egg will definitely
 

5009
02:11:28,520 --> 02:11:30,510
your body IRL so the egg will definitely
wobble but even for desktop it was

5010
02:11:30,510 --> 02:11:30,520
wobble but even for desktop it was
 

5011
02:11:30,520 --> 02:11:33,669
wobble but even for desktop it was
working you pick up the spoon the egg

5012
02:11:33,669 --> 02:11:33,679
working you pick up the spoon the egg
 

5013
02:11:33,679 --> 02:11:35,669
working you pick up the spoon the egg
wobbles and there's obstacles coming at

5014
02:11:35,669 --> 02:11:35,679
wobbles and there's obstacles coming at
 

5015
02:11:35,679 --> 02:11:38,510
wobbles and there's obstacles coming at
you originally the idea was that you

5016
02:11:38,510 --> 02:11:38,520
you originally the idea was that you
 

5017
02:11:38,520 --> 02:11:41,030
you originally the idea was that you
walk a

5018
02:11:41,030 --> 02:11:41,040
walk a
 

5019
02:11:41,040 --> 02:11:44,270
walk a
path and you work towards the obstacles

5020
02:11:44,270 --> 02:11:44,280
path and you work towards the obstacles
 

5021
02:11:44,280 --> 02:11:46,270
path and you work towards the obstacles
and all that but uh the way it turned

5022
02:11:46,270 --> 02:11:46,280
and all that but uh the way it turned
 

5023
02:11:46,280 --> 02:11:48,430
and all that but uh the way it turned
out to be in the end made way more sense

5024
02:11:48,430 --> 02:11:48,440
out to be in the end made way more sense
 

5025
02:11:48,440 --> 02:11:50,950
out to be in the end made way more sense
because you can't walk really far IRL in

5026
02:11:50,950 --> 02:11:50,960
because you can't walk really far IRL in
 

5027
02:11:50,960 --> 02:11:52,910
because you can't walk really far IRL in
v are depending on how big your room is

5028
02:11:52,910 --> 02:11:52,920
v are depending on how big your room is
 

5029
02:11:52,920 --> 02:11:54,990
v are depending on how big your room is
and how long the cable is and all that

5030
02:11:54,990 --> 02:11:55,000
and how long the cable is and all that
 

5031
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:58,510
and how long the cable is and all that
so this way it's better um but yeah that

5032
02:11:58,510 --> 02:11:58,520
so this way it's better um but yeah that
 

5033
02:11:58,520 --> 02:12:01,109
so this way it's better um but yeah that
was great because my exg I was actually

5034
02:12:01,109 --> 02:12:01,119
was great because my exg I was actually
 

5035
02:12:01,119 --> 02:12:02,589
was great because my exg I was actually
I was so surprised everybody else was

5036
02:12:02,589 --> 02:12:02,599
I was so surprised everybody else was
 

5037
02:12:02,599 --> 02:12:06,149
I was so surprised everybody else was
doing so well in the in the the spoon

5038
02:12:06,149 --> 02:12:06,159
doing so well in the in the the spoon
 

5039
02:12:06,159 --> 02:12:10,990
doing so well in the in the the spoon
thingy game because I was first up and I

5040
02:12:10,990 --> 02:12:11,000
thingy game because I was first up and I
 

5041
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:14,790
thingy game because I was first up and I
was really struggling I was getting down

5042
02:12:14,790 --> 02:12:14,800
was really struggling I was getting down
 

5043
02:12:14,800 --> 02:12:18,149
was really struggling I was getting down
IRL on the ground and all that to dodge

5044
02:12:18,149 --> 02:12:18,159
IRL on the ground and all that to dodge
 

5045
02:12:18,159 --> 02:12:20,189
IRL on the ground and all that to dodge
but apparently I was still too big maybe

5046
02:12:20,189 --> 02:12:20,199
but apparently I was still too big maybe
 

5047
02:12:20,199 --> 02:12:24,350
but apparently I was still too big maybe
it was the model side

5048
02:12:24,350 --> 02:12:24,360

 

5049
02:12:24,360 --> 02:12:26,510

maybe my frogy waa model was like bigger

5050
02:12:26,510 --> 02:12:26,520
maybe my frogy waa model was like bigger
 

5051
02:12:26,520 --> 02:12:28,750
maybe my frogy waa model was like bigger
than the others or so I don't know what

5052
02:12:28,750 --> 02:12:28,760
than the others or so I don't know what
 

5053
02:12:28,760 --> 02:12:31,470
than the others or so I don't know what
was going on but I dropped my eggs so

5054
02:12:31,470 --> 02:12:31,480
was going on but I dropped my eggs so
 

5055
02:12:31,480 --> 02:12:32,870
was going on but I dropped my eggs so
many times and they just like

5056
02:12:32,870 --> 02:12:32,880
many times and they just like
 

5057
02:12:32,880 --> 02:12:35,310

quiet during the whole stream and I was
 

5069
02:12:49,040 --> 02:12:51,270
quiet during the whole stream and I was
a bit worried but uh seems like that's

5070

a bit worried but uh seems like that's
 

5071
02:12:51,280 --> 02:12:53,030
a bit worried but uh seems like that's
what she was up to just staring into

5077
02:12:58,920 --> 02:13:02,310
Soul yeah maybe I can't really tell cuz
I was in VR couldn't really judge if

5078
02:13:02,310 --> 02:13:02,320
I was in VR couldn't really judge if
 

5079
02:13:02,320 --> 02:13:03,709

5379
02:19:38,760 --> 02:19:42,549

uh like it was like on weird angles it

5380
02:19:42,549 --> 02:19:42,559
uh like it was like on weird angles it
 

5381
02:19:42,559 --> 02:19:44,669
uh like it was like on weird angles it
wasn't showing the eggs for example or

5382
02:19:44,669 --> 02:19:44,679
wasn't showing the eggs for example or
 

5383
02:19:44,679 --> 02:19:46,830
wasn't showing the eggs for example or
close-ups of the members and so on so I

5384
02:19:46,830 --> 02:19:46,840
close-ups of the members and so on so I
 

5385
02:19:46,840 --> 02:19:48,870
close-ups of the members and so on so I
was like is it broken is it working

5386
02:19:48,870 --> 02:19:48,880
was like is it broken is it working
 

5387
02:19:48,880 --> 02:19:50,110
was like is it broken is it working
what's happening and that stressed me

5388
02:19:50,110 --> 02:19:50,120
what's happening and that stressed me
 

5389
02:19:50,120 --> 02:19:52,590
what's happening and that stressed me
out too but I think it's like a we just

5390
02:19:52,590 --> 02:19:52,600
out too but I think it's like a we just
 

5391
02:19:52,600 --> 02:19:53,910
out too but I think it's like a we just
didn't have

5392
02:19:53,910 --> 02:19:53,920
didn't have
 

5393
02:19:53,920 --> 02:19:57,870
didn't have
uh the right angles prepared for that

5394
02:19:57,870 --> 02:19:57,880
uh the right angles prepared for that
 

5395
02:19:57,880 --> 02:20:01,230
uh the right angles prepared for that
area maybe again so that would have been

5396
02:20:01,230 --> 02:20:01,240
area maybe again so that would have been
 

5397
02:20:01,240 --> 02:20:03,230
area maybe again so that would have been
a good thing that we we should have uh

5398
02:20:03,230 --> 02:20:03,240
a good thing that we we should have uh
 

5399
02:20:03,240 --> 02:20:07,389
a good thing that we we should have uh
adjusted and attach uh uh and tested out

5400
02:20:07,389 --> 02:20:07,399
adjusted and attach uh uh and tested out
 

5401
02:20:07,399 --> 02:20:10,030
adjusted and attach uh uh and tested out
properly but yeah some of the angles are

5402
02:20:10,030 --> 02:20:10,040
properly but yeah some of the angles are
 

5403
02:20:10,040 --> 02:20:11,910
properly but yeah some of the angles are
just like kind of set in

5404
02:20:11,910 --> 02:20:11,920
just like kind of set in
 

5405
02:20:11,920 --> 02:20:13,429
just like kind of set in
stone

5406
02:20:13,429 --> 02:20:13,439
stone
 

5407
02:20:13,439 --> 02:20:16,270
stone
and can't really be

5408
02:20:16,270 --> 02:20:16,280
and can't really be
 

5409
02:20:16,280 --> 02:20:19,910
and can't really be
changed it's not as flexible so it is

5410
02:20:19,910 --> 02:20:19,920
changed it's not as flexible so it is
 

5411
02:20:19,920 --> 02:20:23,870
changed it's not as flexible so it is
what it is

5412
02:20:23,870 --> 02:20:23,880

 

5413
02:20:23,880 --> 02:20:25,309

yeah it's hard to predict what angles

5414
02:20:25,309 --> 02:20:25,319
yeah it's hard to predict what angles
 

5415
02:20:25,319 --> 02:20:27,550
yeah it's hard to predict what angles
there would be what what angles would be

5416
02:20:27,550 --> 02:20:27,560
there would be what what angles would be
 

5417
02:20:27,560 --> 02:20:30,190
there would be what what angles would be
necessary where the members would

5418
02:20:30,190 --> 02:20:30,200
necessary where the members would
 

5419
02:20:30,200 --> 02:20:35,150
necessary where the members would
be yeah so maybe if we showed off the

5420
02:20:35,150 --> 02:20:35,160
be yeah so maybe if we showed off the
 

5421
02:20:35,160 --> 02:20:37,510
be yeah so maybe if we showed off the
eggs like took the egg and then go to

5422
02:20:37,510 --> 02:20:37,520
eggs like took the egg and then go to
 

5423
02:20:37,520 --> 02:20:38,830
eggs like took the egg and then go to
the couch area maybe that would have

5424
02:20:38,830 --> 02:20:38,840
the couch area maybe that would have
 

5425
02:20:38,840 --> 02:20:41,630
the couch area maybe that would have
been better so sorry for the confusion

5426
02:20:41,630 --> 02:20:41,640
been better so sorry for the confusion
 

5427
02:20:41,640 --> 02:20:44,990
been better so sorry for the confusion
like I was genuinely confused as

5428
02:20:44,990 --> 02:20:45,000
like I was genuinely confused as
 

5429
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:49,349
like I was genuinely confused as
well but yeah it was fine I think uh I

5430
02:20:49,349 --> 02:20:49,359
well but yeah it was fine I think uh I

didn't rewatch The Stream or anything
 

5433
02:20:51,160 --> 02:20:54,309
didn't rewatch The Stream or anything
but the angles seemed to be better later

5434
02:20:54,309 --> 02:20:54,319
but the angles seemed to be better later
 

5435
02:20:54,319 --> 02:20:56,469
but the angles seemed to be better later

because her turn was so late she kind of
 

5449
02:21:15,319 --> 02:21:17,389
because her turn was so late she kind of

was on desktop mode so she could
 

5467
02:21:34,840 --> 02:21:38,309
was on desktop mode so she could
activate her sound effects I guess like

5468
