um and I was like monitoring the data
 

10203
05:23:13,080 --> 05:23:15,350
um and I was like monitoring the data
usage and all that but it it's so weird

10204
05:23:15,350 --> 05:23:15,360
usage and all that but it it's so weird
 

10205
05:23:15,360 --> 05:23:17,788
usage and all that but it it's so weird
it was so confusing

10206
05:23:17,788 --> 05:23:17,798
it was so confusing
 

10207
05:23:17,798 --> 05:23:20,910
it was so confusing
looking and at least for a certain while

10208
05:23:20,910 --> 05:23:20,920
looking and at least for a certain while

solved by just taking out one of the

10224
05:23:49,270 --> 05:23:49,280
solved by just taking out one of the
 

10225
05:23:49,280 --> 05:23:52,110
solved by just taking out one of the
um one of the SIM

10226
05:23:52,110 --> 05:23:52,120
um one of the SIM
 

10227

10231
05:23:57,520 --> 05:23:59,430
cuz it worried me too much um but I I
think I needed the other SIM card

10232
05:23:59,430 --> 05:23:59,440
think I needed the other SIM card
 

10233
05:23:59,440 --> 05:24:01,310
