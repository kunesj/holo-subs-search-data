for a short stream relatively short i
 

203
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,390
for a short stream relatively short i
might do it longer because i got more

204
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:52,400
might do it longer because i got more
 

205
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,189
might do it longer because i got more

if you give people like a deadline of

248
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:43,360
if you give people like a deadline of
 

249
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,350
if you give people like a deadline of
one week later or so

250
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:45,360
one week later or so
 

251
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,990
one week later or so
they will probably forget about it they

252
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,000
they will probably forget about it they
 

253
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,670
they will probably forget about it they
will be like oh i can do it then in two

254
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:49,680
will be like oh i can do it then in two
 

255
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,350
will be like oh i can do it then in two
days or so i could i don't have to do it

days or so i could i don't have to do it
 

257
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,309

258
00:07:54,309 --> 00:07:54,319
now so there's no sense of urgency right
 

259
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,110
now so there's no sense of urgency right
so

260
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,120
so
 

261
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,350
so

262
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:57,360
actually i think the smartest choice
 

263
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,350
actually i think the smartest choice
