there's a cat on the on the picture
 

2097
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,109
there's a cat on the on the picture
so it's like just a random cat either

2098
00:48:15,109 --> 00:48:15,119
so it's like just a random cat either
 

2099
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:17,589
so it's like just a random cat either
walking across the street or sitting on

uh
and then

2156
00:49:28,069 --> 00:49:28,079
and then
 

2157
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:29,589

yeah you know we went for the first

2158
00:49:29,589 --> 00:49:29,599
yeah you know we went for the first
 

2159
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,990
yeah you know we went for the first
round easily and then we were like let's

2160
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:32,000
round easily and then we were like let's
 

2161
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,829
round easily and then we were like let's
do another round this one was too easy

2162
00:49:33,829 --> 00:49:33,839
do another round this one was too easy
 

2163
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:36,309
do another round this one was too easy
and then we figured out oh [\h__\h] there's

2164
00:49:36,309 --> 00:49:36,319
and then we figured out oh [\h__\h] there's
