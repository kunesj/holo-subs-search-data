2194
01:41:43,990 --> 01:41:44,000

2227
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:28,589
or be caught basically yeah yeah is it I
don't know it it's basically you have to

2228
01:42:28,589 --> 01:42:28,599
don't know it it's basically you have to

01:42:32,639 --> 01:42:34,430
but that requires some knowledge about
whole life because there might be some

2234
01:42:34,430 --> 01:42:34,440
whole life because there might be some
 

2235
01:42:34,440 --> 01:42:36,990
whole life because there might be some

just really slow I wonder how fast the

3433
02:12:00,990 --> 02:12:01,000
just really slow I wonder how fast the
 

3434
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,069
just really slow I wonder how fast the
others will be but if you think about it

3435
02:12:03,069 --> 02:12:03,079
others will be but if you think about it
 

3436
02:12:03,079 --> 02:12:05,069
others will be but if you think about it
it's safer to go somewhat slow because

3437
02:12:05,069 --> 02:12:05,079
it's safer to go somewhat slow because
 

3438
02:12:05,079 --> 02:12:07,069
it's safer to go somewhat slow because
if you go too fast and you fall down you

3439
02:12:07,069 --> 02:12:07,079
if you go too fast and you fall down you
 

3440
02:12:07,079 --> 02:12:09,750
if you go too fast and you fall down you
keep on falling down and so maybe it's

02:12:09,750 --> 02:12:09,760
keep on falling down and so maybe it's
 

3442
02:12:09,760 --> 02:12:11,270
keep on falling down and so maybe it's
good to be somewhat

so this is the first time what so if I'm
if I'm on the cool down from the long

4681
02:41:30,910 --> 02:41:30,920
if I'm on the cool down from the long
 

4682
02:41:30,920 --> 02:41:34,790

one maybe I go short with this one how
 

4684
02:41:34,800 --> 02:41:37,510
one maybe I go short with this one how
short oh okay we got to test how short

4685
02:41:37,510 --> 02:41:37,520
short oh okay we got to test how short
 

4686
02:41:37,520 --> 02:41:40,070
short oh okay we got to test how short
the short one really

to be some people who are good at it but
 

4990
02:48:35,960 --> 02:48:37,190
to be some people who are good at it but
I feel like most people probably be

4991

5328
02:56:16,960 --> 02:56:18,950
yeah and it's it's been kind of a long

the next one being the last one I feel
like it' even be kind of awkward to just

5333
02:56:22,269 --> 02:56:22,279
like it' even be kind of awkward to just
 

5334
02:56:22,279 --> 02:56:24,630
like it' even be kind of awkward to just
randomly bring it back for one yeah do

5335
02:56:24,630 --> 02:56:24,640
randomly bring it back for one yeah do
 

5336
02:56:24,640 --> 02:56:26,309
randomly bring it back for one yeah do

5340
02:56:28,479 --> 02:56:30,309
planning to end it uh with the next one

5341
02:56:30,309 --> 02:56:30,319
yeah at least I know I talked about it
 

5342
02:56:30,319 --> 02:56:31,830
yeah at least I know I talked about it
and I was like okay yeah we're just

5343
02:56:31,830 --> 02:56:31,840
and I was like okay yeah we're just
 

5344
02:56:31,840 --> 02:56:33,830
and I was like okay yeah we're just
gonna we're gonna make the last one

5345
02:56:33,830 --> 02:56:33,840
gonna we're gonna make the last one
 

5346
02:56:33,840 --> 02:56:36,389
gonna we're gonna make the last one
finish off act one and then no we didn't

5347
02:56:36,389 --> 02:56:36,399
finish off act one and then no we didn't
 

5348
02:56:36,399 --> 02:56:37,830
finish off act one and then no we didn't
talk about it again yeah I never

5349
02:56:37,830 --> 02:56:37,840
talk about it again yeah I never
 

5350
02:56:37,840 --> 02:56:40,550
talk about it again yeah I never
mentioned it but you know it's just like

5351
02:56:40,550 --> 02:56:40,560
mentioned it but you know it's just like
 

5352
02:56:40,560 --> 02:56:43,030
mentioned it but you know it's just like
as you can see even now even scheduling

5353
02:56:43,030 --> 02:56:43,040
as you can see even now even scheduling
 

5354
02:56:43,040 --> 02:56:45,070
as you can see even now even scheduling
the last one eventually you will run

5355
02:56:45,070 --> 02:56:45,080
the last one eventually you will run
 

5356
02:56:45,080 --> 02:56:47,070
the last one eventually you will run
into bumps where people just are too

5357
02:56:47,070 --> 02:56:47,080
into bumps where people just are too
 

5358
02:56:47,080 --> 02:56:50,429
into bumps where people just are too
busy and so it's difficult to have such

5359
02:56:50,429 --> 02:56:50,439
busy and so it's difficult to have such
 

5360
02:56:50,439 --> 02:56:52,630
busy and so it's difficult to have such
a long running collab with four people

5361
02:56:52,630 --> 02:56:52,640
a long running collab with four people
 

5362
02:56:52,640 --> 02:56:54,550
a long running collab with four people
with two people it's still manageable I

5363
02:56:54,550 --> 02:56:54,560
with two people it's still manageable I
 

5364
02:56:54,560 --> 02:56:57,510
with two people it's still manageable I
think totally yeah but four people and

5365
02:56:57,510 --> 02:56:57,520
think totally yeah but four people and
 

5366
02:56:57,520 --> 02:57:01,389
think totally yeah but four people and
then the problem is like we made a team

5367
02:57:01,389 --> 02:57:01,399
then the problem is like we made a team
 

5368
02:57:01,399 --> 02:57:04,469
then the problem is like we made a team
that consists of like kind of four

5369
02:57:04,469 --> 02:57:04,479
that consists of like kind of four
 

5370
02:57:04,479 --> 02:57:07,870
that consists of like kind of four
different time zones yeah and three of

5371
02:57:07,870 --> 02:57:07,880
different time zones yeah and three of
 

5372
02:57:07,880 --> 02:57:11,269
different time zones yeah and three of
them are very far apart mhm so it it was

5373
02:57:11,269 --> 02:57:11,279
them are very far apart mhm so it it was
 

5374
02:57:11,279 --> 02:57:12,950
them are very far apart mhm so it it was
never really realistic that we would

5375
02:57:12,950 --> 02:57:12,960
never really realistic that we would
 

5376
02:57:12,960 --> 02:57:15,150
never really realistic that we would
play Until the End

5377
02:57:15,150 --> 02:57:15,160
play Until the End
 

5378
02:57:15,160 --> 02:57:18,469

aiming highest is always preferable that

5839
03:08:17,469 --> 03:08:17,479

03:08:21,990 --> 03:08:22,000
certainly
 

5844
03:08:22,000 --> 03:08:24,870
certainly
it unless the platform is pretty much

5845
03:08:24,870 --> 03:08:24,880
it unless the platform is pretty much

Straight Ahead then I want to be careful

5847
03:08:27,469 --> 03:08:27,479
Straight Ahead then I want to be careful
 

5848
03:08:27,479 --> 03:08:32,590
Straight Ahead then I want to be careful
with where I'm

5849
03:08:32,590 --> 03:08:32,600

 

5850
03:08:32,600 --> 03:08:35,429

aiming I guess you could do this one

5851
03:08:35,429 --> 03:08:35,439
aiming I guess you could do this one
 

5852
03:08:35,439 --> 03:08:37,309
aiming I guess you could do this one
here short if you have the time to jump

5853
03:08:37,309 --> 03:08:37,319
here short if you have the time to jump
 

5854
03:08:37,319 --> 03:08:38,870
here short if you have the time to jump
up on the top

5855
03:08:38,870 --> 03:08:38,880
up on the top
 

5856
03:08:38,880 --> 03:08:41,510
up on the top
block and then here is a bit interesting

5857
03:08:41,510 --> 03:08:41,520
block and then here is a bit interesting
 

5858
03:08:41,520 --> 03:08:45,070
block and then here is a bit interesting
because there's a middle platform

5859
03:08:45,070 --> 03:08:45,080

 

5860
03:08:45,080 --> 03:08:48,990

that you want to reach first and

5861
03:08:48,990 --> 03:08:49,000

 

5862
03:08:49,000 --> 03:08:52,990

then it didn't work I charged it too too

5863
03:08:52,990 --> 03:08:53,000
then it didn't work I charged it too too
 

5864
03:08:53,000 --> 03:08:56,030
then it didn't work I charged it too too
too

block up
 

5870
03:09:01,279 --> 03:09:03,550
block up
here then like

5871
03:09:03,550 --> 03:09:03,560
