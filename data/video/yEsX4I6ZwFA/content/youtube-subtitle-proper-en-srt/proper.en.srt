00:00:01,752 --> 00:00:04,188
​​<i>​ ​But in this day and age,​ ​</i>​
​<i>​ ​the smart move is to go low-risk​ ​</i>​

3
00:00:04,188 --> 00:00:05,656
​​<i>​ ​and diversify your revenue streams.​ ​</i>​

4
00:00:04,989 --> 00:00:05,089
​​<i>​ ​​​ ​</i>​

5
00:00:05,656 --> 00:00:08,392
​​<i>​ ​It'd be good to have a new branch​ ​</i>​
​<i>​ ​focused on maximizing profits.​ ​</i>​

6
00:00:08,392 --> 00:00:09,493

​​​ ​Huh?​ ​​

16
00:00:24,575 --> 00:00:25,175

17
00:00:25,175 --> 00:00:26,677
​​​ ​the quarter-pounder phoenix sandwich​ ​​

18
00:00:26,677 --> 00:00:28,045

​​​ ​I don't know!​ ​​

22
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:31,448
​​​ ​I don't have a clue!​ ​​

23
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:32,249
​​​ ​Our menu's too varied!​ ​​

24
00:00:32,249 --> 00:00:34,018
​​​ ​Nobody can tell the difference anyway.​ ​​

25
00:00:34,018 --> 00:00:34,985
​​​ ​Let's just serve this.​ ​​

26
00:00:34,985 --> 00:00:36,153

00:00:57,241 --> 00:00:58,575
​​​ ​Urgh!​ ​​

54
00:00:58,575 --> 00:01:00,544
​​​ ​I'm doing my best here, you know!​ ​​

55
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:00,544
​​​ ​Boss...​ ​​

56
00:01:00,544 --> 00:01:02,312
​​​ ​Let me go cull some customers.​ ​​

57
00:01:01,378 --> 00:01:02,312
​​​ ​Boss?!​ ​​

58
00:01:10,454 --> 00:01:11,488

​​​ ​No, but I've got rice balls!​ ​​

65
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:21,765
​​​ ​Whose order is this, anyway?​ ​​

66
00:01:21,765 --> 00:01:23,333
​​​ ​Believe it or not, nobody!​ ​​

67
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,001
​​​ ​Boss!​ ​​
