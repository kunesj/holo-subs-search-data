this so far it's just simply putting
 

519
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,269
this so far it's just simply putting
things together that look the same way

520
00:14:08,269 --> 00:14:08,279
things together that look the same way
 

521
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:10,310

well what is the double watermelon
 

545
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,230
well what is the double watermelon
configuration so this is how you make a

546
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:40,240
configuration so this is how you make a
 

547
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,189
configuration so this is how you make a
double watermelon I'll show you don't we

548
00:14:42,189 --> 00:14:42,199
double watermelon I'll show you don't we
 

549
00:14:42,199 --> 00:14:44,189
double watermelon I'll show you don't we
already know how to Oh you mean like so

550
00:14:44,189 --> 00:14:44,199
already know how to Oh you mean like so
 

551
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:47,710
already know how to Oh you mean like so
that it fits yeah um I'll show

552
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:47,720
that it fits yeah um I'll show
 

553
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,150
that it fits yeah um I'll show
you these are my screenshots you can see

554
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:50,160
you these are my screenshots you can see
 

555
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,470
you these are my screenshots you can see
how that would be

556
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:51,480
how that would be
 

557
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,990
how that would be
problematic so here's the image um see

558
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:55,000
problematic so here's the image um see
 

559
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,550
problematic so here's the image um see
how once you get the one watermelon you

560
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:56,560
how once you get the one watermelon you
 

561

564
00:15:00,749 --> 00:15:00,759
after that you need to line up the
 

565
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:02,230
after that you need to line up the

the Fatal drop the drop that merges they
 

569
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,189
the Fatal drop the drop that merges they
not deserve to

570
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:07,199
not deserve to
 

571
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,629

that point it's kind of very difficult
 

6443
03:02:23,960 --> 03:02:26,710
that point it's kind of very difficult
to do bosses like that yeah I think

6444
03:02:26,710 --> 03:02:26,720

03:02:42,070 --> 03:02:42,080
a little bit but I guess at that point
 

6461
03:02:42,080 --> 03:02:43,750
a little bit but I guess at that point
it's just kind of like it becomes a bit
