00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:36,180
so I'm thinking maybe maybe I'll just um
 

1331

so I'm thinking maybe maybe I'll just um
I'll maybe I'll play it afterwards

1332
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:40,380
I'll maybe I'll play it afterwards
 

1333
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,650

onwards I think that could work uh yeah
 

1339
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,530

really don't think it is beneficial to

5578
02:26:24,349 --> 02:26:24,359
really don't think it is beneficial to
 

5579
02:26:24,359 --> 02:26:26,090
really don't think it is beneficial to
not be on the moon

5580

not be on the moon
 

5581
02:26:26,100 --> 02:26:28,670
not be on the moon
um my favorite method to do it uh this

5582
02:26:28,670 --> 02:26:28,680
um my favorite method to do it uh this
 

5583
02:26:28,680 --> 02:26:30,110
um my favorite method to do it uh this
map it's a little bit harder but to keep

5584
02:26:30,110 --> 02:26:30,120
map it's a little bit harder but to keep
 

5585
02:26:30,120 --> 02:26:32,090
map it's a little bit harder but to keep
moving in a big circle because they'll

5586

moving in a big circle because they'll
 

5587
02:26:32,100 --> 02:26:33,950
moving in a big circle because they'll
they'll inevitably all kind of get in

they'll inevitably all kind of get in
 

5589
02:26:33,960 --> 02:26:36,610
they'll inevitably all kind of get in
one Circle and it'll be easier

5590
02:26:36,610 --> 02:26:36,620
one Circle and it'll be easier
 

5591
02:26:36,620 --> 02:26:40,010
one Circle and it'll be easier

long it hits you so you kind of have

6176
02:38:51,590 --> 02:38:51,600
long it hits you so you kind of have
 

6177
02:38:51,600 --> 02:38:53,570
long it hits you so you kind of have
some time

6178
02:38:53,570 --> 02:38:53,580

you have basically an extra buff before
 

6183
02:38:58,620 --> 02:39:00,530
you have basically an extra buff before
so that like you get hit but you won't

6184
02:39:00,530 --> 02:39:00,540
so that like you get hit but you won't
 

6185
02:39:00,540 --> 02:39:01,969
so that like you get hit but you won't
get the damage until you exceed a

6186
02:39:01,969 --> 02:39:01,979
get the damage until you exceed a
 

6187
02:39:01,979 --> 02:39:04,730
get the damage until you exceed a
certain hit limit um but no the the they

6188
02:39:04,730 --> 02:39:04,740
certain hit limit um but no the the they
 

6189
02:39:04,740 --> 02:39:06,710
certain hit limit um but no the the they
work differently the the plushie makes

6190
02:39:06,710 --> 02:39:06,720

it so it just you will still get the
 

6193
02:39:08,939 --> 02:39:10,910
it so it just you will still get the
damage but it gives you basically a

6194
02:39:10,910 --> 02:39:10,920
damage but it gives you basically a
 

6195
02:39:10,920 --> 02:39:12,830
damage but it gives you basically a
buffer to go and find Health

6196

6807
02:51:29,160 --> 02:51:31,130
and then we started it in three
different areas that are exactly the

6808
02:51:31,130 --> 02:51:31,140
different areas that are exactly the
 

6809
02:51:31,140 --> 02:51:36,110
different areas that are exactly the
same matching cleaning we're twinning

I don't know I think it's because the

6844
02:52:13,190 --> 02:52:13,200
I don't know I think it's because the
 

6845
02:52:13,200 --> 02:52:15,050
I don't know I think it's because the
skin there is so thin yeah which is one

6846
02:52:15,050 --> 02:52:15,060
skin there is so thin yeah which is one
 

6847
02:52:15,060 --> 02:52:16,429
skin there is so thin yeah which is one
of the same reasons the hair shows

of the same reasons the hair shows
 

6849
02:52:16,439 --> 02:52:18,889
of the same reasons the hair shows
through so easily so it's like the skin
