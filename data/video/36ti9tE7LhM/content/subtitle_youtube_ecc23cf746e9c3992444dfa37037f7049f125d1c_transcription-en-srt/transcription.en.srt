00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:39,260
and then uh ah our R is resetting
 

397
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,090
and then uh ah our R is resetting
and then

00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:15,440

 

539
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,169

00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:28,080
jet crazy
 

549
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,370

okay let's let's start uh using our

550
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:31,380
okay let's let's start uh using our
 

551
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:35,090
okay let's let's start uh using our
brains so I'm guessing that I have to

552
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:35,100
brains so I'm guessing that I have to
 

553
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,510
brains so I'm guessing that I have to
reach this thing like

554
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:38,520
reach this thing like
 

555
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,390
reach this thing like
here wait what did this door ever no it

556
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:41,400
here wait what did this door ever no it
 

557
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,270
here wait what did this door ever no it
didn't it did never

558
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:44,280
didn't it did never
 

559
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,970
didn't it did never
open it's that thing up there

560
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:48,980

 

561
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:52,270

oh god oh

562
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:52,280
oh god oh
 

563
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,250
oh god oh
ah two thousand to eleven thousand per

564
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:55,260
ah two thousand to eleven thousand per
 

565
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,390
ah two thousand to eleven thousand per
billable flight hour

566
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:58,400
billable flight hour
 

567
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,490
billable flight hour
that's actually a bit cheaper than I

568
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:01,500
that's actually a bit cheaper than I
 

569
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,430
that's actually a bit cheaper than I
thought it was gonna be

570
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:04,440
thought it was gonna be
 

571
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,310
thought it was gonna be
when you say flight hour

572
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:07,320
when you say flight hour
 

573
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,049
when you say flight hour
does it really not matter how much

574
00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:09,059
does it really not matter how much
 

575
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:12,409
does it really not matter how much
distance you travel in that hour

576
00:20:12,409 --> 00:20:12,419
distance you travel in that hour
 

577
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,690
distance you travel in that hour
maybe that's where the 2 000 to 11 000

578
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:14,700
maybe that's where the 2 000 to 11 000
 

579
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,830
maybe that's where the 2 000 to 11 000
uh comes from the variation

580
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:18,840
uh comes from the variation
 

581
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:23,090
uh comes from the variation
okay

582
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:23,100

 

583
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:27,710

one hour five minutes jet slide in Japan

584
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:27,720
one hour five minutes jet slide in Japan
 

585
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,490
one hour five minutes jet slide in Japan
next time I'm there yeah Daddy will have

586
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:31,500
next time I'm there yeah Daddy will have
 

587
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,090
next time I'm there yeah Daddy will have
to split it

588
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:34,100
to split it
 

589
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:38,029
to split it
I mean a 2000 if it's really 2 000 for

590
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:38,039
I mean a 2000 if it's really 2 000 for
 

591
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:40,669
I mean a 2000 if it's really 2 000 for
one hour I mean I doubt it it's probably

592
00:20:40,669 --> 00:20:40,679
one hour I mean I doubt it it's probably
 

593
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:43,010
one hour I mean I doubt it it's probably
more like six thousand Japan also seems

594
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:43,020
more like six thousand Japan also seems
 

595
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,590
more like six thousand Japan also seems
like it would be more expensive six six

596
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:45,600
like it would be more expensive six six
 

597
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,350
like it would be more expensive six six
thousand okay let's split it let's split

598
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:48,360
thousand okay let's split it let's split
 

599
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,350
thousand okay let's split it let's split
it after all

600
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:50,360
it after all
 

601
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,770
it after all
oh my god well that's that's surprising

602
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:54,780
oh my god well that's that's surprising
 

603
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,990
oh my god well that's that's surprising
but maybe that's like American Standards

604
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:57,000
but maybe that's like American Standards
 

605
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,970
but maybe that's like American Standards
or so

606
00:20:58,970 --> 00:20:58,980
or so
 

607
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,130
or so
yeah is Yen is cheap is that a good

608
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:01,140
yeah is Yen is cheap is that a good
 

609
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:06,289
yeah is Yen is cheap is that a good
thing uh in terms of private jet

610
00:21:06,289 --> 00:21:06,299

 

611
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:07,669

um

612
00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:07,679
um
 

613
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,210
um
let's look into it yeah only not only

614
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:11,220
let's look into it yeah only not only
 

615
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:14,210
let's look into it yeah only not only
the outlet can do it because it's cheap

616
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:14,220
the outlet can do it because it's cheap
 

617
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,990
the outlet can do it because it's cheap
all right all righty

618
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:18,000
all right all righty
 

619
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,650
all right all righty
so I feel like eventually I do need this

620
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:21,660
so I feel like eventually I do need this
 

621
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,730
so I feel like eventually I do need this
here

622
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:22,740
here
 

623
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:28,490
here
but wait I am already confused why why

624
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:28,500
but wait I am already confused why why
 

625
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,690
but wait I am already confused why why
what do we how does this work again

626
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:32,700
what do we how does this work again
 

627
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,630
what do we how does this work again
the laser oh wait

628
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:35,640
the laser oh wait
 

629
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,490
the laser oh wait
isn't the laser actually already

00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:37,500
isn't the laser actually already
 

631
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,590
isn't the laser actually already
activating that thing oh it does not

have um it's not meant to be activated
when it's not activated then it's

636
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:43,320
when it's not activated then it's
 

637

00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:47,880
I'm turning everybody's brains inside
 

641
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,610
I'm turning everybody's brains inside
out

642
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:49,620
out
 

643
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,590

I would like to bring a cube up there
when I jump

654
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:01,860
when I jump
 

655

ah oh sometimes you have to think
 

665
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:20,090
ah oh sometimes you have to think
outside of the box AKA beat a box

666
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:20,100
outside of the box AKA beat a box
 

667
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,909
outside of the box AKA beat a box
yourself oh and then

668
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:22,919
yourself oh and then
 

669
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:28,490
yourself oh and then
um we rewind the time

670
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:28,500

 

671
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,149

and make it stop

672
00:22:32,149 --> 00:22:32,159

 

673
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,510

when it's intercept

674
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:35,520
when it's intercept
 

675
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,210
when it's intercept
how do I go back

676
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:38,220
how do I go back
 

677
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:42,590
how do I go back
was there a a go back rewind stop rewind

678
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:42,600
was there a a go back rewind stop rewind
 

679
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,930
was there a a go back rewind stop rewind
stop rewind just makes it drop right

680
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:44,940
stop rewind just makes it drop right
 

681
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:49,250
stop rewind just makes it drop right
there right

682
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:49,260

 

683
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:53,409

oh [\h__\h] ah oh never mind stop rewind

684
00:22:53,409 --> 00:22:53,419
oh [\h__\h] ah oh never mind stop rewind
 

685
00:22:53,419 --> 00:22:58,130
oh [\h__\h] ah oh never mind stop rewind
makes it oh go back what what's the way

686
00:22:58,130 --> 00:22:58,140
makes it oh go back what what's the way
 

687
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,649
makes it oh go back what what's the way
to just drop it there was a way to just

688
00:23:00,649 --> 00:23:00,659
to just drop it there was a way to just
 

689
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:04,490
to just drop it there was a way to just
drop it there we go

690
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:04,500

 

691
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,010

yeah okay

692
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:07,020
yeah okay
 

693
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,590
yeah okay
then we have made it we are here with

694
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:09,600
then we have made it we are here with
 

695
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,890
then we have made it we are here with
the cube if it doesn't fall down

696
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:12,900
the cube if it doesn't fall down
 

697
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,330
the cube if it doesn't fall down
okay

698
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:14,340
okay
 

699
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,830
okay
so

700
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:15,840
so
 

701
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,510
so
aha maybe again we do this thing where

702
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:20,520
aha maybe again we do this thing where
 

703
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,610
aha maybe again we do this thing where

00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:53,580
but first the cube
 

761
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,970
but first the cube
yeah and then probably the thing to open

762
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:55,980
yeah and then probably the thing to open
 

763
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,890
yeah and then probably the thing to open
the door over there is one that needs a

764
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:57,900
the door over there is one that needs a
 

765
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,230
the door over there is one that needs a
laser

hold on oh we can just wait we can just

768
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:03,000
hold on oh we can just wait we can just
 

769
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,430
hold on oh we can just wait we can just
fly together

oh [\h__\h] I have an idea that
 

787
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,950
oh [\h__\h] I have an idea that
um we will have this cube move over

788
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:36,960
um we will have this cube move over
 

789
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,690
um we will have this cube move over
there

790
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:38,700
there
 

791
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,610
there
and then back here

792
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:40,620
and then back here
 

793
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:43,010
and then back here
and then basically like where you rewind

794
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:43,020
and then basically like where you rewind
 

795
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,289
and then basically like where you rewind
so it will be there to you know whatever

796
00:25:45,289 --> 00:25:45,299
so it will be there to you know whatever
 

797
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:47,330
so it will be there to you know whatever

is difficult
 

801
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,789
is difficult
but I need this Cube up there so I can't

802
00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:52,799
but I need this Cube up there so I can't
 

803
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,649
but I need this Cube up there so I can't
have it be this Cube I need it to be

804
00:25:54,649 --> 00:25:54,659
have it be this Cube I need it to be
 

805
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:57,169
have it be this Cube I need it to be
this Cube and I think that could work I

806
00:25:57,169 --> 00:25:57,179
this Cube and I think that could work I
 

807
00:25:57,179 --> 00:25:58,730
this Cube and I think that could work I
just need to

808
00:25:58,730 --> 00:25:58,740
just need to
 

809
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:02,870

go back
pretty much quite though repeating

1524
00:45:51,349 --> 00:45:51,359
pretty much quite though repeating
 

1525
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:57,710
pretty much quite though repeating
patterns so it's easy to figure out

1526
00:45:57,710 --> 00:45:57,720

 

1527
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:00,589

you can like do stuff with the laser one
 

1533
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:09,170
you can like do stuff with the laser one
from here but not with the bridge one

1534
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:09,180
from here but not with the bridge one
 

1535
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:11,809

2106
01:02:53,809 --> 01:02:53,819
it doesn't have enough space it's stupid
 

2107
01:02:53,819 --> 01:02:57,289
it doesn't have enough space it's stupid
call Cube needs to be not only tall but

2108
01:02:57,289 --> 01:02:57,299
call Cube needs to be not only tall but
 

2109
01:02:57,299 --> 01:03:00,710
call Cube needs to be not only tall but
also a bit thicker

2110
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:00,720
also a bit thicker

2113
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:07,309

okay why did they open that up for us

okay why did they open that up for us
 

2115
01:03:07,319 --> 01:03:13,609
okay why did they open that up for us
because I was already able to get there

2116
01:03:13,609 --> 01:03:13,619

 

2117
01:03:13,619 --> 01:03:24,290

2123
01:03:35,339 --> 01:03:37,569

because I can't bring him up like that

2124
01:03:37,569 --> 01:03:37,579
because I can't bring him up like that
 

2125
01:03:37,579 --> 01:03:41,930
because I can't bring him up like that
but I can walk around

2126
01:03:41,930 --> 01:03:41,940

 

2127
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:46,789

go up the stairs go through here

2128
01:03:46,789 --> 01:03:46,799
go up the stairs go through here
 

2129
01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:50,630
go up the stairs go through here
yeah okay so I was thinking as well

2130
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:50,640
yeah okay so I was thinking as well
 

2131
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:53,210
yeah okay so I was thinking as well
to try to reach the laser

2132
01:03:53,210 --> 01:03:53,220
to try to reach the laser
 

2133
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:55,130
to try to reach the laser
like this but

2134
01:03:55,130 --> 01:03:55,140
like this but
 

2135
01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:59,030
like this but
if I understand correctly

2136
01:03:59,030 --> 01:03:59,040

 

2137
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,770

then

2138
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:00,780
then
 

2139
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:04,069
then
I can only really send the laser through

2140
01:04:04,069 --> 01:04:04,079
I can only really send the laser through
 

2141
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:08,210
I can only really send the laser through
this not for the windows

2142
01:04:08,210 --> 01:04:08,220

 

2143
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:10,309

wait wait what what is this for then

2144
01:04:10,309 --> 01:04:10,319
wait wait what what is this for then
 

2145
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:14,390
wait wait what what is this for then
what is why did I bring it here then

2146
01:04:14,390 --> 01:04:14,400
what is why did I bring it here then
 

2147
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,150
what is why did I bring it here then
why did I bring it here

2148
01:04:17,150 --> 01:04:17,160
why did I bring it here
 

2149
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:20,450
why did I bring it here
or does the laser

2150
01:04:20,450 --> 01:04:20,460
or does the laser
 

2151
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:22,549
or does the laser
that um

2152
01:04:22,549 --> 01:04:22,559
that um
 

2153
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:26,390
that um
no not the lens does that door up there

2154
01:04:26,390 --> 01:04:26,400
no not the lens does that door up there
 

2155
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,549
no not the lens does that door up there
open as well no wait

2156
01:04:28,549 --> 01:04:28,559

01:04:31,130 --> 01:04:31,140
ah
 

2159
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:35,030
ah
I just saw it

2160
01:04:35,030 --> 01:04:35,040

 

2161
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:36,670

up here

2162
01:04:36,670 --> 01:04:36,680
up here
 

2163
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:39,230
up here
there's an opening a nice opening there

2164
01:04:39,230 --> 01:04:39,240
there's an opening a nice opening there
 

2165
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:41,510
there's an opening a nice opening there
but I feel like I already have

2166
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:41,520
but I feel like I already have
 

2167
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:45,230
but I feel like I already have
too much time on this Cube

2168
01:04:45,230 --> 01:04:45,240
too much time on this Cube
 

2169
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:46,789
too much time on this Cube
which

2170
01:04:46,789 --> 01:04:46,799
which
 

2171
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:50,630
which
um I think maybe is not

2177
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:05,569

because I can walk around but that adds

2178
01:05:05,569 --> 01:05:05,579
because I can walk around but that adds
 

2179
01:05:05,579 --> 01:05:08,829
because I can walk around but that adds
a lot of time to

2180
01:05:08,829 --> 01:05:08,839

would have landed exactly so that the
 

2215
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:22,370
would have landed exactly so that the
laser would Point towards the

laser would Point towards the
 

2217
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:24,370

01:18:55,679 --> 01:18:58,850
hey it was so simple and yet it took me
so much brain power to solve that one

2624
01:18:58,850 --> 01:18:58,860
so much brain power to solve that one
 

2625
01:18:58,860 --> 01:19:01,610
so much brain power to solve that one
but I solved it alone that's all that

2626
01:19:01,610 --> 01:19:01,620
but I solved it alone that's all that
 

2627
01:19:01,620 --> 01:19:02,990
but I solved it alone that's all that
matters

2628
01:19:02,990 --> 01:19:03,000
matters
 

2629
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:08,649
matters
I got to that Solution on my own

01:20:25,130 --> 01:20:25,140
oh well that's an interesting mechanic
 

2679
01:20:25,140 --> 01:20:28,790
oh well that's an interesting mechanic
that I did not see with the trampoline

2680
01:20:28,790 --> 01:20:28,800
that I did not see with the trampoline
 

2681

that I did not see with the trampoline
wow

2682
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:31,920

 

2683
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:36,410

wow um like useless after all

01:20:36,410 --> 01:20:36,420
wow um like useless after all
 

2685
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:39,709
wow um like useless after all
you guys thought yeah

2686
01:20:39,709 --> 01:20:39,719
you guys thought yeah
 

2687
01:20:39,719 --> 01:20:45,350
you guys thought yeah
what is this area for

2688
01:20:45,350 --> 01:20:45,360

 

2689
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:48,410

what is that everything

2690
01:20:48,410 --> 01:20:48,420
what is that everything
 

2691
01:20:48,420 --> 01:20:55,490
what is that everything
ah

2692
01:20:55,490 --> 01:20:55,500

 

2693
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:58,189

but that's not quite explain me what

2694
01:20:58,189 --> 01:20:58,199
but that's not quite explain me what
 

2695
01:20:58,199 --> 01:21:02,030
but that's not quite explain me what
that area is for

2696
01:21:02,030 --> 01:21:02,040

 

2697
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:04,370

yeah unexpected usage right I was like

2698
01:21:04,370 --> 01:21:04,380
yeah unexpected usage right I was like
 

2699
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:06,050
yeah unexpected usage right I was like
looking at that and I was thinking oh

2700
01:21:06,050 --> 01:21:06,060
looking at that and I was thinking oh
 

2701
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:08,990
looking at that and I was thinking oh
this Cube holds that door from shutting

2702
01:21:08,990 --> 01:21:09,000
this Cube holds that door from shutting
 

2703
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,030
this Cube holds that door from shutting
completely so

2704
01:21:11,030 --> 01:21:11,040
completely so
 

2705
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:16,070
completely so
I guess maybe we could lift it ha ha

2706
01:21:16,070 --> 01:21:16,080

 

2707
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:18,110

all right so

2708
01:21:18,110 --> 01:21:18,120
all right so
 

2709
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:19,669
all right so
I'm not sure

2710
01:21:19,669 --> 01:21:19,679
I'm not sure
 

2711
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:23,870
I'm not sure
oh wait we need ah

2712
01:21:23,870 --> 01:21:23,880

 

2713
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:26,750

don't I need the lifting Cube over there

2714
01:21:26,750 --> 01:21:26,760
don't I need the lifting Cube over there
 

2715
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:29,810
don't I need the lifting Cube over there
once I arrive oh wait look there's also

2716
01:21:29,810 --> 01:21:29,820
once I arrive oh wait look there's also
 

2717
01:21:29,820 --> 01:21:34,370
once I arrive oh wait look there's also
wait a second

2718
01:21:34,370 --> 01:21:34,380

 

2719
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:36,169

it's not connected are those two areas

2720
01:21:36,169 --> 01:21:36,179
it's not connected are those two areas
 

2721
01:21:36,179 --> 01:21:40,070
it's not connected are those two areas
connected

2722
01:21:40,070 --> 01:21:40,080

 

2723
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:41,750

let me see

2724
01:21:41,750 --> 01:21:41,760
let me see
 

2725
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:45,950
let me see
I need I need to talk Cube

2726
01:21:45,950 --> 01:21:45,960

 

2727
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:53,209

to elevate myself

2728
01:21:53,209 --> 01:21:53,219

 

2729
01:21:53,219 --> 01:21:57,290

the thing is I was like wondering if

2730
01:21:57,290 --> 01:21:57,300
the thing is I was like wondering if
 

2731
01:21:57,300 --> 01:21:59,810
the thing is I was like wondering if
that's not connected if I could stop in

2732
01:21:59,810 --> 01:21:59,820
that's not connected if I could stop in
 

2733
01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:03,890
that's not connected if I could stop in
the middle to pick up that Cube

2734
01:22:03,890 --> 01:22:03,900

 

2735
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:07,189

um but stopping like releasing the cube

2736
01:22:07,189 --> 01:22:07,199
um but stopping like releasing the cube
 

2737
01:22:07,199 --> 01:22:08,810
um but stopping like releasing the cube
from this platform will only make the

2738
01:22:08,810 --> 01:22:08,820
from this platform will only make the
 

2739
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:10,970
from this platform will only make the
platform go back completely but maybe I

2740
01:22:10,970 --> 01:22:10,980
platform go back completely but maybe I
 

2741
01:22:10,980 --> 01:22:12,830
platform go back completely but maybe I
have to be fast and pick up the cube

2742
01:22:12,830 --> 01:22:12,840
have to be fast and pick up the cube
 

2743
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:16,630
have to be fast and pick up the cube
fast I don't know

2744
01:22:16,630 --> 01:22:16,640

 

2745
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:21,410

Tokyo Tokyo instead of tall Cube

2746
01:22:21,410 --> 01:22:21,420
Tokyo Tokyo instead of tall Cube
 

2747
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:25,610
Tokyo Tokyo instead of tall Cube
Tokyo I think Tokyo no that sounds very

2748
01:22:25,610 --> 01:22:25,620
Tokyo I think Tokyo no that sounds very
 

2749
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:31,750
Tokyo I think Tokyo no that sounds very
different

2750
01:22:31,750 --> 01:22:31,760

 

2751
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:39,970

I'll just do it a few times

2752
01:22:39,970 --> 01:22:39,980

 

2753
01:22:39,980 --> 01:22:46,070

2767
01:23:06,659 --> 01:23:14,930

we need both cubes here in the end

2768
01:23:14,930 --> 01:23:14,940

 

2769
01:23:14,940 --> 01:23:19,130

know how to do it though but first time
 

2773
01:23:21,179 --> 01:23:24,169
know how to do it though but first time
we bring this Cube there then

2774
01:23:24,169 --> 01:23:24,179
we bring this Cube there then
 

2775
01:23:24,179 --> 01:23:33,430
we bring this Cube there then
I think

2776
01:23:33,430 --> 01:23:33,440

 

2777
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:35,770

yeah yeah usually when it's something
like this then the new Cube you acquire

2832
01:25:23,350 --> 01:25:23,360
like this then the new Cube you acquire
 

2833
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:26,689
like this then the new Cube you acquire
you will not you don't you're not

supposed to bring it immediately
immediately to the point where it needs

2838
01:25:30,169 --> 01:25:30,179
immediately to the point where it needs
 

2839
01:25:30,179 --> 01:25:32,390
immediately to the point where it needs
to go this this has been a pattern as

2840
01:25:32,390 --> 01:25:32,400
to go this this has been a pattern as
 

2841
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:33,530
to go this this has been a pattern as
well

2842
01:25:33,530 --> 01:25:33,540

01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:22,070
Gaslight us couldn't they
I know

2976
01:29:22,070 --> 01:29:22,080
I know
 

2977
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:26,750
I know
team meaning okay okay okay

2978
01:29:26,750 --> 01:29:26,760

 

2979
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:29,870

I was thinking exactly that

2980
01:29:29,870 --> 01:29:29,880
I was thinking exactly that
 

2981
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:34,310
I was thinking exactly that
oh

2982
01:29:34,310 --> 01:29:34,320

 

2983
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:39,830

because like wait that implies that Arya

2984
01:29:39,830 --> 01:29:39,840
because like wait that implies that Arya
 

2985
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:43,010
because like wait that implies that Arya
like Arya starting from where we started

2986
01:29:43,010 --> 01:29:43,020
like Arya starting from where we started
 

2987
01:29:43,020 --> 01:29:44,810
like Arya starting from where we started
in the game it felt like she didn't

2988
01:29:44,810 --> 01:29:44,820
in the game it felt like she didn't
 

2989
01:29:44,820 --> 01:29:46,970
in the game it felt like she didn't
really understand that she was doing

2990
01:29:46,970 --> 01:29:46,980
really understand that she was doing
 

2991
01:29:46,980 --> 01:29:49,189
really understand that she was doing
this before so she must have also

2992
01:29:49,189 --> 01:29:49,199
this before so she must have also
 

2993
01:29:49,199 --> 01:29:51,649
this before so she must have also
forgotten that she has ever like

2994
01:29:51,649 --> 01:29:51,659
forgotten that she has ever like
 

2995
01:29:51,659 --> 01:29:55,550
forgotten that she has ever like
received money or solved puzzles before

2996
01:29:55,550 --> 01:29:55,560
received money or solved puzzles before
 

2997
01:29:55,560 --> 01:29:58,010
received money or solved puzzles before
she did not know about this

2998
01:29:58,010 --> 01:29:58,020
she did not know about this
 

2999
01:29:58,020 --> 01:30:00,890
she did not know about this
so that means

3000
01:30:00,890 --> 01:30:00,900
so that means
 

3001
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:03,950
so that means
that even if I was given money I forgot

3002
01:30:03,950 --> 01:30:03,960
that even if I was given money I forgot
 

3003
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:07,490
that even if I was given money I forgot
it already

3004
01:30:07,490 --> 01:30:07,500

 

3005
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:09,470

so they're probably not really paying

3006
01:30:09,470 --> 01:30:09,480
so they're probably not really paying
 

3007
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:11,570
so they're probably not really paying
any of us

3008
01:30:11,570 --> 01:30:11,580
any of us
 

3009
01:30:11,580 --> 01:30:14,270
any of us
because I can't remember this

3010
01:30:14,270 --> 01:30:14,280
because I can't remember this
 

3011
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:19,669
because I can't remember this
whole scheme any oh my God

3012
01:30:19,669 --> 01:30:19,679

probably a bridge Cube maybe there's

3672
01:49:32,090 --> 01:49:32,100
probably a bridge Cube maybe there's
 

3673
01:49:32,100 --> 01:49:36,530
probably a bridge Cube maybe there's
also one somewhere

3674
01:49:36,530 --> 01:49:36,540

 

3675
01:49:36,540 --> 01:49:39,370

let me just

02:21:05,720 --> 02:21:10,250

yeah well I guess I'll have to do it

4724
02:21:10,250 --> 02:21:10,260
yeah well I guess I'll have to do it
 

4725
02:21:10,260 --> 02:21:13,490
yeah well I guess I'll have to do it
um

4726
02:21:13,490 --> 02:21:13,500

 

4727
02:21:13,500 --> 02:21:17,330

twice

4728
02:21:17,330 --> 02:21:17,340

 

4729
02:21:17,340 --> 02:21:27,230

if I reverse it like

4730
02:21:27,230 --> 02:21:27,240

 

4731
02:21:27,240 --> 02:21:32,270

I think it can go back

4732
02:21:32,270 --> 02:21:32,280

 

4733
02:21:32,280 --> 02:21:34,849

no no ah

4734
02:21:34,849 --> 02:21:34,859
no no ah
 

4735
02:21:34,859 --> 02:21:37,750
no no ah
and this time I think I have to re

4736
02:21:37,750 --> 02:21:37,760
and this time I think I have to re
 

4737
02:21:37,760 --> 02:21:40,190
and this time I think I have to re
outrun this because if I reverse this

4738
02:21:40,190 --> 02:21:40,200
outrun this because if I reverse this
 

4739
02:21:40,200 --> 02:21:42,530
outrun this because if I reverse this
doesn't it reset what does it no it

4740
02:21:42,530 --> 02:21:42,540
doesn't it reset what does it no it
 

4741
02:21:42,540 --> 02:21:44,330

doesn't it doesn't reset the Cube's path

4742
02:21:44,330 --> 02:21:44,340
doesn't it doesn't reset the Cube's path
 

4743

5060
02:35:37,849 --> 02:35:37,859
sorry guys I'm kind of weirdly stuck on
 

5061
02:35:37,859 --> 02:35:40,370
sorry guys I'm kind of weirdly stuck on
this one

5062
02:35:40,370 --> 02:35:40,380
this one
 

5063
02:35:40,380 --> 02:35:45,950
this one
I don't know why I'm so stuck here

5064
02:35:45,950 --> 02:35:45,960

 

5065
02:35:45,960 --> 02:35:50,090

okay what if we

5066
02:35:50,090 --> 02:35:50,100

 

5067
02:35:50,100 --> 02:35:52,190

get rid of this

5068
02:35:52,190 --> 02:35:52,200
get rid of this
 

5069
02:35:52,200 --> 02:35:55,130
get rid of this
I know I think hopefully this is not

5070
02:35:55,130 --> 02:35:55,140
I know I think hopefully this is not
 

5071
02:35:55,140 --> 02:36:00,170
I know I think hopefully this is not
just RNG but if I place it here then

5072
02:36:00,170 --> 02:36:00,180
just RNG but if I place it here then
 

5073
02:36:00,180 --> 02:36:02,389
just RNG but if I place it here then
it would hopefully land

5074
02:36:02,389 --> 02:36:02,399
it would hopefully land
 

5075
02:36:02,399 --> 02:36:07,330
it would hopefully land
in theory on the conveyor belt

5076
02:36:07,330 --> 02:36:07,340

 

5077
02:36:07,340 --> 02:36:11,030

so there we go

5078
02:36:11,030 --> 02:36:11,040

 

5079
02:36:11,040 --> 02:36:13,969

and now I bring it

5080
02:36:13,969 --> 02:36:13,979
and now I bring it
 

5081
02:36:13,979 --> 02:36:16,130
and now I bring it
here

5082
02:36:16,130 --> 02:36:16,140
here
 

5083
02:36:16,140 --> 02:36:19,730
here
and we bring back the conveyor belt

5084
02:36:19,730 --> 02:36:19,740

5284
02:43:15,170 --> 02:43:15,180

5293
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:41,809

mark
 

5303
02:43:59,399 --> 02:44:01,370
mark
and that was that's why I first wanted

5304
02:44:01,370 --> 02:44:01,380
and that was that's why I first wanted
 

5305
02:44:01,380 --> 02:44:03,530
and that was that's why I first wanted
to place the trampoline on it but I just

5306
02:44:03,530 --> 02:44:03,540
to place the trampoline on it but I just
 

5307
02:44:03,540 --> 02:44:04,969

5312
02:44:22,690 --> 02:44:22,700

 

5313
02:44:22,700 --> 02:44:25,070

like here if there were a bridge to be
created here I could jump on it and go

hold on let's refresh it though

5492
02:50:23,450 --> 02:50:23,460

 

5493
02:50:23,460 --> 02:50:28,130

thank you

I wonder how you can cheese it I want to

I wonder how you can cheese it I want to
 

5497
02:50:30,600 --> 02:50:35,929
I wonder how you can cheese it I want to
figure it out

5498
02:50:35,929 --> 02:50:35,939

 

5499
02:50:35,939 --> 02:50:38,030

how do you cheese this

5500
02:50:38,030 --> 02:50:38,040
how do you cheese this
 

5501
02:50:38,040 --> 02:50:45,410
how do you cheese this
where is the cheese stretch

5502
02:50:45,410 --> 02:50:45,420

 

5503
02:50:45,420 --> 02:50:50,870

that doesn't that doesn't help

5504
02:50:50,870 --> 02:50:50,880

 

5505
02:50:50,880 --> 02:50:53,510

finding out how to change it I think

5506
02:50:53,510 --> 02:50:53,520
finding out how to change it I think
 

5507
02:50:53,520 --> 02:50:57,110
finding out how to change it I think
requires you to have a couple of brain

5508
02:50:57,110 --> 02:50:57,120
requires you to have a couple of brain
 

5509
02:50:57,120 --> 02:50:58,730
requires you to have a couple of brain

5510

cells
 

5511
02:50:58,740 --> 02:51:01,790
cells
so I think

5512
02:51:01,790 --> 02:51:01,800
so I think
 

5513
02:51:01,800 --> 02:51:04,130
so I think
the fact that you were able to cheese it

5514
02:51:04,130 --> 02:51:04,140
the fact that you were able to cheese it
 

5515
02:51:04,140 --> 02:51:06,650
the fact that you were able to cheese it
makes you very smart and gets you on the

5516
02:51:06,650 --> 02:51:06,660
makes you very smart and gets you on the
 

5517
02:51:06,660 --> 02:51:09,110
makes you very smart and gets you on the
same level as being able to do it

5518
02:51:09,110 --> 02:51:09,120
same level as being able to do it
 

5519
02:51:09,120 --> 02:51:10,610
same level as being able to do it
normally

5520
02:51:10,610 --> 02:51:10,620
normally
 

5521
02:51:10,620 --> 02:51:12,830
normally
so I don't think there is any shame in

5522
02:51:12,830 --> 02:51:12,840
so I don't think there is any shame in
 

5523
02:51:12,840 --> 02:51:14,030
so I don't think there is any shame in
doing that

5524
02:51:14,030 --> 02:51:14,040
doing that
 

5525
02:51:14,040 --> 02:51:19,610
doing that
um

5526
02:51:19,610 --> 02:51:19,620

 

5527
02:51:19,620 --> 02:51:22,190

but I don't know how to cheat
so

5530
02:51:23,870 --> 02:51:23,880
so
 

5531
02:51:23,880 --> 02:51:27,170
so
if it falls down there

5532
02:51:27,170 --> 02:51:27,180
if it falls down there
 

5533
02:51:27,180 --> 02:51:33,590
if it falls down there
we want it to fall like this I think

02:58:09,170 --> 02:58:09,180
she's by glitching the cube near the
 

5719
02:58:09,180 --> 02:58:13,690
she's by glitching the cube near the
treadmill hey

5720

5721
02:58:13,700 --> 02:58:16,730

that's just that sounds like RNG to me

5722
02:58:16,730 --> 02:58:16,740
that's just that sounds like RNG to me
 

5723
02:58:16,740 --> 02:58:18,469
that's just that sounds like RNG to me
and I don't even know how that would

5724
02:58:18,469 --> 02:58:18,479
and I don't even know how that would
 

5725
02:58:18,479 --> 02:58:21,950
and I don't even know how that would
help me

um
 

5731
02:58:25,740 --> 02:58:27,830
um
well it probably has to do something

5732
02:58:27,830 --> 02:58:27,840
well it probably has to do something
 

5733
02:58:27,840 --> 02:58:34,370
well it probably has to do something
with rewinding [\h__\h]

5734
02:58:34,370 --> 02:58:34,380

 

5735
02:58:34,380 --> 02:58:37,550

oh where to my brain I don't know my

5736
02:58:37,550 --> 02:58:37,560
oh where to my brain I don't know my
 

5737
02:58:37,560 --> 02:58:40,250
oh where to my brain I don't know my
capacity my brain capacity is just not

5738
02:58:40,250 --> 02:58:40,260
capacity my brain capacity is just not
 

5739
02:58:40,260 --> 02:58:43,370
capacity my brain capacity is just not
maybe strong today

5740
02:58:43,370 --> 02:58:43,380

 

5741
02:58:43,380 --> 02:58:45,650

02:58:45,650 --> 02:58:45,660
that is glass
 

5743
02:58:45,660 --> 02:58:49,610

that over there is glass yeah
 

5745
02:58:49,620 --> 02:58:52,010
that over there is glass yeah
pretty sure

5746
02:58:52,010 --> 02:58:52,020
pretty sure
 

5747
02:58:52,020 --> 02:58:56,030
pretty sure
yeah it stopped there

5748
02:58:56,030 --> 02:58:56,040

 

5749
02:58:56,040 --> 02:58:58,490

there's a lot of steps to this

5750
02:58:58,490 --> 02:58:58,500
there's a lot of steps to this
 

5751
02:58:58,500 --> 02:59:05,690
there's a lot of steps to this
that makes me not happy not happy at all

5752
02:59:05,690 --> 02:59:05,700

 

5753
02:59:05,700 --> 02:59:06,889

5757
02:59:10,680 --> 02:59:14,210

I I have to jump onto it

5758
02:59:14,210 --> 02:59:14,220
I I have to jump onto it
 

5759
02:59:14,220 --> 02:59:18,530
I I have to jump onto it
from the other side so I have to

5760
02:59:18,530 --> 02:59:18,540
from the other side so I have to
 

5761
02:59:18,540 --> 02:59:22,250
from the other side so I have to
um bring the jumping one

5762
02:59:22,250 --> 02:59:22,260

 

5763
02:59:22,260 --> 02:59:25,730

back there

5764
02:59:25,730 --> 02:59:25,740

 

5765
02:59:25,740 --> 02:59:30,469

job seems very risky and difficult

5766
02:59:30,469 --> 02:59:30,479

 

5767
02:59:30,479 --> 02:59:34,070

oh

take the bridge
jump to the right of the stair is that a

5774
02:59:40,190 --> 02:59:40,200
jump to the right of the stair is that a
 

5775
02:59:40,200 --> 02:59:41,690
jump to the right of the stair is that a
cheese strap

5776
02:59:41,690 --> 02:59:41,700
cheese strap
 

5777
02:59:41,700 --> 02:59:44,030

oh
 

5779
02:59:44,040 --> 02:59:45,650
oh
that sounds like a cheese one because

5780
02:59:45,650 --> 02:59:45,660
that sounds like a cheese one because
 

5781
02:59:45,660 --> 02:59:48,349
that sounds like a cheese one because
you mean one of those rocks over there

5782
02:59:48,349 --> 02:59:48,359
you mean one of those rocks over there
 

5783
02:59:48,359 --> 02:59:50,570
you mean one of those rocks over there

03:00:00,230 --> 03:00:00,240
sounds interesting I don't understand it
 

5793
03:00:00,240 --> 03:00:01,969
sounds interesting I don't understand it
though it went they were in it again

though it went they were in it again
 

5795
03:00:01,979 --> 03:00:03,889
though it went they were in it again
from the start take the bridge jump to

one-room apartment

6150
03:11:12,130 --> 03:11:12,140
one-room apartment
 

6151
03:11:12,140 --> 03:11:15,290
one-room apartment
I guess the showers are shared though I

6152
03:11:15,290 --> 03:11:15,300
I guess the showers are shared though I
 

6153
03:11:15,300 --> 03:11:18,950
I guess the showers are shared though I
don't appreciate that

6154
03:11:18,950 --> 03:11:18,960

 

6155
03:11:18,960 --> 03:11:21,769

um okay I saw something breaking down

6156
03:11:21,769 --> 03:11:21,779
um okay I saw something breaking down
 

6157
03:11:21,779 --> 03:11:29,030
um okay I saw something breaking down
here so am I laying

6158
03:11:29,030 --> 03:11:29,040

 

6159
03:11:29,040 --> 03:11:34,610

supposed to leave you there

6160
03:11:34,610 --> 03:11:34,620

 

6161
03:11:34,620 --> 03:11:39,230

don't think so

6162
03:11:39,230 --> 03:11:39,240

 

6163
03:11:39,240 --> 03:11:42,050

or maybe

6164
03:11:42,050 --> 03:11:42,060
or maybe
 

6165
03:11:42,060 --> 03:11:45,170
or maybe
you have something to lift no

6166
03:11:45,170 --> 03:11:45,180
you have something to lift no
 

6167
03:11:45,180 --> 03:11:50,510
you have something to lift no
and I I don't think this is the way

6168
03:11:50,510 --> 03:11:50,520

 

6169
03:11:50,520 --> 03:11:52,610

must be like

6170
03:11:52,610 --> 03:11:52,620
must be like
 

6171
03:11:52,620 --> 03:11:55,309
must be like
we're going down again

6172
03:11:55,309 --> 03:11:55,319
we're going down again
 

6173
03:11:55,319 --> 03:11:58,370
we're going down again
and then we're going up again or so I

6174
03:11:58,370 --> 03:11:58,380
and then we're going up again or so I
 

6175
03:11:58,380 --> 03:11:59,870
and then we're going up again or so I
don't know

6176
03:11:59,870 --> 03:11:59,880
don't know
 

6177
03:11:59,880 --> 03:12:04,010
don't know
maybe from here

6178
03:12:04,010 --> 03:12:04,020

 

6179
03:12:04,020 --> 03:12:07,250

and then

6180
03:12:07,250 --> 03:12:07,260

 

6181
03:12:07,260 --> 03:12:08,290

oh

6182
03:12:08,290 --> 03:12:08,300

6183
03:12:08,300 --> 03:12:11,630
oh
but something broke down here and that

6184
03:12:11,630 --> 03:12:11,640
but something broke down here and that
 

6185
03:12:11,640 --> 03:12:16,849
but something broke down here and that
must have been for a reason right

6186
03:12:16,849 --> 03:12:16,859

 

6187
03:12:16,859 --> 03:12:19,570

however

6188
03:12:19,570 --> 03:12:19,580
however
 

6189
03:12:19,580 --> 03:12:23,750
however
ah maybe I'm supposed to go up here

6190
03:12:23,750 --> 03:12:23,760

6194
03:12:31,610 --> 03:12:31,620
that's interesting why is it the other
 

6195
03:12:31,620 --> 03:12:35,630
that's interesting why is it the other
way around that's so trippy we go from

6196
03:12:35,630 --> 03:12:35,640
way around that's so trippy we go from
 

6197
03:12:35,640 --> 03:12:38,510
way around that's so trippy we go from
ground floor downwards but in reality

6198
03:12:38,510 --> 03:12:38,520
ground floor downwards but in reality
 

6199
03:12:38,520 --> 03:12:41,030
ground floor downwards but in reality
we're going upwards okay level two to

it was too close and I fell down but I

6360
03:18:31,730 --> 03:18:31,740
it was too close and I fell down but I
 

6361
03:18:31,740 --> 03:18:33,230
it was too close and I fell down but I
wanted to replace it anyway because that

6362
03:18:33,230 --> 03:18:33,240
wanted to replace it anyway because that
 

6363
03:18:33,240 --> 03:18:40,430
wanted to replace it anyway because that
was too close more like maybe here

the cause
 

6571
03:23:57,960 --> 03:24:03,950
the cause
they figured out the cause and told them

6572
03:24:03,950 --> 03:24:03,960

 

6573
03:24:03,960 --> 03:24:07,250

reverse the conveyor belt so it goes

through the red one

through the red one

and goes for the blue one again so then
 

7007
03:36:03,960 --> 03:36:06,410

it's trampoline

then we can use it to jump up there then
we reverse the trampoline it will go

we reverse the trampoline it will go
 

7013

7471
03:54:53,100 --> 03:54:54,469
doesn't it wouldn't even make sense to
put that there in the first place if it

to go through here ah but then I kind of
 

7491
03:55:24,300 --> 03:55:26,330

03:56:33,239 --> 03:56:37,070
I will
I will

7536
03:56:37,070 --> 03:56:37,080

 

7537
03:56:37,080 --> 03:56:39,950

Let It Go through here first and then

7538
03:56:39,950 --> 03:56:39,960
Let It Go through here first and then
 

7539
03:56:39,960 --> 03:56:42,370
Let It Go through here first and then
back again

7540
03:56:42,370 --> 03:56:42,380
back again
 

7541
03:56:42,380 --> 03:56:46,250
back again
I don't know why

7542
03:56:46,250 --> 03:56:46,260

 

7543
03:56:46,260 --> 03:56:49,969

hmm

7544
03:56:49,969 --> 03:56:49,979

 

7545
03:56:49,979 --> 03:56:55,550

maybe I do

7546
03:56:55,550 --> 03:56:55,560

 

7547
03:56:55,560 --> 03:56:58,370

need to maybe all of that was not

7548
03:56:58,370 --> 03:56:58,380
need to maybe all of that was not
 

7549
03:56:58,380 --> 03:57:03,590
need to maybe all of that was not
even necessary

7550
03:57:03,590 --> 03:57:03,600

 

7551
03:57:03,600 --> 03:57:06,710

but I guess my idea was that even if it

7552
03:57:06,710 --> 03:57:06,720
but I guess my idea was that even if it
 

7553
03:57:06,720 --> 03:57:08,929
but I guess my idea was that even if it
goes through backwards

7554
03:57:08,929 --> 03:57:08,939
goes through backwards
 

7555
03:57:08,939 --> 03:57:12,170
goes through backwards
it will still be what it was

7556
03:57:12,170 --> 03:57:12,180
it will still be what it was
 

7557
03:57:12,180 --> 03:57:14,450
it will still be what it was
and if I were to just let it go for the

7558
03:57:14,450 --> 03:57:14,460
and if I were to just let it go for the
 

7559
03:57:14,460 --> 03:57:17,510
and if I were to just let it go for the
blue one and then rewind it after it

7560
03:57:17,510 --> 03:57:17,520
blue one and then rewind it after it
 

7561
03:57:17,520 --> 03:57:19,969
blue one and then rewind it after it
went for the blue one it would go here

7562
03:57:19,969 --> 03:57:19,979
went for the blue one it would go here
 

7563
03:57:19,979 --> 03:57:21,830
went for the blue one it would go here
and then it will

7564
03:57:21,830 --> 03:57:21,840
and then it will
 

7565
03:57:21,840 --> 03:57:26,630
and then it will
go here Lift Me Up go there I jump

7566
03:57:26,630 --> 03:57:26,640
go here Lift Me Up go there I jump
 

7567
03:57:26,640 --> 03:57:28,309
go here Lift Me Up go there I jump

I shall refresh it
 

8069
04:13:53,819 --> 04:13:56,030
I shall refresh it
I mean this is this is probably the

04:13:56,030 --> 04:13:56,040
I mean this is this is probably the
 

8071
04:13:56,040 --> 04:14:00,349
I mean this is this is probably the
beginning right

8072
04:14:00,349 --> 04:14:00,359

 

8073
04:14:00,359 --> 04:14:07,330

8079
04:14:12,840 --> 04:14:15,410

as a jump platform it doesn't really

8080
04:14:15,410 --> 04:14:15,420
as a jump platform it doesn't really
 

8081
04:14:15,420 --> 04:14:17,570
as a jump platform it doesn't really
help me because all the other ones are

8082

help me because all the other ones are
 

8083

help me because all the other ones are
too far away

8084
04:14:22,790 --> 04:14:22,800

 

8085
04:14:22,800 --> 04:14:25,010

ah but I think

8086
04:14:25,010 --> 04:14:25,020
ah but I think
 

8087
04:14:25,020 --> 04:14:29,950
ah but I think
Maybe

8088
04:14:29,950 --> 04:14:29,960

 

8089
04:14:29,960 --> 04:14:33,830

if I am first make it into a bridge

8090
04:14:33,830 --> 04:14:33,840
if I am first make it into a bridge
 

8091
04:14:33,840 --> 04:14:35,990
if I am first make it into a bridge
platform

8092
04:14:35,990 --> 04:14:36,000
platform
 

8093
04:14:36,000 --> 04:14:43,729
platform
if there's enough time bring it up here

8094
04:14:43,729 --> 04:14:43,739

 

8095
04:14:43,739 --> 04:14:45,650

and

8096
04:14:45,650 --> 04:14:45,660
and
 

8097
04:14:45,660 --> 04:14:53,150
and
kind of like place it right here

8098
04:14:53,150 --> 04:14:53,160

 

8099
04:14:53,160 --> 04:14:55,429

I know but let's say let's say I place

8100
04:14:55,429 --> 04:14:55,439
I know but let's say let's say I place
 

8101
04:14:55,439 --> 04:14:57,769
I know but let's say let's say I place
it here

8102
04:14:57,769 --> 04:14:57,779
it here
 

8103
04:14:57,779 --> 04:15:01,269
it here
uh for a moment then run run run run run

8104
04:15:01,269 --> 04:15:01,279
uh for a moment then run run run run run
 

8105
04:15:01,279 --> 04:15:05,630
uh for a moment then run run run run run
place it as a jump platform there

8106
04:15:05,630 --> 04:15:05,640
place it as a jump platform there
 

8107
04:15:05,640 --> 04:15:08,929
place it as a jump platform there
no first first I place it once here and

8108
04:15:08,929 --> 04:15:08,939
no first first I place it once here and
 

8109
04:15:08,939 --> 04:15:10,189
no first first I place it once here and
then there

8110
04:15:10,189 --> 04:15:10,199
then there
 

8111
04:15:10,199 --> 04:15:12,590
then there
is there enough time to do that so I'm

8112
04:15:12,590 --> 04:15:12,600
is there enough time to do that so I'm
 

8113
04:15:12,600 --> 04:15:15,469
is there enough time to do that so I'm
thinking that

8114
04:15:15,469 --> 04:15:15,479
thinking that
 

8115
04:15:15,479 --> 04:15:18,469
thinking that
um the bridge that I create here

8116
04:15:18,469 --> 04:15:18,479
um the bridge that I create here
 

8117
04:15:18,479 --> 04:15:21,469
um the bridge that I create here
I walk on then jump down pill and jump

8118
04:15:21,469 --> 04:15:21,479
I walk on then jump down pill and jump
 

8119
04:15:21,479 --> 04:15:22,490
I walk on then jump down pill and jump
up here

8120
04:15:22,490 --> 04:15:22,500
up here
 

8121
04:15:22,500 --> 04:15:24,469
up here
that's my idea

8122
04:15:24,469 --> 04:15:24,479
that's my idea
 

8123
04:15:24,479 --> 04:15:29,750
that's my idea
but then we're still missing

8124
04:15:29,750 --> 04:15:29,760

 

8125
04:15:29,760 --> 04:15:31,729

the fact that I even need a jump

8126
04:15:31,729 --> 04:15:31,739
the fact that I even need a jump
 

8127
04:15:31,739 --> 04:15:34,189
the fact that I even need a jump
platform no I do need to jump platform

8128
04:15:34,189 --> 04:15:34,199
platform no I do need to jump platform
 

8129
04:15:34,199 --> 04:15:37,550
platform no I do need to jump platform
there how I only have so much time to do

8130
04:15:37,550 --> 04:15:37,560
there how I only have so much time to do
 

8131
04:15:37,560 --> 04:15:39,120
there how I only have so much time to do
all of that in 38 seconds

8132

otherwise I could just place it once
 

8151
04:16:05,640 --> 04:16:07,670

to do this
 

8195
04:17:12,420 --> 04:17:16,490
to do this
so uh uh we're talking jump platform

8196
04:17:16,490 --> 04:17:16,500
so uh uh we're talking jump platform
 

8197
04:17:16,500 --> 04:17:19,189
so uh uh we're talking jump platform
right now so it starts here

8198
04:17:19,189 --> 04:17:19,199
right now so it starts here
 

8199
04:17:19,199 --> 04:17:22,790
right now so it starts here
first try might be not enough

8200
04:17:22,790 --> 04:17:22,800
first try might be not enough
 

8201
04:17:22,800 --> 04:17:26,090

uh tsumari
 

8691
04:31:38,640 --> 04:31:41,510
uh tsumari
first step is

8692
04:31:41,510 --> 04:31:41,520
first step is
 

8693
04:31:41,520 --> 04:31:43,070
first step is
that

8694
04:31:43,070 --> 04:31:43,080
that
 

8695
04:31:43,080 --> 04:31:45,170
that
because the last step is putting the

8696
04:31:45,170 --> 04:31:45,180
because the last step is putting the
 

8697
04:31:45,180 --> 04:31:47,630
because the last step is putting the
bridge there

Let's test it out
 

8701
04:31:50,640 --> 04:31:52,849
Let's test it out
it's fresh

8702
04:31:52,849 --> 04:31:52,859

8705
04:31:55,979 --> 04:31:58,010

so in theory I could already walk over

8706
04:31:58,010 --> 04:31:58,020
so in theory I could already walk over
 

8707
04:31:58,020 --> 04:32:00,290
so in theory I could already walk over
there but this is just the last step

of what I am needed to set up and I
wanted to set it up this week because I

9758
05:02:47,448 --> 05:02:47,458
wanted to set it up this week because I
 

9759

9765
05:02:54,780 --> 05:02:57,350
um which one's not in 100 necessity
um it didn't need to be in 3D but I

9766
05:02:57,350 --> 05:02:57,360
um it didn't need to be in 3D but I
 

9767
05:02:57,360 --> 05:02:59,510
um it didn't need to be in 3D but I
wanted it to be in 3D

9768
05:02:59,510 --> 05:02:59,520
wanted it to be in 3D
 

9769
05:02:59,520 --> 05:03:01,368
wanted it to be in 3D
so I was hoping I knew it wouldn't be

9770
05:03:01,368 --> 05:03:01,378
so I was hoping I knew it wouldn't be
 

9771
05:03:01,378 --> 05:03:03,708
so I was hoping I knew it wouldn't be
perfect but I thought at least you know

9772
05:03:03,708 --> 05:03:03,718
perfect but I thought at least you know
 

9773
05:03:03,718 --> 05:03:07,910

were so
 

9779
05:03:13,458 --> 05:03:16,910
were so
devastatingly destroyed

9780
05:03:16,910 --> 05:03:16,920
devastatingly destroyed
 

9781
05:03:16,920 --> 05:03:19,128
devastatingly destroyed
so I set up everything right and I was

9782
05:03:19,128 --> 05:03:19,138
so I set up everything right and I was
 

9783
05:03:19,138 --> 05:03:20,690
so I set up everything right and I was
up until like

9784
05:03:20,690 --> 05:03:20,700
up until like
 

9785
05:03:20,700 --> 05:03:22,910
up until like
um 4 am setting it up and then I was up

9786
05:03:22,910 --> 05:03:22,920
um 4 am setting it up and then I was up
 

9787
05:03:22,920 --> 05:03:24,530
um 4 am setting it up and then I was up
even longer because I still had to cook

9788
05:03:24,530 --> 05:03:24,540
even longer because I still had to cook
 

9789
05:03:24,540 --> 05:03:28,788
even longer because I still had to cook
but I really needed to get it done

9790
05:03:28,788 --> 05:03:28,798
but I really needed to get it done
 

9791
05:03:28,798 --> 05:03:29,448
but I really needed to get it done
um

9792
05:03:29,448 --> 05:03:29,458
um
 

9793
05:03:29,458 --> 05:03:30,530
um
and

9794
05:03:30,530 --> 05:03:30,540
and
 

9795
05:03:30,540 --> 05:03:34,190
and
I eventually did get it to work

9796
05:03:34,190 --> 05:03:34,200
I eventually did get it to work
 

9797
05:03:34,200 --> 05:03:38,330
I eventually did get it to work
which I was so proud of and it was

9798
05:03:38,330 --> 05:03:38,340
which I was so proud of and it was
 

9799
05:03:38,340 --> 05:03:41,110
which I was so proud of and it was
quite frustrating I must say

9800
05:03:41,110 --> 05:03:41,120
quite frustrating I must say
 

9801
05:03:41,120 --> 05:03:45,770
quite frustrating I must say
uh the 3D suit for home 3D

9802
05:03:45,770 --> 05:03:45,780
uh the 3D suit for home 3D
 

9803
05:03:45,780 --> 05:03:49,430
uh the 3D suit for home 3D
it's what I'm talking about

9804
05:03:49,430 --> 05:03:49,440

 

9805
05:03:49,440 --> 05:03:52,670

um and then I tested it a little bit and

9806
05:03:52,670 --> 05:03:52,680
um and then I tested it a little bit and
 

9807
05:03:52,680 --> 05:03:55,128
um and then I tested it a little bit and
that's what that video was

9808
05:03:55,128 --> 05:03:55,138
that's what that video was
 

9809
05:03:55,138 --> 05:03:58,610
that's what that video was
and at that point of time

9810
05:03:58,610 --> 05:03:58,620
and at that point of time
 

9811
05:03:58,620 --> 05:04:02,150
and at that point of time
honestly dancing still looked very very

9812
05:04:02,150 --> 05:04:02,160
honestly dancing still looked very very
 

9813
05:04:02,160 --> 05:04:04,310
honestly dancing still looked very very
scuffed

9814
05:04:04,310 --> 05:04:04,320
scuffed
 

9815
05:04:04,320 --> 05:04:08,090
scuffed
but I thought it's so it's okay-ish like

9816
05:04:08,090 --> 05:04:08,100
but I thought it's so it's okay-ish like
 

9817
05:04:08,100 --> 05:04:11,510
but I thought it's so it's okay-ish like
I can't accept this amount of scum just

9818
05:04:11,510 --> 05:04:11,520
I can't accept this amount of scum just
 

9819
05:04:11,520 --> 05:04:16,310
I can't accept this amount of scum just
for the sake of it being in 3D

9820
05:04:16,310 --> 05:04:16,320

 

9821
05:04:16,320 --> 05:04:17,810

um so

9822
05:04:17,810 --> 05:04:17,820
um so
 

9823
05:04:17,820 --> 05:04:20,270
um so
I was like okay I'll record the whole

9824
05:04:20,270 --> 05:04:20,280
I was like okay I'll record the whole
 

9825
05:04:20,280 --> 05:04:22,788
I was like okay I'll record the whole
thing on the following day

9826
05:04:22,788 --> 05:04:22,798
thing on the following day
 

9827
05:04:22,798 --> 05:04:26,990
thing on the following day
properly like I wanted to so

9828
05:04:26,990 --> 05:04:27,000
properly like I wanted to so
 

9829
05:04:27,000 --> 05:04:30,050
properly like I wanted to so
I cook something I go to sleep I wake up

9830
05:04:30,050 --> 05:04:30,060
I cook something I go to sleep I wake up
 

9831
05:04:30,060 --> 05:04:32,270
I cook something I go to sleep I wake up
I just you know

9832
05:04:32,270 --> 05:04:32,280
I just you know
 

9833
05:04:32,280 --> 05:04:34,670
I just you know
do my things and then in the evening I

9834
05:04:34,670 --> 05:04:34,680
do my things and then in the evening I
 

9835
05:04:34,680 --> 05:04:36,470
do my things and then in the evening I
tried recording it

9836
05:04:36,470 --> 05:04:36,480
tried recording it
 

9837
05:04:36,480 --> 05:04:38,448
tried recording it
so I set up everything again and then I

9838
05:04:38,448 --> 05:04:38,458
so I set up everything again and then I
 

9839
05:04:38,458 --> 05:04:40,128
so I set up everything again and then I
ran into some troubles again for some

9840
05:04:40,128 --> 05:04:40,138
ran into some troubles again for some
 

9841
05:04:40,138 --> 05:04:42,230
ran into some troubles again for some
reason suddenly things just were not

9842
05:04:42,230 --> 05:04:42,240
reason suddenly things just were not
 

9843
05:04:42,240 --> 05:04:44,570
reason suddenly things just were not
working as they were working the evening

9844
05:04:44,570 --> 05:04:44,580
working as they were working the evening
 

9845
05:04:44,580 --> 05:04:48,430
working as they were working the evening
before of course

9846
05:04:48,430 --> 05:04:48,440

 

9847
05:04:48,440 --> 05:04:51,770

like the software was not doing what it

9848
05:04:51,770 --> 05:04:51,780
like the software was not doing what it
 

9849
05:04:51,780 --> 05:04:53,390
like the software was not doing what it
was supposed to be doing even though I

9850
05:04:53,390 --> 05:04:53,400
was supposed to be doing even though I
 

9851
05:04:53,400 --> 05:04:56,470
was supposed to be doing even though I
was doing it the same way as last night

9852
05:04:56,470 --> 05:04:56,480
was doing it the same way as last night
 

9853
05:04:56,480 --> 05:04:59,448
was doing it the same way as last night
and then when I finally got it to work

9854
05:04:59,448 --> 05:04:59,458
and then when I finally got it to work
 

9855
05:04:59,458 --> 05:05:01,128
and then when I finally got it to work
somehow

9856
05:05:01,128 --> 05:05:01,138
somehow
 

9857
05:05:01,138 --> 05:05:04,550
somehow
by jumping through some hoops

9858
05:05:04,550 --> 05:05:04,560
by jumping through some hoops
 

9859
05:05:04,560 --> 05:05:05,150
by jumping through some hoops
um

9860
05:05:05,150 --> 05:05:05,160
um
 

9861
05:05:05,160 --> 05:05:08,050
um
the performance was

9862
05:05:08,050 --> 05:05:08,060
the performance was
 

9863
05:05:08,060 --> 05:05:11,030
the performance was
absolutely terrible

9864
05:05:11,030 --> 05:05:11,040
absolutely terrible
 

9865
05:05:11,040 --> 05:05:12,948
absolutely terrible
and after a while it was already so late

9866
05:05:12,948 --> 05:05:12,958
and after a while it was already so late
 

9867
05:05:12,958 --> 05:05:14,868
and after a while it was already so late
again that I had to kind of stop again

9868
05:05:14,868 --> 05:05:14,878
again that I had to kind of stop again
 

9869
05:05:14,878 --> 05:05:16,190
again that I had to kind of stop again
so

9870
05:05:16,190 --> 05:05:16,200
so
 

9871
05:05:16,200 --> 05:05:20,510
so
I was hoping that since I kind of was at

9872
05:05:20,510 --> 05:05:20,520
I was hoping that since I kind of was at
 

9873
05:05:20,520 --> 05:05:22,850
I was hoping that since I kind of was at
the end of my wits at that point

9874
05:05:22,850 --> 05:05:22,860
the end of my wits at that point
 

9875
05:05:22,860 --> 05:05:25,550
the end of my wits at that point
that on the next day things would just

9876
05:05:25,550 --> 05:05:25,560
that on the next day things would just
 

9877
05:05:25,560 --> 05:05:29,150
that on the next day things would just
work properly and on the following day

9878
05:05:29,150 --> 05:05:29,160
work properly and on the following day
 

9879
05:05:29,160 --> 05:05:31,970
work properly and on the following day
one problem kind of

9880
05:05:31,970 --> 05:05:31,980
one problem kind of
 

9881
05:05:31,980 --> 05:05:34,730
one problem kind of
one small problem kind of seems to have

9882
05:05:34,730 --> 05:05:34,740
one small problem kind of seems to have
 

9883
05:05:34,740 --> 05:05:36,948
one small problem kind of seems to have
solved itself but the other problems

9884
05:05:36,948 --> 05:05:36,958
solved itself but the other problems
 

9885
05:05:36,958 --> 05:05:38,628
solved itself but the other problems
were still very much existing and it

9886
05:05:38,628 --> 05:05:38,638
were still very much existing and it
 

9887
05:05:38,638 --> 05:05:40,070
were still very much existing and it
kind of seemed partially even worse

9888
05:05:40,070 --> 05:05:40,080
kind of seemed partially even worse
 

9889
05:05:40,080 --> 05:05:41,690
kind of seemed partially even worse
again

9890
05:05:41,690 --> 05:05:41,700
again
 

9891
05:05:41,700 --> 05:05:44,570
again
um and I tried a couple things but I

9892
05:05:44,570 --> 05:05:44,580
um and I tried a couple things but I
 

9893
05:05:44,580 --> 05:05:46,128
um and I tried a couple things but I
just could not figure out what the

9894
05:05:46,128 --> 05:05:46,138
just could not figure out what the
 

9895
05:05:46,138 --> 05:05:50,150
just could not figure out what the
[\h__\h] problem was because suddenly my

9896
05:05:50,150 --> 05:05:50,160
[\h__\h] problem was because suddenly my
 

9897
05:05:50,160 --> 05:05:54,250
[\h__\h] problem was because suddenly my
motion capture results where

9898
05:05:54,250 --> 05:05:54,260
motion capture results where
 

9899
05:05:54,260 --> 05:05:58,610
motion capture results where
like so insanely laggy

9900
05:05:58,610 --> 05:05:58,620
like so insanely laggy
 

9901
05:05:58,620 --> 05:06:02,270
like so insanely laggy
everything I was recording

9902
05:06:02,270 --> 05:06:02,280
everything I was recording
 

9903
05:06:02,280 --> 05:06:03,948
everything I was recording
was

9904
05:06:03,948 --> 05:06:03,958
was
 

9905
05:06:03,958 --> 05:06:09,650
was
with low FPS for some reason and with

9906
05:06:09,650 --> 05:06:09,660
with low FPS for some reason and with
 

9907
05:06:09,660 --> 05:06:10,788
with low FPS for some reason and with
um like

9908
05:06:10,788 --> 05:06:10,798
um like
 

9909
05:06:10,798 --> 05:06:15,288
um like
a bit delay a big delay like the moves

9910
05:06:15,288 --> 05:06:15,298
a bit delay a big delay like the moves
 

9911
05:06:15,298 --> 05:06:17,868
a bit delay a big delay like the moves
were like three two to three seconds

9912
05:06:17,868 --> 05:06:17,878
were like three two to three seconds
 

9913
05:06:17,878 --> 05:06:21,110
were like three two to three seconds
delayed and really like slow motiony

9914
05:06:21,110 --> 05:06:21,120
delayed and really like slow motiony
 

9915
05:06:21,120 --> 05:06:22,550
delayed and really like slow motiony
kind of

9916
05:06:22,550 --> 05:06:22,560
kind of
 

9917
05:06:22,560 --> 05:06:26,930
kind of
yeah really not in sync and I think

9918
05:06:26,930 --> 05:06:26,940
yeah really not in sync and I think
 

9919
05:06:26,940 --> 05:06:29,030
yeah really not in sync and I think
maybe

9920
05:06:29,030 --> 05:06:29,040
maybe
 

9921
05:06:29,040 --> 05:06:32,570
maybe
it could have in theory

9922
05:06:32,570 --> 05:06:32,580
it could have in theory
 

9923
05:06:32,580 --> 05:06:34,730
it could have in theory
it could be the internet but I don't

9924
05:06:34,730 --> 05:06:34,740
it could be the internet but I don't
 

9925
05:06:34,740 --> 05:06:36,770
it could be the internet but I don't
think so because I bought a dedicated

9926
05:06:36,770 --> 05:06:36,780
think so because I bought a dedicated
 

9927
05:06:36,780 --> 05:06:41,628
think so because I bought a dedicated
router and I bought uh anyway I actually

9928
05:06:41,628 --> 05:06:41,638
router and I bought uh anyway I actually
 

9929
05:06:41,638 --> 05:06:45,230
router and I bought uh anyway I actually
have very good internet I tested it

9930
05:06:45,230 --> 05:06:45,240
have very good internet I tested it
 

9931
05:06:45,240 --> 05:06:47,090
have very good internet I tested it
don't really think it was the internet

9932
05:06:47,090 --> 05:06:47,100
don't really think it was the internet
 

9933
05:06:47,100 --> 05:06:50,090
don't really think it was the internet
connection itself but maybe it could be

9934
05:06:50,090 --> 05:06:50,100
connection itself but maybe it could be
 

9935
05:06:50,100 --> 05:06:51,410
connection itself but maybe it could be
many things

9936
05:06:51,410 --> 05:06:51,420
many things
 

9937
05:06:51,420 --> 05:06:53,288
many things
but I just couldn't figure it out

9938
05:06:53,288 --> 05:06:53,298
but I just couldn't figure it out
 

9939
05:06:53,298 --> 05:06:56,330
but I just couldn't figure it out
somehow it just did not work like it did

9940
05:06:56,330 --> 05:06:56,340
somehow it just did not work like it did
 

9941
05:06:56,340 --> 05:06:58,850
somehow it just did not work like it did
in the first night

9942
05:06:58,850 --> 05:06:58,860
in the first night
 

9943
05:06:58,860 --> 05:07:02,510
in the first night
and I got really sad and upset and I ran

9944
05:07:02,510 --> 05:07:02,520
and I got really sad and upset and I ran
 

9945
05:07:02,520 --> 05:07:05,510
and I got really sad and upset and I ran
out of time so I gave up

9946
05:07:05,510 --> 05:07:05,520
out of time so I gave up
 

9947
05:07:05,520 --> 05:07:08,448
out of time so I gave up
and whatever I had to record I just

9948
05:07:08,448 --> 05:07:08,458
and whatever I had to record I just
 

9949
05:07:08,458 --> 05:07:11,628
and whatever I had to record I just
ended up recording it in 2D

9950
05:07:11,628 --> 05:07:11,638
ended up recording it in 2D
 

9951
05:07:11,638 --> 05:07:14,990
ended up recording it in 2D
so I kind of wasted two full days

9952
05:07:14,990 --> 05:07:15,000
so I kind of wasted two full days
 

9953
05:07:15,000 --> 05:07:19,070
so I kind of wasted two full days
on trying to fix something

9954
05:07:19,070 --> 05:07:19,080
on trying to fix something
 

9955
05:07:19,080 --> 05:07:20,350
on trying to fix something
yeah

9956
05:07:20,350 --> 05:07:20,360
yeah
 

9957
05:07:20,360 --> 05:07:22,910
yeah
and that was kind of hope

9958
05:07:22,910 --> 05:07:22,920
and that was kind of hope
 

9959
05:07:22,920 --> 05:07:25,368
and that was kind of hope
is a suit for some cool things and the

9960
05:07:25,368 --> 05:07:25,378
is a suit for some cool things and the
 

9961
05:07:25,378 --> 05:07:27,110
is a suit for some cool things and the
only thing I really ended up using it

9962
05:07:27,110 --> 05:07:27,120
only thing I really ended up using it
 

9963
05:07:27,120 --> 05:07:29,510
only thing I really ended up using it
for was since I was already wearing it I

9964
05:07:29,510 --> 05:07:29,520
for was since I was already wearing it I
 

9965
05:07:29,520 --> 05:07:31,070
for was since I was already wearing it I
was like okay you know what I could at

9966
05:07:31,070 --> 05:07:31,080
was like okay you know what I could at
 

9967
05:07:31,080 --> 05:07:32,390
was like okay you know what I could at
least take some

9968
05:07:32,390 --> 05:07:32,400
least take some
 

9969
05:07:32,400 --> 05:07:35,510
least take some
screenshots for thumbtails so I took a

9970
05:07:35,510 --> 05:07:35,520
screenshots for thumbtails so I took a
 

9971
05:07:35,520 --> 05:07:38,270
screenshots for thumbtails so I took a
video where I in very slow motion and

9972
05:07:38,270 --> 05:07:38,280
video where I in very slow motion and
 

9973
05:07:38,280 --> 05:07:40,570
video where I in very slow motion and
with lots of delay just did a lot of

9974
05:07:40,570 --> 05:07:40,580
with lots of delay just did a lot of
 

9975
05:07:40,580 --> 05:07:44,510
with lots of delay just did a lot of
poses cute poses for thumbnails in the

9976
05:07:44,510 --> 05:07:44,520

anyway so um we kind of figured it out

10186
05:12:50,930 --> 05:12:50,940
anyway so um we kind of figured it out
 

10187
05:12:50,940 --> 05:12:53,090
anyway so um we kind of figured it out
we just have to do it in practice not in

05:12:53,090 --> 05:12:53,100
we just have to do it in practice not in
 

10189
05:12:53,100 --> 05:12:54,430
we just have to do it in practice not in

10190
05:12:54,430 --> 05:12:54,440
theory
 

10191
05:12:54,440 --> 05:12:58,070

also also also in theory in theory I

10192
05:12:58,070 --> 05:12:58,080
also also also in theory in theory I
 

10193
05:12:58,080 --> 05:13:01,010
also also also in theory in theory I
need to know it to

10194
05:13:01,010 --> 05:13:01,020

then it would be Japan
 

10281
05:15:19,138 --> 05:15:21,350

at that point was the fact that this one

would need a the jump pad and then I go

06:55:30,478 --> 06:55:32,610
would need a the jump pad and then I go
up and then I make the bridge right

06:56:44,208 --> 06:56:44,218
so
 

13731
06:56:44,218 --> 06:56:49,120
so
then I would make this bridge but

13732
06:56:49,120 --> 06:56:49,130
then I would make this bridge but
 

13733
06:56:49,130 --> 06:56:54,770
then I would make this bridge but

13735
06:56:54,780 --> 06:56:56,930

maybe if I

13736
06:56:56,930 --> 06:56:56,940
maybe if I
 

13737
06:56:56,940 --> 06:57:01,010
maybe if I
ah if I have the

13738
06:57:01,010 --> 06:57:01,020
ah if I have the
 

13739
06:57:01,020 --> 06:57:05,150
ah if I have the
jump pad starting right here and then

13740
06:57:05,150 --> 06:57:05,160
jump pad starting right here and then
 

13741
06:57:05,160 --> 06:57:08,270
jump pad starting right here and then
I'm I'm here so I reverse it back

13742
06:57:08,270 --> 06:57:08,280
I'm I'm here so I reverse it back
 

13743
06:57:08,280 --> 06:57:10,368
I'm I'm here so I reverse it back
to this state

13744
06:57:10,368 --> 06:57:10,378
to this state
 

13745
06:57:10,378 --> 06:57:11,410
to this state
and then

13746
06:57:11,410 --> 06:57:11,420
and then
 

13747
06:57:11,420 --> 06:57:14,810
and then
I reverse this to be here okay yeah

13748
06:57:14,810 --> 06:57:14,820
I reverse this to be here okay yeah
 

13749
06:57:14,820 --> 06:57:19,730
I reverse this to be here okay yeah
that's simple Infinity

13750
06:57:19,730 --> 06:57:19,740

 

13751
06:57:19,740 --> 06:57:22,490

yeah we just have to plan it out nicely

13752
06:57:22,490 --> 06:57:22,500
yeah we just have to plan it out nicely
 

13753
06:57:22,500 --> 06:57:24,910
yeah we just have to plan it out nicely
and save some time

13754
06:57:24,910 --> 06:57:24,920
and save some time
 

13755
06:57:24,920 --> 06:57:29,288
and save some time
so okay

13756
06:57:29,288 --> 06:57:29,298

 

13757
06:57:29,298 --> 06:57:33,288

oh yeah

13758
06:57:33,288 --> 06:57:33,298

 

13759
06:57:33,298 --> 06:57:37,368

41 seconds on it did we get more time on

13760
06:57:37,368 --> 06:57:37,378
41 seconds on it did we get more time on
 

13761
06:57:37,378 --> 06:57:39,830
41 seconds on it did we get more time on
this again actually this one seems to be

13762
06:57:39,830 --> 06:57:39,840
this again actually this one seems to be
 

13763
06:57:39,840 --> 06:57:42,230
this again actually this one seems to be
good to go in theory but we have to fix

13764
06:57:42,230 --> 06:57:42,240
good to go in theory but we have to fix
 

13765
06:57:42,240 --> 06:57:44,090
good to go in theory but we have to fix
this one because this one will not go

13766
06:57:44,090 --> 06:57:44,100
this one because this one will not go
 

13767
06:57:44,100 --> 06:57:45,708
this one because this one will not go
back all the way

13768
06:57:45,708 --> 06:57:45,718
back all the way
 

13769
06:57:45,718 --> 06:57:50,330

13773
06:57:54,298 --> 06:58:02,510

more than 49 seconds yeah

13774
06:58:02,510 --> 06:58:02,520

 

13775
06:58:02,520 --> 06:58:04,490

we got upgraded I don't know when and

13776
06:58:04,490 --> 06:58:04,500
we got upgraded I don't know when and
 

13777
06:58:04,500 --> 06:58:05,930
we got upgraded I don't know when and
why but

13778
06:58:05,930 --> 06:58:05,940
why but
 

13779
06:58:05,940 --> 06:58:10,128
why but
no complaining here

13780
06:58:10,128 --> 06:58:10,138

 

13781
06:58:10,138 --> 06:58:15,230

so that is your last placement

13782
06:58:15,230 --> 06:58:15,240

 

13783
06:58:15,240 --> 06:58:17,208

13785
06:58:17,218 --> 06:58:19,968
and
you would go here last okay

13786
06:58:19,968 --> 06:58:19,978
you would go here last okay
 

13787
06:58:19,978 --> 06:58:22,150

13815
06:59:12,840 --> 06:59:15,288

no better

14680
07:25:22,610 --> 07:25:22,620
no better
 

14681
07:25:22,620 --> 07:25:24,708
no better
but maybe it was because it was a bus

14682
07:25:24,708 --> 07:25:24,718
but maybe it was because it was a bus
 

14683
07:25:24,718 --> 07:25:27,770
but maybe it was because it was a bus
that was like a little bit like

14684
07:25:27,770 --> 07:25:27,780
that was like a little bit like
 

14685
07:25:27,780 --> 07:25:29,690
that was like a little bit like
I wouldn't say on the edge of the city

I wouldn't say on the edge of the city
 

14687
07:25:29,700 --> 07:25:32,810
I wouldn't say on the edge of the city
not at all but it was I guess not a

14688
07:25:32,810 --> 07:25:32,820
not at all but it was I guess not a
 

14689
07:25:32,820 --> 07:25:35,500
not at all but it was I guess not a
really busy area

14690
07:25:35,500 --> 07:25:35,510
really busy area
 

14691
07:25:35,510 --> 07:25:39,770
really busy area

14693
07:25:39,780 --> 07:25:42,530

London buses can be rough it was even

14694
07:25:42,530 --> 07:25:42,540
London buses can be rough it was even
 

14695
07:25:42,540 --> 07:25:44,150
London buses can be rough it was even
though you know I thought I was safe

14696
07:25:44,150 --> 07:25:44,160
though you know I thought I was safe
 

14697
07:25:44,160 --> 07:25:46,010
though you know I thought I was safe
because they speak English there I speak

14698
07:25:46,010 --> 07:25:46,020
because they speak English there I speak
 

14699
07:25:46,020 --> 07:25:48,288
because they speak English there I speak
fluent English can't be so bad right but

14700
07:25:48,288 --> 07:25:48,298
fluent English can't be so bad right but
 

14701
07:25:48,298 --> 07:25:56,628
fluent English can't be so bad right but
no I felt pretty lost in London

14702
07:25:56,628 --> 07:25:56,638

 

14703
07:25:56,638 --> 07:25:58,310

um no they just really did not stop

14704
07:25:58,310 --> 07:25:58,320
um no they just really did not stop
 

14705
07:25:58,320 --> 07:25:59,390
um no they just really did not stop
because

14706
07:25:59,390 --> 07:25:59,400
because
 

14707
07:25:59,400 --> 07:26:01,190
because
um I did not put out my hand that was

14708
07:26:01,190 --> 07:26:01,200
um I did not put out my hand that was
 

14709
07:26:01,200 --> 07:26:05,930
um I did not put out my hand that was
literally the whole reason

14710
07:26:05,930 --> 07:26:05,940

 

14711
07:26:05,940 --> 07:26:11,448

okay so I'm assuming

14712
07:26:11,448 --> 07:26:11,458

 

14713
07:26:11,458 --> 07:26:16,430

this is maybe hopefully all that the

14714
07:26:16,430 --> 07:26:16,440
this is maybe hopefully all that the
 

14715
07:26:16,440 --> 07:26:19,548
this is maybe hopefully all that the
jump pad has to do

14716
07:26:19,548 --> 07:26:19,558
jump pad has to do
 

14717
07:26:19,558 --> 07:26:23,390
jump pad has to do

and but I do need them no I don't need a
 

14719
07:26:23,400 --> 07:26:25,968

14722
07:26:28,910 --> 07:26:28,920
ah but wait this one cannot be rewinded
 

14723
07:26:28,920 --> 07:26:33,110
ah but wait this one cannot be rewinded
so there must be another

14724
07:26:33,110 --> 07:26:33,120

 

14725
07:26:33,120 --> 07:26:35,750

huh

14726
07:26:35,750 --> 07:26:35,760

 

14727
07:26:35,760 --> 07:26:38,570

no never mind that one is not necessary

14728
07:26:38,570 --> 07:26:38,580

to Open Door
 

14731
07:26:41,340 --> 07:26:43,490
to Open Door
so they don't have to be pressed at the

14732
07:26:43,490 --> 07:26:43,500
so they don't have to be pressed at the
 

14733
07:26:43,500 --> 07:26:45,110
so they don't have to be pressed at the
same time at the end I thought that was

07:26:45,110 --> 07:26:45,120
same time at the end I thought that was
 

14735
07:26:45,120 --> 07:26:47,690

07:27:22,200 --> 07:27:26,208
the bus was just not supposed to stop
there for some reason

14762
07:27:26,208 --> 07:27:26,218

 

14763
07:27:26,218 --> 07:27:28,610

wait let me redo

14764
07:27:28,610 --> 07:27:28,620
wait let me redo
 

14765
07:27:28,620 --> 07:27:31,368
wait let me redo
wait no there is another thing over

14766
07:27:31,368 --> 07:27:31,378
wait no there is another thing over
 

14767
07:27:31,378 --> 07:27:35,448
wait no there is another thing over
there that's necessary to open the door

14768
07:27:35,448 --> 07:27:35,458

 

14769
07:27:35,458 --> 07:27:41,390

so we will never know

14770
07:27:41,390 --> 07:27:41,400

 

14771
07:27:41,400 --> 07:27:48,048

just testing out some options here

14772
07:27:48,048 --> 07:27:48,058

 

14773
07:27:48,058 --> 07:27:51,590

there's no way that this one Cube has to

14774
07:27:51,590 --> 07:27:51,600
there's no way that this one Cube has to
 

14775
07:27:51,600 --> 07:27:54,288
there's no way that this one Cube has to
go to so many places

14776
07:27:54,288 --> 07:27:54,298
go to so many places
 

14777
07:27:54,298 --> 07:27:56,930
go to so many places
there is no way we're probably gonna get

14778
07:27:56,930 --> 07:27:56,940
there is no way we're probably gonna get
 

14779
07:27:56,940 --> 07:28:00,548
there is no way we're probably gonna get
another Cube behind that

14780
07:28:00,548 --> 07:28:00,558

 

14781
07:28:00,558 --> 07:28:10,560

I don't believe that I don't buy it

14782
07:28:10,560 --> 07:28:10,570

 

14783
07:28:10,570 --> 07:28:16,910

[Music]

14784
07:28:16,910 --> 07:28:16,920

 

14785
07:28:16,920 --> 07:28:22,548

oh wait

14786
07:28:22,548 --> 07:28:22,558

 

14787
07:28:22,558 --> 07:28:24,590

Korean buses just stop when people are

14788
07:28:24,590 --> 07:28:24,600
Korean buses just stop when people are
 

14789
07:28:24,600 --> 07:28:26,750
Korean buses just stop when people are
standing yeah I think that's like normal

14790
07:28:26,750 --> 07:28:26,760
standing yeah I think that's like normal
 

14791
07:28:26,760 --> 07:28:28,670
standing yeah I think that's like normal
in most places when there's no people at

14792
07:28:28,670 --> 07:28:28,680
in most places when there's no people at
 

14793
07:28:28,680 --> 07:28:30,288
in most places when there's no people at
the bus station and no one wants to get

14794
07:28:30,288 --> 07:28:30,298
the bus station and no one wants to get
 

14795
07:28:30,298 --> 07:28:32,750
the bus station and no one wants to get
out either then they just don't stop but

14796
07:28:32,750 --> 07:28:32,760
out either then they just don't stop but
 

14797
07:28:32,760 --> 07:28:34,430
out either then they just don't stop but
if there's someone waiting at the bus

14798
07:28:34,430 --> 07:28:34,440
if there's someone waiting at the bus
 

14799
07:28:34,440 --> 07:28:35,208
if there's someone waiting at the bus
stop

14800
07:28:35,208 --> 07:28:35,218
stop
 

14801
07:28:35,218 --> 07:28:38,890
stop
normally see there's another one oh

14802
07:28:38,890 --> 07:28:38,900
normally see there's another one oh
 

14803
07:28:38,900 --> 07:28:40,610
normally see there's another one oh
normally

14804
07:28:40,610 --> 07:28:40,620
normally
 

14805
07:28:40,620 --> 07:28:42,468
normally
it will just stop when they see someone

14806
07:28:42,468 --> 07:28:42,478
it will just stop when they see someone
 

14807
07:28:42,478 --> 07:28:43,548
it will just stop when they see someone
waiting

14808
07:28:43,548 --> 07:28:43,558
waiting
 

14809
07:28:43,558 --> 07:28:45,948
waiting
like I understand if a bus doesn't stop

14810
07:28:45,948 --> 07:28:45,958
like I understand if a bus doesn't stop
 

14811
07:28:45,958 --> 07:28:47,628
like I understand if a bus doesn't stop
even though there is a person there

14812
07:28:47,628 --> 07:28:47,638
even though there is a person there
 

14813
07:28:47,638 --> 07:28:50,930
even though there is a person there
waiting because the person doesn't look

14814
07:28:50,930 --> 07:28:50,940
waiting because the person doesn't look
 

14815
07:28:50,940 --> 07:28:53,270
waiting because the person doesn't look
like they want to enter the bus because

14816
07:28:53,270 --> 07:28:53,280
like they want to enter the bus because
 

14817
07:28:53,280 --> 07:28:55,610
like they want to enter the bus because
there's different buses that go by the

14818
07:28:55,610 --> 07:28:55,620
there's different buses that go by the
 

14819
07:28:55,620 --> 07:28:57,288
there's different buses that go by the
bus station so

14820
07:28:57,288 --> 07:28:57,298
bus station so
 

14821
07:28:57,298 --> 07:29:00,350
bus station so
the person will maybe just like

14822
07:29:00,350 --> 07:29:00,360
the person will maybe just like
 

14823
07:29:00,360 --> 07:29:02,930
the person will maybe just like
keep on sitting and look interested not

14824
07:29:02,930 --> 07:29:02,940
keep on sitting and look interested not
 

14825
07:29:02,940 --> 07:29:05,868
keep on sitting and look interested not
interested enough into the to enter the

14826
07:29:05,868 --> 07:29:05,878
interested enough into the to enter the
 

14827
07:29:05,878 --> 07:29:07,730
interested enough into the to enter the
bus like that makes sense if the bus

14828
07:29:07,730 --> 07:29:07,740
bus like that makes sense if the bus
 

14829
07:29:07,740 --> 07:29:09,948
bus like that makes sense if the bus
passes then I get that I've had that

14830
07:29:09,948 --> 07:29:09,958
passes then I get that I've had that
 

14831
07:29:09,958 --> 07:29:12,468
passes then I get that I've had that
before I appreciate it sometimes I just

14832
07:29:12,468 --> 07:29:12,478
before I appreciate it sometimes I just
 

14833
07:29:12,478 --> 07:29:15,468
before I appreciate it sometimes I just
felt like awkward when a bus would stop

14834
07:29:15,468 --> 07:29:15,478
felt like awkward when a bus would stop
 

14835
07:29:15,478 --> 07:29:18,530
felt like awkward when a bus would stop
for me no one gets in no one gets out

14836
07:29:18,530 --> 07:29:18,540
for me no one gets in no one gets out
 

14837
07:29:18,540 --> 07:29:20,990
for me no one gets in no one gets out
it's literally just me and then I'm like

14838
07:29:20,990 --> 07:29:21,000
it's literally just me and then I'm like
 

14839
07:29:21,000 --> 07:29:24,830
it's literally just me and then I'm like
oh sorry I I did not I did not intend on

14840
07:29:24,830 --> 07:29:24,840
oh sorry I I did not I did not intend on
 

14841
07:29:24,840 --> 07:29:28,788
oh sorry I I did not I did not intend on
getting into you I'm sorry

14842
07:29:28,788 --> 07:29:28,798
getting into you I'm sorry
 

14843
07:29:28,798 --> 07:29:31,190
getting into you I'm sorry
so I prefer

14844
07:29:31,190 --> 07:29:31,200
so I prefer
 

14845
07:29:31,200 --> 07:29:35,750
so I prefer
if they just drive by

14846
07:29:35,750 --> 07:29:35,760

 

14847
07:29:35,760 --> 07:29:36,948

oh

14848
07:29:36,948 --> 07:29:36,958
oh
 

14849
07:29:36,958 --> 07:29:42,110
oh
it's a bit awkward

14850
07:29:42,110 --> 07:29:42,120

 

14851
07:29:42,120 --> 07:29:45,350

sorry for wasting your time I guess

14852
07:29:45,350 --> 07:29:45,360
sorry for wasting your time I guess
 

14853
07:29:45,360 --> 07:29:49,310
sorry for wasting your time I guess
Okay so we've done this so now we can

14854
07:29:49,310 --> 07:29:49,320
Okay so we've done this so now we can
 

14855
07:29:49,320 --> 07:29:51,410
Okay so we've done this so now we can
maybe start thinking

14856
07:29:51,410 --> 07:29:51,420
maybe start thinking
 

14857
07:29:51,420 --> 07:29:53,750
maybe start thinking
five steps ahead

14858
07:29:53,750 --> 07:29:53,760
five steps ahead
 

14859
07:29:53,760 --> 07:29:58,368
five steps ahead
like we wanted more

14860
07:29:58,368 --> 07:29:58,378

 

14861
07:29:58,378 --> 07:30:01,548

bus always stops at regular stops oh and

14862
07:30:01,548 --> 07:30:01,558
bus always stops at regular stops oh and
 

14863
07:30:01,558 --> 07:30:03,288
bus always stops at regular stops oh and
there's oh there's two different types

14864
07:30:03,288 --> 07:30:03,298
there's oh there's two different types
 

14865
07:30:03,298 --> 07:30:05,770
there's oh there's two different types
of bus stops

14866
07:30:05,770 --> 07:30:05,780
of bus stops
 

14867
07:30:05,780 --> 07:30:08,448
of bus stops
I can see at the on-demand ones are just

14868
07:30:08,448 --> 07:30:08,458
I can see at the on-demand ones are just
 

14869
07:30:08,458 --> 07:30:10,430
I can see at the on-demand ones are just
the ones that are less popular where

14870
07:30:10,430 --> 07:30:10,440
the ones that are less popular where
 

14871
07:30:10,440 --> 07:30:14,930
the ones that are less popular where
less people get up see that makes sense

14872
07:30:14,930 --> 07:30:14,940

 

14873
07:30:14,940 --> 07:30:18,170

convey a long jump wow

14874
07:30:18,170 --> 07:30:18,180
convey a long jump wow
 

14875
07:30:18,180 --> 07:30:21,350
convey a long jump wow
it's a bit weird here oh wait

14876
07:30:21,350 --> 07:30:21,360
it's a bit weird here oh wait
 

14877
07:30:21,360 --> 07:30:23,090
it's a bit weird here oh wait
that's why there's a blue one on top

14878
07:30:23,090 --> 07:30:23,100
that's why there's a blue one on top
 

14879
07:30:23,100 --> 07:30:25,070
that's why there's a blue one on top
they want me to place one of those on

14880
07:30:25,070 --> 07:30:25,080
they want me to place one of those on
 

14881
07:30:25,080 --> 07:30:30,170
they want me to place one of those on
top of that

14882
07:30:30,170 --> 07:30:30,180

 

14883
07:30:30,180 --> 07:30:32,990

oh this one is best

14884
07:30:32,990 --> 07:30:33,000
oh this one is best
 

14885
07:30:33,000 --> 07:30:34,690
oh this one is best
and never mind

14886
07:30:34,690 --> 07:30:34,700
and never mind
 

14887
07:30:34,700 --> 07:30:44,150
and never mind
uh that was actually connected after all

14888
07:30:44,150 --> 07:30:44,160

 

14889
07:30:44,160 --> 07:30:46,190

one

14890
07:30:46,190 --> 07:30:46,200
one
 

14891
07:30:46,200 --> 07:30:48,110
one
preferably actually this one but

14892
07:30:48,110 --> 07:30:48,120
preferably actually this one but
 

14893
07:30:48,120 --> 07:30:49,430
preferably actually this one but
whatever

14894
07:30:49,430 --> 07:30:49,440
whatever
 

14895
07:30:49,440 --> 07:30:52,788
whatever
goes here

14896
07:30:52,788 --> 07:30:52,798

 

14897
07:30:52,798 --> 07:30:55,490

and then there

14898
07:30:55,490 --> 07:30:55,500
and then there
 

14899
07:30:55,500 --> 07:30:58,368
and then there
and one

14900
07:30:58,368 --> 07:30:58,378
and one
 

14901
07:30:58,378 --> 07:31:02,208
and one
ah whatever at least uh one more step

14902
07:31:02,208 --> 07:31:02,218
ah whatever at least uh one more step
 

14903
07:31:02,218 --> 07:31:04,310
ah whatever at least uh one more step
because it needs to bring me up then I

14904
07:31:04,310 --> 07:31:04,320
because it needs to bring me up then I
 

14905
07:31:04,320 --> 07:31:05,810
because it needs to bring me up then I
go

14906
07:31:05,810 --> 07:31:05,820
go
 

14907
07:31:05,820 --> 07:31:10,250
go
there ah

14908
07:31:10,250 --> 07:31:10,260

 

14909
07:31:10,260 --> 07:31:12,530

wait let me think which which steps come

14910
07:31:12,530 --> 07:31:12,540
wait let me think which which steps come
 

14911
07:31:12,540 --> 07:31:14,330
wait let me think which which steps come
which Step comes first why does this one

14912
07:31:14,330 --> 07:31:14,340
which Step comes first why does this one
 

14913
07:31:14,340 --> 07:31:17,570
which Step comes first why does this one
have so much time on it

14914
07:31:17,570 --> 07:31:17,580

 

14915
07:31:17,580 --> 07:31:19,310

um this is where it needs to be last

14916
07:31:19,310 --> 07:31:19,320
um this is where it needs to be last
 

14917
07:31:19,320 --> 07:31:21,230
um this is where it needs to be last
this is where it needs to be second to

14918
07:31:21,230 --> 07:31:21,240
this is where it needs to be second to
 

14919
07:31:21,240 --> 07:31:22,430
this is where it needs to be second to
last

14920
07:31:22,430 --> 07:31:22,440
last
 

14921
07:31:22,440 --> 07:31:24,948
last
okay we're good we're good can I just

14922
07:31:24,948 --> 07:31:24,958
okay we're good we're good can I just
 

14923
07:31:24,958 --> 07:31:27,368
okay we're good we're good can I just
lift it up by

14924
07:31:27,368 --> 07:31:27,378
lift it up by
 

14925
07:31:27,378 --> 07:31:33,110
lift it up by
doing this okay

14926

07:41:25,788 --> 07:41:25,798
Freedom something you guys will never
 

15271
07:41:25,798 --> 07:41:32,448
Freedom something you guys will never
know what it's like

15272
07:41:32,448 --> 07:41:32,458

 

15273
07:41:32,458 --> 07:41:34,490

but you're you're happy with that right

15274
07:41:34,490 --> 07:41:34,500
but you're you're happy with that right
 

15275
07:41:34,500 --> 07:41:36,170
but you're you're happy with that right
you don't mind it

15276
07:41:36,170 --> 07:41:36,180
you don't mind it
 

15277
07:41:36,180 --> 07:41:39,948
you don't mind it
you don't what the [\h__\h]

15278
07:41:39,948 --> 07:41:39,958

 

15279
07:41:39,958 --> 07:41:42,048

the [\h__\h] bugged into that is glitched

15280
07:41:42,048 --> 07:41:42,058
the [\h__\h] bugged into that is glitched
 

15281
07:41:42,058 --> 07:41:44,570
the [\h__\h] bugged into that is glitched
into it I think

15282
07:41:44,570 --> 07:41:44,580
into it I think
 

15283
07:41:44,580 --> 07:41:48,650
into it I think
oh man

15284
07:41:48,650 --> 07:41:48,660

 

15285
07:41:48,660 --> 07:41:50,990

I wonder if that would kill me if I was

15286
07:41:50,990 --> 07:41:51,000
I wonder if that would kill me if I was
 

15287
07:41:51,000 --> 07:41:53,270
I wonder if that would kill me if I was
to stand underneath it when it's coming

15288
07:41:53,270 --> 07:41:53,280
to stand underneath it when it's coming
 

15289
07:41:53,280 --> 07:41:57,890
to stand underneath it when it's coming
down

15290
07:41:57,890 --> 07:41:57,900

 

15291
07:41:57,900 --> 07:42:00,850

I feel like it would

15292
07:42:00,850 --> 07:42:00,860

 

15293
07:42:00,860 --> 07:42:07,610

gosh now don't don't mess around now

15294
07:42:07,610 --> 07:42:07,620

 

15295
07:42:07,620 --> 07:42:09,530

I'll never be free of potential and I'm

15296
07:42:09,530 --> 07:42:09,540
I'll never be free of potential and I'm
 

15297
07:42:09,540 --> 07:42:12,830
I'll never be free of potential and I'm
happy freedom is overrated so true so

15298
07:42:12,830 --> 07:42:12,840
happy freedom is overrated so true so
 

15299
07:42:12,840 --> 07:42:19,610
happy freedom is overrated so true so
true I agree 100.

15300
07:42:19,610 --> 07:42:19,620

 

15301
07:42:19,620 --> 07:42:22,010

outside scaring dangerous yeah yeah be

15302
07:42:22,010 --> 07:42:22,020
outside scaring dangerous yeah yeah be
 

15303
07:42:22,020 --> 07:42:27,770

07:42:27,770 --> 07:42:27,780

 

15305
07:42:27,780 --> 07:42:29,948

okay

15306
07:42:29,948 --> 07:42:29,958
okay
 

15307
07:42:29,958 --> 07:42:32,948
okay
that's all democracy dies

15308
07:42:32,948 --> 07:42:32,958
that's all democracy dies
 

15309
07:42:32,958 --> 07:42:35,570
that's all democracy dies
well that is not like you guys had a

15310
07:42:35,570 --> 07:42:35,580
well that is not like you guys had a
 

15311
07:42:35,580 --> 07:42:36,948
well that is not like you guys had a
problem with it you might regret it

15312
07:42:36,948 --> 07:42:36,958
problem with it you might regret it
 

15313
07:42:36,958 --> 07:42:38,750
problem with it you might regret it
later on but um

15314
07:42:38,750 --> 07:42:38,760
later on but um
 

15315
07:42:38,760 --> 07:42:40,548
later on but um
for now

15316
07:42:40,548 --> 07:42:40,558
for now
 

15317
07:42:40,558 --> 07:42:42,770
for now
seems like we all have no problem with

15318
07:42:42,770 --> 07:42:42,780
seems like we all have no problem with
 

15319
07:42:42,780 --> 07:42:44,690
seems like we all have no problem with
that

15320
07:42:44,690 --> 07:42:44,700
that
 

15321
07:42:44,700 --> 07:42:47,270
that
so where's the the bridge Cube that I

15322
07:42:47,270 --> 07:42:47,280
so where's the the bridge Cube that I
 

15323
07:42:47,280 --> 07:42:50,810
so where's the the bridge Cube that I
have been anticipating

15324
07:42:50,810 --> 07:42:50,820

 

15325
07:42:50,820 --> 07:42:52,090

weird

15326
07:42:52,090 --> 07:42:52,100
weird
 

15327
07:42:52,100 --> 07:42:55,730
weird
something's missing

15328
07:42:55,730 --> 07:42:55,740
something's missing
 

15329
07:42:55,740 --> 07:42:57,830
something's missing
I know I guess I'll just lift myself up

15330
07:42:57,830 --> 07:42:57,840
I know I guess I'll just lift myself up
 

15331
07:42:57,840 --> 07:43:04,010
I know I guess I'll just lift myself up
with this boy

15332
07:43:04,010 --> 07:43:04,020

 

15333
07:43:04,020 --> 07:43:06,530

you just have to

15334
07:43:06,530 --> 07:43:06,540
you just have to
 

15335
07:43:06,540 --> 07:43:08,690
you just have to
uh

15336
07:43:08,690 --> 07:43:08,700
uh
 

15337
07:43:08,700 --> 07:43:12,788
uh
figure out a way

15338
07:43:12,788 --> 07:43:12,798

 

15339
07:43:12,798 --> 07:43:16,968

ah I think I need this one first to help

15340
07:43:16,968 --> 07:43:16,978
ah I think I need this one first to help
 

15341
07:43:16,978 --> 07:43:19,368
ah I think I need this one first to help
me put this one in place

15342
07:43:19,368 --> 07:43:19,378
me put this one in place
 

15343
07:43:19,378 --> 07:43:24,410
me put this one in place
uh you'll see what I mean

15344
07:43:24,410 --> 07:43:24,420

 

15345
07:43:24,420 --> 07:43:26,690

no no I need the box to lift me up as

15346
07:43:26,690 --> 07:43:26,700
no no I need the box to lift me up as
 

15347
07:43:26,700 --> 07:43:29,990
no no I need the box to lift me up as
long as there is no uh Bridge Cube then

15348
07:43:29,990 --> 07:43:30,000
long as there is no uh Bridge Cube then
 

15349
07:43:30,000 --> 07:43:33,288
long as there is no uh Bridge Cube then
this is how we're doing it

15350
07:43:33,288 --> 07:43:33,298
this is how we're doing it
 

15351
07:43:33,298 --> 07:43:36,708
this is how we're doing it
I think I'm doing it correctly I think

15352
07:43:36,708 --> 07:43:36,718
I think I'm doing it correctly I think
 

15353
07:43:36,718 --> 07:43:40,968
I think I'm doing it correctly I think
trust me because perhaps

15354
07:43:40,968 --> 07:43:40,978
trust me because perhaps
 

15355
07:43:40,978 --> 07:43:44,390
trust me because perhaps
it has to be here no

15356
07:43:44,390 --> 07:43:44,400
it has to be here no
 

15357
07:43:44,400 --> 07:43:47,448
it has to be here no
hmm

15358
07:43:47,448 --> 07:43:47,458

 

15359
07:43:47,458 --> 07:43:56,890

such a weird way to place this Cube

15360
07:43:56,890 --> 07:43:56,900

 

15361
07:43:56,900 --> 07:44:01,250

that was probably too difficult

15362
07:44:01,250 --> 07:44:01,260

 

15363
07:44:01,260 --> 07:44:03,170

it's more like

15364
07:44:03,170 --> 07:44:03,180
it's more like
 

15365
07:44:03,180 --> 07:44:09,230
it's more like
oh what

15366
07:44:09,230 --> 07:44:09,240

 

15367
07:44:09,240 --> 07:44:11,390

weird placement

15368
07:44:11,390 --> 07:44:11,400
weird placement
 

15369
07:44:11,400 --> 07:44:15,590
weird placement
but okay yeah yeah so

15370
07:44:15,590 --> 07:44:15,600

 

15371
07:44:15,600 --> 07:44:18,170

um that's what I wanted

15372
07:44:18,170 --> 07:44:18,180
um that's what I wanted
 

15373
07:44:18,180 --> 07:44:20,868
um that's what I wanted
and then

15374
07:44:20,868 --> 07:44:20,878
and then
 

15375
07:44:20,878 --> 07:44:23,150
and then
ah

15376
07:44:23,150 --> 07:44:23,160
ah
 

15377
07:44:23,160 --> 07:44:25,850
ah
we don't need that door to be open

15378
07:44:25,850 --> 07:44:25,860
we don't need that door to be open
 

15379
07:44:25,860 --> 07:44:35,330
we don't need that door to be open
anymore so

15380
07:44:35,330 --> 07:44:35,340

 

15381
07:44:35,340 --> 07:44:38,270

big thank you

15382
07:44:38,270 --> 07:44:38,280
big thank you
 

15383
07:44:38,280 --> 07:44:40,650
big thank you
you see free possible solution

15384
07:44:40,650 --> 07:44:40,660
you see free possible solution
 

15385

auditioning for an akb48 group saying
that I don't like them

15786
07:54:52,368 --> 07:54:52,378
that I don't like them
 

15787
07:54:52,378 --> 07:54:55,868
that I don't like them
and you know I applied the lyric and the

07:55:00,350 --> 07:55:00,360
logic that that this will
 

15791
07:55:00,360 --> 07:55:02,208
logic that that this will
help

15792
07:55:02,208 --> 07:55:02,218
help
 

15793
07:55:02,218 --> 07:55:05,868
help
improve the group because I don't like

15794
07:55:05,868 --> 07:55:05,878
improve the group because I don't like
 

15795
07:55:05,878 --> 07:55:09,170
improve the group because I don't like
them so I will only be able to improve

15796
07:55:09,170 --> 07:55:09,180
them so I will only be able to improve
 

15797
07:55:09,180 --> 07:55:10,990
them so I will only be able to improve
them

15798
07:55:10,990 --> 07:55:11,000

my bird is the same logic that they use

15802
07:55:18,530 --> 07:55:18,540
my bird is the same logic that they use
 

15803
07:55:18,540 --> 07:55:21,590
my bird is the same logic that they use
for using directors like that or it was

15804
07:55:21,590 --> 07:55:21,600
for using directors like that or it was
 

15805
07:55:21,600 --> 07:55:24,110
for using directors like that or it was
just a matter of cost and fame or

15806
07:55:24,110 --> 07:55:24,120
just a matter of cost and fame or
 

15807
07:55:24,120 --> 07:55:26,270
just a matter of cost and fame or
whatever who does

07:55:26,270 --> 07:55:26,280
whatever who does
 

15809
07:55:26,280 --> 07:55:33,230
whatever who does
hmm

15810
07:55:33,230 --> 07:55:33,240

 

15811
07:55:33,240 --> 07:55:36,288

because I do think that it gives you a

15812
07:55:36,288 --> 07:55:36,298
because I do think that it gives you a
 

15813
07:55:36,298 --> 07:55:39,530
because I do think that it gives you a
different perspective not liking

15814
07:55:39,530 --> 07:55:39,540
different perspective not liking
 

15815
07:55:39,540 --> 07:55:40,850
different perspective not liking
something

15816
07:55:40,850 --> 07:55:40,860
something
 

15817
07:55:40,860 --> 07:55:45,590
something
but like really [\h__\h] hating it

15818
07:55:45,590 --> 07:55:45,600
but like really [\h__\h] hating it
 

15819
07:55:45,600 --> 07:55:47,448
but like really [\h__\h] hating it
is definitely dangerous to like

15820
07:55:47,448 --> 07:55:47,458
is definitely dangerous to like
 

15821
07:55:47,458 --> 07:55:48,850
is definitely dangerous to like
completely

15822
07:55:48,850 --> 07:55:48,860
completely
 

15823
07:55:48,860 --> 07:55:52,070
completely
destroy the original

15824
07:55:52,070 --> 07:55:52,080
destroy the original
 

15825
07:55:52,080 --> 07:55:54,110
destroy the original
charm that it had even if you admit that

15826
07:55:54,110 --> 07:55:54,120
charm that it had even if you admit that
 

15827
07:55:54,120 --> 07:55:56,208
charm that it had even if you admit that
there were things wrong with whatever

15828
07:55:56,208 --> 07:55:56,218
there were things wrong with whatever
 

15829
07:55:56,218 --> 07:55:59,570
there were things wrong with whatever
we're talking about

15830
07:55:59,570 --> 07:55:59,580

 

15831
07:55:59,580 --> 07:56:02,690

that is probably not the solution yet

15832
07:56:02,690 --> 07:56:02,700
that is probably not the solution yet
 

15833
07:56:02,700 --> 07:56:05,510
that is probably not the solution yet
and if anything it should be one

15834
07:56:05,510 --> 07:56:05,520
and if anything it should be one
 

15835
07:56:05,520 --> 07:56:07,910
and if anything it should be one
director who loves it and one director

15836
07:56:07,910 --> 07:56:07,920
director who loves it and one director
 

15837
07:56:07,920 --> 07:56:10,448
director who loves it and one director
who doesn't like it working together

15838
07:56:10,448 --> 07:56:10,458
who doesn't like it working together
 

15839
07:56:10,458 --> 07:56:13,610
who doesn't like it working together
making compromises

15840
07:56:13,610 --> 07:56:13,620
making compromises
 

15841
07:56:13,620 --> 07:56:14,750
making compromises
um

15842
07:56:14,750 --> 07:56:14,760
um
 

15843
07:56:14,760 --> 07:56:16,670
um
maybe that could work

15844
07:56:16,670 --> 07:56:16,680
maybe that could work
 

15845
07:56:16,680 --> 07:56:19,430
maybe that could work
but ideally it would be just someone who

15846
07:56:19,430 --> 07:56:19,440
but ideally it would be just someone who
 

15847
07:56:19,440 --> 07:56:21,288
but ideally it would be just someone who
loves it because if it's already popular

15848
07:56:21,288 --> 07:56:21,298
loves it because if it's already popular
 

15849
07:56:21,298 --> 07:56:23,990
loves it because if it's already popular
and is popular for a reason

15850
07:56:23,990 --> 07:56:24,000
and is popular for a reason
 

15851
07:56:24,000 --> 07:56:26,930
and is popular for a reason
and then there's no big needs to change

15852
07:56:26,930 --> 07:56:26,940
and then there's no big needs to change
 

15853
07:56:26,940 --> 07:56:30,770
and then there's no big needs to change
it up so much anyway let's read

15854
07:56:30,770 --> 07:56:30,780

 

15855
07:56:30,780 --> 07:56:31,670

um

15856
07:56:31,670 --> 07:56:31,680
um
 

15857
07:56:31,680 --> 07:56:37,548
um
where was I I'm probably there

15858
07:56:37,548 --> 07:56:37,558

 

15859
07:56:37,558 --> 07:56:40,070

it is now at the point where we can't

15860
07:56:40,070 --> 07:56:40,080
it is now at the point where we can't
 

15861
07:56:40,080 --> 07:56:41,930
it is now at the point where we can't
generate enough entropy energy quickly

15862
07:56:41,930 --> 07:56:41,940
generate enough entropy energy quickly
 

15863
07:56:41,940 --> 07:56:43,850
generate enough entropy energy quickly
enough to repair our own defenses well

15864
07:56:43,850 --> 07:56:43,860
enough to repair our own defenses well
 

15865
07:56:43,860 --> 07:56:46,010
enough to repair our own defenses well
especially not if I'm all alone here

15866
07:56:46,010 --> 07:56:46,020
especially not if I'm all alone here
 

15867
07:56:46,020 --> 07:56:48,170
especially not if I'm all alone here
which is why we are declaring a threat

15868
07:56:48,170 --> 07:56:48,180
which is why we are declaring a threat
 

15869
07:56:48,180 --> 07:56:50,628
which is why we are declaring a threat
to safety

15870
07:56:50,628 --> 07:56:50,638
to safety
 

15871
07:56:50,638 --> 07:56:53,628
to safety
oh we will be rewinding of two years

15872
07:56:53,628 --> 07:56:53,638
oh we will be rewinding of two years
 

15873
07:56:53,638 --> 07:56:55,490
oh we will be rewinding of two years
using every last bit of entropy energy

15874
07:56:55,490 --> 07:56:55,500
using every last bit of entropy energy
 

15875
07:56:55,500 --> 07:56:57,770
using every last bit of entropy energy
we have we know our future now but I

15876
07:56:57,770 --> 07:56:57,780
we have we know our future now but I
 

15877
07:56:57,780 --> 07:56:59,150
we have we know our future now but I
hope we can enjoy

15878
07:56:59,150 --> 07:56:59,160
hope we can enjoy
 

15879
07:56:59,160 --> 07:57:01,190
hope we can enjoy
these final years two years on Earth

15880
07:57:01,190 --> 07:57:01,200
these final years two years on Earth
 

15881
07:57:01,200 --> 07:57:03,048
these final years two years on Earth
enjoying what we do have I've heard it's

this is so interesting

15890

15891
07:57:16,760 --> 07:57:18,948

but I need to go to an island meeting

15892
07:57:18,948 --> 07:57:18,958
but I need to go to an island meeting
 

15893
07:57:18,958 --> 07:57:22,490
but I need to go to an island meeting
again and I'm tired I guess and I'm

15894
07:57:22,490 --> 07:57:22,500
again and I'm tired I guess and I'm
 

15895

hungry sheesh I hope we're finishing

15896
07:57:25,490 --> 07:57:25,500
hungry sheesh I hope we're finishing
 

15897
07:57:25,500 --> 07:57:26,930
hungry sheesh I hope we're finishing
this soon

15898
07:57:26,930 --> 07:57:26,940
this soon
 

15899
07:57:26,940 --> 07:57:29,628
this soon
and how come that junk

15900
07:57:29,628 --> 07:57:29,638
and how come that junk
 

15901
07:57:29,638 --> 07:57:33,110
and how come that junk
made me go

15902
07:57:33,110 --> 07:57:33,120

 

15903
07:57:33,120 --> 07:57:38,208

backwards are they

15904
07:57:38,208 --> 07:57:38,218

 

15905
07:57:38,218 --> 07:57:40,368

what

15906
07:57:40,368 --> 07:57:40,378

 

15907
07:57:40,378 --> 07:57:42,770

maybe I'm supposed to land exactly on it

15908
07:57:42,770 --> 07:57:42,780
maybe I'm supposed to land exactly on it
 

15909
07:57:42,780 --> 07:57:47,570
maybe I'm supposed to land exactly on it
I don't think I can

15910
07:57:47,570 --> 07:57:47,580

 

15911
07:57:47,580 --> 07:57:50,208

see it goes in and goes out and just

15912
07:57:50,208 --> 07:57:50,218
see it goes in and goes out and just
 

15913
07:57:50,218 --> 07:57:52,368
see it goes in and goes out and just
like for the moment that I drink it

15914
07:57:52,368 --> 07:57:52,378
like for the moment that I drink it
 

15915
07:57:52,378 --> 07:57:55,490
like for the moment that I drink it
that's when it helps but then

15916
07:57:55,490 --> 07:57:55,500
that's when it helps but then
 

15917
07:57:55,500 --> 07:58:04,548
that's when it helps but then
seconds later it hurts again

15918
07:58:04,548 --> 07:58:04,558

 

15919
07:58:04,558 --> 07:58:08,810

rewind the thing in the middle

15920
07:58:08,810 --> 07:58:08,820

15925
07:58:16,260 --> 07:58:18,670

ah

ah
something there ah why is it so hard to

15928
07:58:21,830 --> 07:58:21,840
something there ah why is it so hard to
 

15929
07:58:21,840 --> 07:58:29,448
something there ah why is it so hard to
see that that was rewindable

15930
07:58:29,448 --> 07:58:29,458

that will be necessary to open those

16298
08:08:15,590 --> 08:08:15,600
that will be necessary to open those
 

16299
08:08:15,600 --> 08:08:18,590
that will be necessary to open those
doors one by one

16300
08:08:18,590 --> 08:08:18,600
doors one by one
 

16301
08:08:18,600 --> 08:08:21,048

16345
08:09:34,558 --> 08:09:36,230
when it goes back I can look at it I
guess

16346

08:36:50,340 --> 08:36:53,690
the bridge kill for the button uh by
rewinding after I've walked over

17144
08:36:53,690 --> 08:36:53,700
rewinding after I've walked over
 

17145
08:36:53,700 --> 08:36:58,868
rewinding after I've walked over
so this man

so

17150
08:37:21,350 --> 08:37:21,360

 

17151
08:37:21,360 --> 08:37:23,810

that still means I have to bring it up

17152
08:37:23,810 --> 08:37:23,820
that still means I have to bring it up
 

17153
08:37:23,820 --> 08:37:26,468
that still means I have to bring it up
one more time

17154
08:37:26,468 --> 08:37:26,478
one more time
 

17155
08:37:26,478 --> 08:37:30,048
one more time
one one time I wanna I survived to enter

17156
08:37:30,048 --> 08:37:30,058
one one time I wanna I survived to enter
 

17157
08:37:30,058 --> 08:37:33,650
one one time I wanna I survived to enter
the path shirts what no I don't think I

17158
08:37:33,650 --> 08:37:33,660
the path shirts what no I don't think I
 

17159
08:37:33,660 --> 08:37:35,030
the path shirts what no I don't think I
agree with that because that implies

17160
08:37:35,030 --> 08:37:35,040
agree with that because that implies
 

17161
08:37:35,040 --> 08:37:37,850
agree with that because that implies
that this was unbearable and just

17162
08:37:37,850 --> 08:37:37,860
that this was unbearable and just
 

17163
08:37:37,860 --> 08:37:40,128
that this was unbearable and just
suffering and I don't think that's

17164
08:37:40,128 --> 08:37:40,138
suffering and I don't think that's
 

17165
08:37:40,138 --> 08:37:44,030
suffering and I don't think that's
really true I survived kiwawa's tunic

17166
08:37:44,030 --> 08:37:44,040
really true I survived kiwawa's tunic
 

17167
08:37:44,040 --> 08:37:47,690
really true I survived kiwawa's tunic
playthrough would maybe be or I survived

17168
08:37:47,690 --> 08:37:47,700
playthrough would maybe be or I survived
 

17169
08:37:47,700 --> 08:37:50,170
playthrough would maybe be or I survived
the making of the golden path would be

17170
08:37:50,170 --> 08:37:50,180
the making of the golden path would be
 

17171
08:37:50,180 --> 08:37:55,788
the making of the golden path would be
more fitting in my opinion

17172
08:37:55,788 --> 08:37:55,798

 

17173
08:37:55,798 --> 08:37:57,590

but not that

17174
08:37:57,590 --> 08:37:57,600
but not that
 

17175
08:37:57,600 --> 08:38:00,110
but not that
not this one

17176
08:38:00,110 --> 08:38:00,120
not this one
 

17177
08:38:00,120 --> 08:38:04,430
not this one
I don't think so

17178
08:38:04,430 --> 08:38:04,440

 

17179
08:38:04,440 --> 08:38:07,128

08:38:15,230 --> 08:38:15,240
warm up but a good streamer
 

17185
08:38:15,240 --> 08:38:18,230
warm up but a good streamer
always needs some warm-up yeah

17186
08:38:18,230 --> 08:38:18,240
always needs some warm-up yeah
 

17187
08:38:18,240 --> 08:38:23,750
always needs some warm-up yeah
okay I guess we're just repeating

17188
08:38:23,750 --> 08:38:23,760

 

17189
08:38:23,760 --> 08:38:25,368

this

17190
08:38:25,368 --> 08:38:25,378
this
 

17191
08:38:25,378 --> 08:38:28,010
this
like we will go up again

17192
08:38:28,010 --> 08:38:28,020
like we will go up again
 

17193
08:38:28,020 --> 08:38:31,190
like we will go up again
up here but we also need the laser

17194
08:38:31,190 --> 08:38:31,200
up here but we also need the laser

make it never mind maybe it's not by

17198
08:38:38,208 --> 08:38:38,218
make it never mind maybe it's not by
 

17199
08:38:38,218 --> 08:38:43,190
make it never mind maybe it's not by

17200
08:38:43,190 --> 08:38:43,200

 

17201
08:38:43,200 --> 08:38:48,128

08:38:48,128 --> 08:38:48,138
we are no I'm Dreaming now
 

17203
08:38:48,138 --> 08:38:50,930
we are no I'm Dreaming now
I was thinking I need to rescue that

17204
08:38:50,930 --> 08:38:50,940
I was thinking I need to rescue that
 

17205
08:38:50,940 --> 08:38:53,810
I was thinking I need to rescue that
kill but I mean I don't need the laser

17206
08:38:53,810 --> 08:38:53,820
kill but I mean I don't need the laser
 

17207
08:38:53,820 --> 08:39:00,490
kill but I mean I don't need the laser
Cube

17208
08:39:00,490 --> 08:39:00,500

 

17209
08:39:00,500 --> 08:39:02,750

that's what I did

17210
08:39:02,750 --> 08:39:02,760
that's what I did
 

17211
08:39:02,760 --> 08:39:05,388
that's what I did
you did it this way kind of

17212
08:39:05,388 --> 08:39:05,398
you did it this way kind of
 

17213
08:39:05,398 --> 08:39:12,590
you did it this way kind of
I mean what might also work

17214
08:39:12,590 --> 08:39:12,600

 

17215
08:39:12,600 --> 08:39:15,530

um

17216
08:39:15,530 --> 08:39:15,540

 

17217
08:39:15,540 --> 08:39:18,288

like can you really consider that cheap

17218
08:39:18,288 --> 08:39:18,298
like can you really consider that cheap
 

17219
08:39:18,298 --> 08:39:20,388
like can you really consider that cheap
thing I don't know I can't jump like

17220
08:39:20,388 --> 08:39:20,398
thing I don't know I can't jump like
 

17221
08:39:20,398 --> 08:39:23,388
thing I don't know I can't jump like
that though but I can make the bridge

17222
08:39:23,388 --> 08:39:23,398
that though but I can make the bridge
 

17223
08:39:23,398 --> 08:39:25,788
that though but I can make the bridge
over here and walk over just what the

17224
08:39:25,788 --> 08:39:25,798
over here and walk over just what the
 

17225
08:39:25,798 --> 08:39:28,690
over here and walk over just what the
with this one

17226
08:39:28,690 --> 08:39:28,700
with this one
 

17227
08:39:28,700 --> 08:39:36,350
with this one
what it's not always so complicated

17228
08:39:36,350 --> 08:39:36,360

 

17229
08:39:36,360 --> 08:39:39,708

okay okay okay

17230
08:39:39,708 --> 08:39:39,718

 

17231
08:39:39,718 --> 08:39:48,670

I'll just move the bridge oh

17232
08:39:48,670 --> 08:39:48,680

 

17233
08:39:48,680 --> 08:39:51,350

uh because I don't currently need to go

17234
08:39:51,350 --> 08:39:51,360
uh because I don't currently need to go
 

17235
08:39:51,360 --> 08:39:53,030
uh because I don't currently need to go
there anymore I'll just have to put it

17236
08:39:53,030 --> 08:39:53,040
there anymore I'll just have to put it
 

17237
08:39:53,040 --> 08:39:57,530
there anymore I'll just have to put it
back properly again

17238
08:39:57,530 --> 08:39:57,540

 

17239
08:39:57,540 --> 08:39:59,448

sure

17240
08:39:59,448 --> 08:39:59,458
sure
 

17241
08:39:59,458 --> 08:40:02,448
sure
and that is the real it's simpler than

17242
08:40:02,448 --> 08:40:02,458
and that is the real it's simpler than
 

17243
08:40:02,458 --> 08:40:04,368
and that is the real it's simpler than
that

17244
08:40:04,368 --> 08:40:04,378
that
 

17245
08:40:04,378 --> 08:40:06,490
that
foreign

17246
08:40:06,490 --> 08:40:06,500
foreign
 

17247
08:40:06,500 --> 08:40:09,170
foreign
but this feels like the real solution I

17248
08:40:09,170 --> 08:40:09,180
but this feels like the real solution I
 

17249
08:40:09,180 --> 08:40:18,110
but this feels like the real solution I
was about to say that

17250
08:40:18,110 --> 08:40:18,120

 

17251
08:40:18,120 --> 08:40:21,948

no way but this works and this is what

17252
08:40:21,948 --> 08:40:21,958
no way but this works and this is what
 

17253
08:40:21,958 --> 08:40:25,490
no way but this works and this is what
came to my mind

17254
08:40:25,490 --> 08:40:25,500

 

17255
08:40:25,500 --> 08:40:27,590

so who says it's not the real solution

17256
08:40:27,590 --> 08:40:27,600
so who says it's not the real solution
 

17257
08:40:27,600 --> 08:40:33,190
so who says it's not the real solution
eh

17258
08:40:33,190 --> 08:40:33,200

 

17259
08:40:33,200 --> 08:40:38,628

17267

I don't need yeah the reason why I
thought this was the one is because I

17268
08:40:49,368 --> 08:40:49,378
thought this was the one is because I
 

17269
08:40:49,378 --> 08:40:51,288
thought this was the one is because I
don't need the jump pad anymore after

17270
08:40:51,288 --> 08:40:51,298
don't need the jump pad anymore after
 

17271

fall down on that
 

17553
08:49:53,160 --> 08:50:00,670
fall down on that
or preferably a little bit closer though

17554
08:50:00,670 --> 08:50:00,680

 

17555
08:50:00,680 --> 08:50:04,548

it did say the last achievement was um
 

18615

it did say the last achievement was um
it said Loop

it said Loop

09:26:23,416 --> 09:26:31,670

no that's like so unsatisfying

18622
09:26:31,670 --> 09:26:31,680

 

18623
09:26:31,680 --> 09:26:34,670

what does that mean she returned

18624
09:26:34,670 --> 09:26:34,680
what does that mean she returned
 

18625
09:26:34,680 --> 09:26:36,230
what does that mean she returned
um to like

18626
09:26:36,230 --> 09:26:36,240
um to like
 

18627
09:26:36,240 --> 09:26:39,470
um to like
a day before so but it's like jumping

18628
09:26:39,470 --> 09:26:39,480
a day before so but it's like jumping
 

18629
09:26:39,480 --> 09:26:44,150
a day before so but it's like jumping
over to the next timeline

18630

18631
09:26:44,160 --> 09:26:45,710

I mean it kind of feels like all this

18632
09:26:45,710 --> 09:26:45,720
I mean it kind of feels like all this
 

18633
09:26:45,720 --> 09:26:51,650
I mean it kind of feels like all this
happened in one day but uh

18634
09:26:51,650 --> 09:26:51,660

 

18635
09:26:51,660 --> 09:26:53,450

so she's just rewinding it again even

18636
09:26:53,450 --> 09:26:53,460
so she's just rewinding it again even
 

18637
09:26:53,460 --> 09:26:56,510
so she's just rewinding it again even
though she kept on telling her to

18638
09:26:56,510 --> 09:26:56,520
though she kept on telling her to
 

18639
09:26:56,520 --> 09:26:58,246
though she kept on telling her to
not rewind it and I felt like she

18640
09:26:58,246 --> 09:26:58,256
not rewind it and I felt like she
 

18641
09:26:58,256 --> 09:27:00,710
not rewind it and I felt like she
understood it I thought she understood

18642
09:27:00,710 --> 09:27:00,720
understood it I thought she understood
 

18643
09:27:00,720 --> 09:27:02,210
understood it I thought she understood
it

18644
09:27:02,210 --> 09:27:02,220

18647
09:27:07,700 --> 09:27:11,510

09:27:11,510 --> 09:27:11,520
but I mean I think it's a funny idea in
 

18649
09:27:11,520 --> 09:27:14,690

18657
09:27:22,500 --> 09:27:23,926

18663
09:27:29,700 --> 09:27:31,790

09:27:31,790 --> 09:27:31,800
she accepted that she's in the loop but
 

18665
09:27:31,800 --> 09:27:35,350
she accepted that she's in the loop but
like couldn't she end it too

18666
09:27:35,350 --> 09:27:35,360
like couldn't she end it too
 

18667
09:27:35,360 --> 09:27:39,290

but I mean there was some drastic
 

18669
09:27:39,300 --> 09:27:42,830

18687
09:28:16,200 --> 09:28:18,530
so I did not do her a favor of that is
that what you're saying

that what you're saying
 

18689
09:28:18,540 --> 09:28:20,266

yeah I guess she thinks she's solving in

09:28:20,266 --> 09:28:20,276
yeah I guess she thinks she's solving in
 

18691
09:28:20,276 --> 09:28:23,630
yeah I guess she thinks she's solving in
it but no like a previous Arias told her

18692
09:28:23,630 --> 09:28:23,640
it but no like a previous Arias told her
 

18693
09:28:23,640 --> 09:28:25,690
it but no like a previous Arias told her
to stop it because they understood

18694
09:28:25,690 --> 09:28:25,700
to stop it because they understood
 

18695
09:28:25,700 --> 09:28:28,010
to stop it because they understood
but even though they claim to understand

18696

but even though they claim to understand
 

18697
09:28:28,020 --> 09:28:30,890
but even though they claim to understand
it they still choose to repeat it

18698
09:28:30,890 --> 09:28:30,900
it they still choose to repeat it
 

18699
09:28:30,900 --> 09:28:33,830
it they still choose to repeat it
maybe because they thought that step

18700
09:28:33,830 --> 09:28:33,840
maybe because they thought that step
 

18701
09:28:33,840 --> 09:28:36,406
maybe because they thought that step
they were taking at that point

18702
09:28:36,406 --> 09:28:36,416
they were taking at that point
 

18703
09:28:36,416 --> 09:28:40,070
they were taking at that point
was the way to end the loop but they've
