i was thinking i i saw that i had

1340
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:11,200
i was thinking i i saw that i had
 

1341
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,990
i was thinking i i saw that i had
gandagoza but i was like but if i evolve

1342
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:14,000
gandagoza but i was like but if i evolve
 

1343
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,070
gandagoza but i was like but if i evolve
him i only get up to nine oh that was

1344
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:16,080
him i only get up to nine oh that was
 

1345
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,070
him i only get up to nine oh that was
against kelly okay okay okay the second

1346
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:18,080
against kelly okay okay okay the second
 

1347
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,669
against kelly okay okay okay the second
one against count

1348
00:28:19,669 --> 00:28:19,679
one against count
 

1349
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,830
one against count
i guess so maybe uh whatever

1350
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:21,840
i guess so maybe uh whatever
 

1351
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,750
i guess so maybe uh whatever
it was some match where where the

1352
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:23,760
it was some match where where the
 

1353
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,990
it was some match where where the
opponent had ten half points left and i

1354
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:26,000
opponent had ten half points left and i
 

1355
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,990
opponent had ten half points left and i
thought that if i evolved ganagoza it

1356
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:28,000
thought that if i evolved ganagoza it
 

1357
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,430
thought that if i evolved ganagoza it
would only have nine not ten attack that

1358
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:31,440

just the fact that it's a tournament
brings so much pressure with it

brings so much pressure with it
 

1879
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:25,270
brings so much pressure with it
and especially when there's someone in

it was just like a tiny tiny tiny slice

2920
01:01:12,230 --> 01:01:12,240
it was just like a tiny tiny tiny slice
 

2921
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,589
it was just like a tiny tiny tiny slice
two slices

2922
01:01:13,589 --> 01:01:13,599
two slices
 

2923
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:15,030
two slices
but

2924
01:01:15,030 --> 01:01:15,040
but
 

2925
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:17,109
but
the thing is it was such a tiny slice

2926
01:01:17,109 --> 01:01:17,119
the thing is it was such a tiny slice
 

2927
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:19,270
the thing is it was such a tiny slice
that that it would constantly fill up

2928
01:01:19,270 --> 01:01:19,280
that that it would constantly fill up
 

2929
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,430
that that it would constantly fill up
with sand

2930
01:01:21,430 --> 01:01:21,440
with sand
 

2931
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:24,549
with sand
and when if i would wash it out it'll

2932
01:01:24,549 --> 01:01:24,559
and when if i would wash it out it'll
 

2933
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:26,549
and when if i would wash it out it'll
fill up it with sand again because if

2934
01:01:26,549 --> 01:01:26,559
fill up it with sand again because if
 

2935
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:28,470
fill up it with sand again because if
you walk in the sand

2936
01:01:28,470 --> 01:01:28,480
you walk in the sand
 

2937
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,230

i suddenly felt like doing it because i
 

3323
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,790
i suddenly felt like doing it because i
had suddenly pain

3327
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:47,669
and like i don't know tension tension i
guess

3328
01:13:47,669 --> 01:13:47,679
guess
 

3329
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:49,110
guess
in that area

3330
01:13:49,110 --> 01:13:49,120
in that area
 

3331
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:51,830
in that area
and but i was never really sure

3332
01:13:51,830 --> 01:13:51,840
and but i was never really sure
 

3333
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:54,070
and but i was never really sure
what exactly caused it

3334
01:13:54,070 --> 01:13:54,080
what exactly caused it
 

3335
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:55,510
what exactly caused it
but i do think

3336
01:13:55,510 --> 01:13:55,520
but i do think
 

3337
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:58,149
but i do think
there might be one cause one reason

3338
01:13:58,149 --> 01:13:58,159
there might be one cause one reason
 

3339
01:13:58,159 --> 01:13:59,030
there might be one cause one reason
because

3340
01:13:59,030 --> 01:13:59,040
because
 

3341
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:01,750
because
looking back on it now the timeline kind

3342
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:01,760
looking back on it now the timeline kind
 

3343
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:04,550
looking back on it now the timeline kind
of matches up and it kind of makes sense

3344
01:14:04,550 --> 01:14:04,560
of matches up and it kind of makes sense
 

3345
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:08,310
of matches up and it kind of makes sense
um

3346
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:08,320

i i remember that

3448
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:03,360
i i remember that
 

3449
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:05,990
i i remember that
because it really hurts afterwards and

3450
01:16:05,990 --> 01:16:06,000
because it really hurts afterwards and
 

3451
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,590
because it really hurts afterwards and
it hurt for a while

3452
01:16:07,590 --> 01:16:07,600
it hurt for a while
 

3453
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,030
it hurt for a while
and i think

3454
01:16:09,030 --> 01:16:09,040
and i think
 

3455
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:11,910
and i think
this is what caused the common year

3456
01:16:11,910 --> 01:16:11,920
this is what caused the common year
 

3457
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:14,470
this is what caused the common year
of the following years of me cracking my

3458
01:16:14,470 --> 01:16:14,480
of the following years of me cracking my
 

3459
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:15,990
of the following years of me cracking my
neck

3460
01:16:15,990 --> 01:16:16,000
neck
 

3461
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,390
neck
all the [\h__\h] time because i still

3462
01:16:18,390 --> 01:16:18,400
all the [\h__\h] time because i still
 

3463
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:19,590
all the [\h__\h] time because i still
feel

3464
01:16:19,590 --> 01:16:19,600
feel
 

3465
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:21,270
feel
some

3466
01:16:21,270 --> 01:16:21,280
some
 

3467
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:22,229
some
pain

3468
01:16:22,229 --> 01:16:22,239
pain
 

3469
01:16:22,239 --> 01:16:25,350
pain
and tension or whatever

3470
01:16:25,350 --> 01:16:25,360
and tension or whatever
 

3471
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:27,990
and tension or whatever
i think in the same spot

3472
01:16:27,990 --> 01:16:28,000
i think in the same spot
 

3473
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,950
i think in the same spot
so i think that might be

3474
01:16:30,950 --> 01:16:30,960
so i think that might be
 

3475
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:32,830
so i think that might be
uh

3476
01:16:32,830 --> 01:16:32,840
uh
 

3477
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:34,550

going
i don't really remember if i really did

3506
01:17:01,030 --> 01:17:01,040
i don't really remember if i really did
 

3507
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:02,790
i don't really remember if i really did
keep on going but i think i kept on

3508
01:17:02,790 --> 01:17:02,800
keep on going but i think i kept on
 

3509
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:04,470
keep on going but i think i kept on
going for like a little tiny bit and

3510
01:17:04,470 --> 01:17:04,480
going for like a little tiny bit and
 

3511
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:07,030
going for like a little tiny bit and
then i was like nah i'm dead i can't i

3512
01:17:07,030 --> 01:17:07,040
then i was like nah i'm dead i can't i
 

3513
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:09,669
then i was like nah i'm dead i can't i
can't i hurt myself

3514
01:17:09,669 --> 01:17:09,679
can't i hurt myself
 

3515
01:17:09,679 --> 01:17:11,669
can't i hurt myself
so

3516
01:17:11,669 --> 01:17:11,679
so
 

3517
01:17:11,679 --> 01:17:14,830
so
so that's um the reason like probably

3518
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:14,840
so that's um the reason like probably
 

3519
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:17,030
so that's um the reason like probably
maybe not for sure but probably the

3520
01:17:17,030 --> 01:17:17,040
maybe not for sure but probably the
 

3521
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:19,510
maybe not for sure but probably the
reason why i keep on doing that and i

3522
01:17:19,510 --> 01:17:19,520
reason why i keep on doing that and i
 

3523
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:21,189
reason why i keep on doing that and i

always thought that there's still
something

3526
01:17:23,030 --> 01:17:23,040
