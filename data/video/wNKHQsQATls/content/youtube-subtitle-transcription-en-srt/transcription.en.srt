that's part of the reason why I wanted
 

2587
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:15,830
that's part of the reason why I wanted
to try this stream like it's something

2588
01:26:15,830 --> 01:26:15,840
to try this stream like it's something
 

2589
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:17,689
to try this stream like it's something
that I don't think a lot of people have

2590
01:26:17,689 --> 01:26:17,699
that I don't think a lot of people have
 

2591
01:26:17,699 --> 01:26:21,169
that I don't think a lot of people have
tried like in terms of v-tubing see I

2592
01:26:21,169 --> 01:26:21,179
tried like in terms of v-tubing see I
 

2593
01:26:21,179 --> 01:26:22,790
tried like in terms of v-tubing see I
definitely thought it'd be good to

2594
01:26:22,790 --> 01:26:22,800
definitely thought it'd be good to
 

2595
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:24,410
definitely thought it'd be good to
experiment a little bit even though it's

2596
01:26:24,410 --> 01:26:24,420
experiment a little bit even though it's
 

2597
01:26:24,420 --> 01:26:25,910
experiment a little bit even though it's
it's kind of scary because I was like

2598
01:26:25,910 --> 01:26:25,920
it's kind of scary because I was like
 

2599
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:27,770
it's kind of scary because I was like
thinking uh maybe it's gonna fail maybe

2600
