it's for later but the Pokemon are On My

712
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:52,500
it's for later but the Pokemon are On My
 

713
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,549
it's for later but the Pokemon are On My
Level now

714
00:22:54,549 --> 00:22:54,559
Level now
 

715
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,110
Level now
show hmm

716
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:57,120
show hmm
 

717
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,690
show hmm
I guess you have to revisit it and then

718
00:22:59,690 --> 00:22:59,700
I guess you have to revisit it and then
 

719
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,090
I guess you have to revisit it and then
the Pokemon are super low level it's

720
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:02,100
the Pokemon are super low level it's
 

721
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,390
the Pokemon are super low level it's
kind of weird but yeah yeah

722
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:05,400
kind of weird but yeah yeah
 

723
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,909
kind of weird but yeah yeah
um I think so this is probably where I

724
00:23:07,909 --> 00:23:07,919
um I think so this is probably where I
 

725
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,590
um I think so this is probably where I
caught my dolphin

726
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:09,600
caught my dolphin
 

727
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,390
caught my dolphin
at some point

728
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:11,400
at some point
 

729
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,430
at some point
uh

730
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:13,440
uh
 

731
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,110
uh
oh yeah yeah yeah

732
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:15,120
oh yeah yeah yeah
 

733
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,090
oh yeah yeah yeah
yeah

734
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:16,100
yeah
 

735
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,529
yeah
but I guess

736
00:23:18,529 --> 00:23:18,539
but I guess
 

737
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:20,870
but I guess
I still didn't do enough trainers

738
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:20,880
I still didn't do enough trainers
 

739
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,190
I still didn't do enough trainers
right

740
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:22,200
right
 

741
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,590
right
that's so weird like I I fought way more

742
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:24,600
that's so weird like I I fought way more
 

743
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,330
that's so weird like I I fought way more
than five but I guess they counted for a

744
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:26,340
than five but I guess they counted for a
 

745
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:29,649
than five but I guess they counted for a
different region confusing

746
00:23:29,649 --> 00:23:29,659
different region confusing
 

747
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:32,630
different region confusing
so I could continue exploring here

748
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:32,640
so I could continue exploring here
 

749
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,570
so I could continue exploring here
especially because of that slump or

750
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:35,580
especially because of that slump or
 

751
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,250
especially because of that slump or
because we're already quite over leveled

752
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:37,260
because we're already quite over leveled
 

753
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:42,350
because we're already quite over leveled
I think we could go

754
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:42,360

 

755
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,830

and you don't see them there were in the
 

4333
01:59:26,159 --> 01:59:29,209
and you don't see them there were in the
mud and he really got a good eye for

4334
01:59:29,209 --> 01:59:29,219
mud and he really got a good eye for
 

4335
01:59:29,219 --> 01:59:31,790
mud and he really got a good eye for
them and then he he goes up to them he

4336
01:59:31,790 --> 01:59:31,800
them and then he he goes up to them he
 

4337
01:59:31,800 --> 01:59:33,709
them and then he he goes up to them he
pokes them to see if it's really one of

4338
01:59:33,709 --> 01:59:33,719
pokes them to see if it's really one of
 

4339
01:59:33,719 --> 01:59:34,609
pokes them to see if it's really one of
them

4340
01:59:34,609 --> 01:59:34,619
them
 

4341
01:59:34,619 --> 01:59:37,250
them
and then they then they come out of the

4342
01:59:37,250 --> 01:59:37,260
and then they then they come out of the
 

4343
01:59:37,260 --> 01:59:38,209
and then they then they come out of the
mud

4344
01:59:38,209 --> 01:59:38,219
mud
 

4345
01:59:38,219 --> 01:59:41,750
mud
and they're so big she'll speak crabs so

4346
01:59:41,750 --> 01:59:41,760
and they're so big she'll speak crabs so
 

4347
01:59:41,760 --> 01:59:43,910
and they're so big she'll speak crabs so
cute though

4348
01:59:43,910 --> 01:59:43,920
cute though
 

4349
01:59:43,920 --> 01:59:45,890
cute though
and they go like Snap Snap with their

4350
01:59:45,890 --> 01:59:45,900
and they go like Snap Snap with their
 

4351
01:59:45,900 --> 01:59:48,589
and they go like Snap Snap with their
big claws and apparently there's like a

4352
01:59:48,589 --> 01:59:48,599
big claws and apparently there's like a
 

4353
01:59:48,599 --> 01:59:51,290
big claws and apparently there's like a
illegal size that it has to have

4354
01:59:51,290 --> 01:59:51,300
illegal size that it has to have
 

4355
01:59:51,300 --> 01:59:54,410
illegal size that it has to have
in order to like be allowed to catch and

4356
01:59:54,410 --> 01:59:54,420
in order to like be allowed to catch and
 

4357
01:59:54,420 --> 01:59:57,350
in order to like be allowed to catch and
cook it and it's not allowed to be a

4358
01:59:57,350 --> 01:59:57,360
cook it and it's not allowed to be a
 

4359
01:59:57,360 --> 01:59:59,689
cook it and it's not allowed to be a
female apparently because I guess if you

4360
01:59:59,689 --> 01:59:59,699
female apparently because I guess if you
 

4361
01:59:59,699 --> 02:00:01,430
female apparently because I guess if you
take the females then

4362
02:00:01,430 --> 02:00:01,440
take the females then
 

4363
02:00:01,440 --> 02:00:04,550
take the females then
they'll have problems breeding I suppose

4364
02:00:04,550 --> 02:00:04,560
they'll have problems breeding I suppose
 

4365
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:06,709
they'll have problems breeding I suppose
so that's cool that there there's these

4366
02:00:06,709 --> 02:00:06,719
so that's cool that there there's these
 

4367
02:00:06,719 --> 02:00:09,229
so that's cool that there there's these
uh minimum sizes and you have to follow

4368
02:00:09,229 --> 02:00:09,239
uh minimum sizes and you have to follow
 

4369
02:00:09,239 --> 02:00:11,089
uh minimum sizes and you have to follow
them

4370
02:00:11,089 --> 02:00:11,099
them
 

4371
02:00:11,099 --> 02:00:14,390
them
in order to you know not

4372
02:00:14,390 --> 02:00:14,400
in order to you know not
 

4373
02:00:14,400 --> 02:00:18,129
in order to you know not

so he always has like a like a measurer

4376
02:00:24,070 --> 02:00:24,080
so he always has like a like a measurer
 

4377
02:00:24,080 --> 02:00:27,109
so he always has like a like a measurer
but he kind of knows it by heart already

4378
02:00:27,109 --> 02:00:27,119
but he kind of knows it by heart already
 

4379
02:00:27,119 --> 02:00:28,790
but he kind of knows it by heart already
because he's been doing that since he's

4380
02:00:28,790 --> 02:00:28,800
because he's been doing that since he's
 

4381
02:00:28,800 --> 02:00:31,010
because he's been doing that since he's
like really small

02:00:31,010 --> 02:00:31,020
like really small
 

4383
02:00:31,020 --> 02:00:32,810
like really small

so cool
 

4385
02:00:32,820 --> 02:00:34,850
so cool
and then he catches the mud crab from

4386
02:00:34,850 --> 02:00:34,860
and then he catches the mud crab from
 

4387
02:00:34,860 --> 02:00:36,770
and then he catches the mud crab from
behind

4388
02:00:36,770 --> 02:00:36,780
behind
 

4389
02:00:36,780 --> 02:00:40,490

I just exploded catches it from behind

4390
02:00:40,490 --> 02:00:40,500
I just exploded catches it from behind
 

4391
02:00:40,500 --> 02:00:42,649
I just exploded catches it from behind
and picks it up and then throws it in a

4392

it in some water and then ever eats it
like that sometimes he does some recipes

4400
02:00:54,290 --> 02:00:54,300
like that sometimes he does some recipes
 

4401
02:00:54,300 --> 02:00:55,729
like that sometimes he does some recipes
with them

4402
02:00:55,729 --> 02:00:55,739
with them
 

4403
02:00:55,739 --> 02:00:58,010
with them
that are not like the most chef-like

4404
02:00:58,010 --> 02:00:58,020
that are not like the most chef-like
 

4405
02:00:58,020 --> 02:01:00,109
that are not like the most chef-like
recipes but

4406
02:01:00,109 --> 02:01:00,119
recipes but
 

4407
02:01:00,119 --> 02:01:02,270
recipes but
it's like really really simplistic

4408
02:01:02,270 --> 02:01:02,280
it's like really really simplistic
 

4409
02:01:02,280 --> 02:01:05,330
it's like really really simplistic
recipes what is this Stone what can I

would probably be scared of a lot of

4424
02:01:31,970 --> 02:01:31,980
would probably be scared of a lot of
 

4425
02:01:31,980 --> 02:01:36,050
would probably be scared of a lot of
those techniques or things but

4426
02:01:36,050 --> 02:01:36,060
those techniques or things but
 

4427
02:01:36,060 --> 02:01:40,010
those techniques or things but
I don't know it felt like so refreshing

4428
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:40,020
I don't know it felt like so refreshing
 

4429
02:01:40,020 --> 02:01:42,950
I don't know it felt like so refreshing
to watch that

4430
02:01:42,950 --> 02:01:42,960

 

4431
02:01:42,960 --> 02:01:46,850

like some videos were also like 48 hours

4432

how she's I don't know what those fishes
 

4445
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:07,310
how she's I don't know what those fishes
are I look at the fish when I say that's

4446
02:02:07,310 --> 02:02:07,320
are I look at the fish when I say that's
 

4447
02:02:07,320 --> 02:02:09,290
are I look at the fish when I say that's
a fish but I didn't know you can eat all

4448
02:02:09,290 --> 02:02:09,300
a fish but I didn't know you can eat all
 

4449
02:02:09,300 --> 02:02:11,030
a fish but I didn't know you can eat all
of those different fish

4450
02:02:11,030 --> 02:02:11,040
of those different fish
 

4451
02:02:11,040 --> 02:02:14,330
of those different fish
I mean I guess you can eat all fish but

4452
02:02:14,330 --> 02:02:14,340
I mean I guess you can eat all fish but
 

4453
02:02:14,340 --> 02:02:16,310
I mean I guess you can eat all fish but
are they gonna taste good I didn't

4454
02:02:16,310 --> 02:02:16,320
are they gonna taste good I didn't
 

4455
02:02:16,320 --> 02:02:18,229
are they gonna taste good I didn't
expect so you can just take all these

4456
02:02:18,229 --> 02:02:18,239
expect so you can just take all these
 

4457
02:02:18,239 --> 02:02:19,750
expect so you can just take all these
fishies and they all taste good

4458
02:02:19,750 --> 02:02:19,760
fishies and they all taste good
 

4459
02:02:19,760 --> 02:02:22,910
fishies and they all taste good
apparently they do

4460
02:02:22,910 --> 02:02:22,920
apparently they do
 

4461
02:02:22,920 --> 02:02:25,089
apparently they do
I know

4462
02:02:25,089 --> 02:02:25,099
I know

4465
02:02:29,900 --> 02:02:32,870

and then I also learned that

4466
02:02:32,870 --> 02:02:32,880
and then I also learned that
 

4467
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:34,669
and then I also learned that
I know I learned a lot of things from

4468
02:02:34,669 --> 02:02:34,679
I know I learned a lot of things from
 

4469
02:02:34,679 --> 02:02:37,790
I know I learned a lot of things from
that about fish

4470
02:02:37,790 --> 02:02:37,800
that about fish
 

4471
02:02:37,800 --> 02:02:40,729
that about fish
oh I even looked at one thing he did was

4472
02:02:40,729 --> 02:02:40,739
oh I even looked at one thing he did was
 

4473
02:02:40,739 --> 02:02:41,810
oh I even looked at one thing he did was
like

4474
02:02:41,810 --> 02:02:41,820
like
 

4475
02:02:41,820 --> 02:02:45,950
like
um if he caught a fish right and then he

4476
02:02:45,950 --> 02:02:45,960
um if he caught a fish right and then he
 

4477
02:02:45,960 --> 02:02:47,270
um if he caught a fish right and then he
fillets it

4478
02:02:47,270 --> 02:02:47,280
fillets it
 

4479
02:02:47,280 --> 02:02:48,790
fillets it
at the spot

4480
02:02:48,790 --> 02:02:48,800
at the spot
 

4481
02:02:48,800 --> 02:02:51,350
at the spot
and oh

4482
02:02:51,350 --> 02:02:51,360
and oh

4486
02:02:57,169 --> 02:02:57,179
with him then he'd just start squeezed
 

4487
02:02:57,179 --> 02:02:58,970
with him then he'd just start squeezed
all the lemon juice

4488
02:02:58,970 --> 02:02:58,980
all the lemon juice
 

4489
02:02:58,980 --> 02:03:00,950
