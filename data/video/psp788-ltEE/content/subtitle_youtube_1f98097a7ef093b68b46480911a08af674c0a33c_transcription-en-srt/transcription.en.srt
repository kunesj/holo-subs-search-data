like challenges I'm in a breeze uh maybe
 

2209
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:19,750
like challenges I'm in a breeze uh maybe
because like the first time when I

2210
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:19,760
because like the first time when I

2541
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:48,630
that really bothers me in like animes
and movies or whatever like when mostly

2542
01:07:48,630 --> 01:07:48,640
and movies or whatever like when mostly
 

2543
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:50,190
and movies or whatever like when mostly
animes I think they just have so many

2544
01:07:50,190 --> 01:07:50,200
animes I think they just have so many
 

2545
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:51,910
animes I think they just have so many
conversations with themselves alone and

2546
01:07:51,910 --> 01:07:51,920
conversations with themselves alone and
 

2547
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:53,750
conversations with themselves alone and
I'm like this is not realistic like

2548
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:53,760
I'm like this is not realistic like
 

2549
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:54,789
I'm like this is not realistic like
normally you would just think these

2550
01:07:54,789 --> 01:07:54,799
normally you would just think these
 

2551
01:07:54,799 --> 01:07:56,349
normally you would just think these
things to yourself like you can just

2552
01:07:56,349 --> 01:07:56,359
things to yourself like you can just
 

2553
01:07:56,359 --> 01:07:58,630
things to yourself like you can just
like like have them like give a little

2554
01:07:58,630 --> 01:07:58,640
like like have them like give a little
 

2555
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:00,789
like like have them like give a little
bit of a Reverb on the dialogue so that

2556
01:08:00,789 --> 01:08:00,799
bit of a Reverb on the dialogue so that
 

2557
01:08:00,799 --> 01:08:02,829
bit of a Reverb on the dialogue so that
it sounds like he's thinking or so

2558
01:08:02,829 --> 01:08:02,839
it sounds like he's thinking or so
 

2559
01:08:02,839 --> 01:08:05,470
it sounds like he's thinking or so
character yeah and they just always talk

2560
01:08:05,470 --> 01:08:05,480
character yeah and they just always talk
 

2561
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:07,829
character yeah and they just always talk
out loud but maybe those are the people

2562
01:08:07,829 --> 01:08:07,839
out loud but maybe those are the people
 

2563
01:08:07,839 --> 01:08:09,870
out loud but maybe those are the people
who can't think in their head exactly so

2564
01:08:09,870 --> 01:08:09,880
who can't think in their head exactly so
 

2565
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:12,510
who can't think in their head exactly so
all anime characters they just don't

2566
01:08:12,510 --> 01:08:12,520
all anime characters they just don't
 

2567
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:14,750
all anime characters they just don't
have internal dialogue yeah I could

2568
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:14,760
have internal dialogue yeah I could
 

2569
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:16,189
have internal dialogue yeah I could
believe it maybe anime characters they

2570
01:08:16,189 --> 01:08:16,199
believe it maybe anime characters they
 

2571
01:08:16,199 --> 01:08:17,669
believe it maybe anime characters they
just don't have that kind of brain I

2572
01:08:17,669 --> 01:08:17,679
just don't have that kind of brain I
 

2573
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:19,510
just don't have that kind of brain I
both of them should have internal

2574
01:08:19,510 --> 01:08:19,520
both of them should have internal
 

2575
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:21,470
both of them should have internal
dialogue if there's so many anime

2576
01:08:21,470 --> 01:08:21,480
dialogue if there's so many anime
 

2577
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:22,870
dialogue if there's so many anime
characters that don't have it I think

2578
01:08:22,870 --> 01:08:22,880

2579
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:25,910
characters that don't have it I think
that's a skill issue

2580

01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:28,510
that's a skill issue
