it seems like
um now

3324
01:27:34,450 --> 01:27:34,460
um now
 

3325
01:27:34,460 --> 01:27:40,010
um now
uh like there's a wall on the side of

3326
01:27:40,010 --> 01:27:40,020
uh like there's a wall on the side of

01:27:46,380 --> 01:27:48,229
arrows which will prevent them the one
word that I had which will prevent them

3332
01:27:48,229 --> 01:27:48,239

3333
01:27:48,239 --> 01:27:50,990
word that I had which will prevent them
from shooting me down like one half

3334
01:27:50,990 --> 01:27:51,000
from shooting me down like one half
 

3335
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,090
from shooting me down like one half
second before I land

3336
01:27:53,090 --> 01:27:53,100
second before I land
 

3337
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:55,669
second before I land
you know what I mean because in last

3338
01:27:55,669 --> 01:27:55,679
you know what I mean because in last
 

3339
01:27:55,679 --> 01:28:00,590
you know what I mean because in last
year menu Senpai shot akiroz a senpai in

3340
01:28:00,590 --> 01:28:00,600
year menu Senpai shot akiroz a senpai in
 

3341
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:02,649
year menu Senpai shot akiroz a senpai in
the very moment when she was Landing

3342
01:28:02,649 --> 01:28:02,659
the very moment when she was Landing
 

3343
01:28:02,659 --> 01:28:05,209
the very moment when she was Landing
which is obviously easier to shoot

3344
01:28:05,209 --> 01:28:05,219
which is obviously easier to shoot
 

3345
01:28:05,219 --> 01:28:08,149
which is obviously easier to shoot
because uh you you get slower as you try

3346
01:28:08,149 --> 01:28:08,159
because uh you you get slower as you try
 

3347
01:28:08,159 --> 01:28:11,510
because uh you you get slower as you try
to land properly right so that's the

3348
01:28:11,510 --> 01:28:11,520
to land properly right so that's the
 

3349
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:14,149
to land properly right so that's the
most dangerous area but this time they

3350
01:28:14,149 --> 01:28:14,159
most dangerous area but this time they
 

3351
01:28:14,159 --> 01:28:16,070
most dangerous area but this time they
added a glass wall so they can only

3352
01:28:16,070 --> 01:28:16,080
added a glass wall so they can only
 

3353
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:19,250
added a glass wall so they can only
shoot me when I'm still pretty high up

3354
01:28:19,250 --> 01:28:19,260
shoot me when I'm still pretty high up
 

3355
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:20,450
shoot me when I'm still pretty high up
in the air

3356
01:28:20,450 --> 01:28:20,460
in the air
 

3357
01:28:20,460 --> 01:28:24,169
in the air
and when I still have the most speed and

3358
01:28:24,169 --> 01:28:24,179
and when I still have the most speed and
 

3359
01:28:24,179 --> 01:28:27,229
and when I still have the most speed and
move around through those Hoops pretty

3360
01:28:27,229 --> 01:28:27,239
move around through those Hoops pretty
 

3361
01:28:27,239 --> 01:28:29,689

01:29:27,250 --> 01:29:27,260

 

3397
01:29:27,260 --> 01:29:29,870

but I really haven't had the experience

3398
01:29:29,870 --> 01:29:29,880
but I really haven't had the experience
 

3399
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:32,629
but I really haven't had the experience
of being shot while being in the air I

3400
01:29:32,629 --> 01:29:32,639
of being shot while being in the air I
 

3401
01:29:32,639 --> 01:29:34,250
of being shot while being in the air I
think it was fall down but you could

3402
01:29:34,250 --> 01:29:34,260
think it was fall down but you could
 

3403
01:29:34,260 --> 01:29:36,229
think it was fall down but you could
still save yourself no

3404
01:29:36,229 --> 01:29:36,239
still save yourself no
 

3405
01:29:36,239 --> 01:29:38,810
still save yourself no
if you are pretty high up in the air and

3406
01:29:38,810 --> 01:29:38,820
if you are pretty high up in the air and
 

3407
01:29:38,820 --> 01:29:42,110
if you are pretty high up in the air and
get shot I think you can still save

3408
01:29:42,110 --> 01:29:42,120
get shot I think you can still save
 

3409
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:44,629
get shot I think you can still save
yourself there might be a point penalty

3410
01:29:44,629 --> 01:29:44,639
yourself there might be a point penalty
 

3411
01:29:44,639 --> 01:29:48,110
yourself there might be a point penalty
penalty I guess yeah

3412
01:29:48,110 --> 01:29:48,120

 

3413
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:51,169

just don't die yeah
but but honestly like it's so fast I

3416
01:29:54,709 --> 01:29:54,719
but but honestly like it's so fast I
 

3417
01:29:54,719 --> 01:29:56,629
but but honestly like it's so fast I
don't think they really managed to I

3418
01:29:56,629 --> 01:29:56,639
don't think they really managed to I
 

3419
01:29:56,639 --> 01:29:57,950
don't think they really managed to I
mean I don't want to jinx it but it's

3420
01:29:57,950 --> 01:29:57,960
mean I don't want to jinx it but it's
 

3421
01:29:57,960 --> 01:29:59,750
mean I don't want to jinx it but it's
like really really difficult

3422
01:29:59,750 --> 01:29:59,760
like really really difficult
 

3423
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:01,610
like really really difficult
really difficult and you also got to

3424
01:30:01,610 --> 01:30:01,620
really difficult and you also got to
 

3425
01:30:01,620 --> 01:30:05,770
really difficult and you also got to
consider I guess a certain amount of lag

3426
01:30:05,770 --> 01:30:05,780
consider I guess a certain amount of lag
 

3427
01:30:05,780 --> 01:30:08,450
consider I guess a certain amount of lag
so they they actually don't have

3428
01:30:08,450 --> 01:30:08,460
so they they actually don't have
 

3429
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:12,050
so they they actually don't have
infinite uh ammo either they will be

3430
01:30:12,050 --> 01:30:12,060
infinite uh ammo either they will be
 

3431
01:30:12,060 --> 01:30:15,229
infinite uh ammo either they will be
shooting I think 10 arrows per person

3432
01:30:15,229 --> 01:30:15,239
shooting I think 10 arrows per person
 

3433
01:30:15,239 --> 01:30:17,990
shooting I think 10 arrows per person
and it will be

3434
01:30:17,990 --> 01:30:18,000
and it will be
 

3435
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,870
and it will be
uh since I'm in the white sea team I

3436
01:30:20,870 --> 01:30:20,880
uh since I'm in the white sea team I
 

3437
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:23,870
uh since I'm in the white sea team I
think the Red Sea team C team only which

3438
01:30:23,870 --> 01:30:23,880
think the Red Sea team C team only which
 

3439
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:26,450
think the Red Sea team C team only which
is like what six people or so they will

3440
01:30:26,450 --> 01:30:26,460
is like what six people or so they will
 

3441
01:30:26,460 --> 01:30:29,030
is like what six people or so they will
be shooting at me not the whole red team

3442
01:30:29,030 --> 01:30:29,040
be shooting at me not the whole red team
 

3443
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:32,209
be shooting at me not the whole red team
only the sea Team part of the red team

3444
01:30:32,209 --> 01:30:32,219
only the sea Team part of the red team
 

3445
01:30:32,219 --> 01:30:34,669
only the sea Team part of the red team
yeah so it's gonna be like six versus

3446
01:30:34,669 --> 01:30:34,679
yeah so it's gonna be like six versus
 

3447
01:30:34,679 --> 01:30:38,689
yeah so it's gonna be like six versus
one with ten arrows each

3448
01:30:38,689 --> 01:30:38,699
one with ten arrows each
 

3449
01:30:38,699 --> 01:30:43,970
one with ten arrows each
and I have free uh strength one

3450
01:30:43,970 --> 01:30:43,980
and I have free uh strength one
 

3451
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:47,330
and I have free uh strength one
um

3452
01:30:47,330 --> 01:30:47,340

3455
01:30:48,659 --> 01:30:51,010
fireworks
and so by the way

3456
01:30:51,010 --> 01:30:51,020
and so by the way
 

3457
01:30:51,020 --> 01:30:56,390
and so by the way
uh for every team there will be one

3458
01:30:56,390 --> 01:30:56,400
uh for every team there will be one
 

3459
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:57,830
uh for every team there will be one
um point of view that will be streamed

01:35:15,229 --> 01:35:15,239
you can see it by seeing if it's in the
 

3641

step on the pressure plate and like you
 

3669
01:35:45,719 --> 01:35:48,470
step on the pressure plate and like you
have to run over the pressure plate to

3670
01:35:48,470 --> 01:35:48,480
have to run over the pressure plate to
 

3671
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:51,169
have to run over the pressure plate to
be on the Piston right at the moment

3672
01:35:51,169 --> 01:35:51,179
be on the Piston right at the moment
 

3673
01:35:51,179 --> 01:35:53,270

from the white team free people from the
 

3687
01:36:07,139 --> 01:36:09,470
from the white team free people from the
red team trying to throw as many

02:41:07,220 --> 02:41:11,929
it's all right with that
I think also one reason why it wasn't uh

6056
02:41:11,929 --> 02:41:11,939
I think also one reason why it wasn't uh
 

6057
02:41:11,939 --> 02:41:13,910
I think also one reason why it wasn't uh
that scary to me anymore after a while

6058
02:41:13,910 --> 02:41:13,920
that scary to me anymore after a while
 

6059
02:41:13,920 --> 02:41:15,650
that scary to me anymore after a while
like in the beginning it was just

6060
02:41:15,650 --> 02:41:15,660
like in the beginning it was just
 

6061
02:41:15,660 --> 02:41:17,450
like in the beginning it was just
inevitable but later on I think because

6062
02:41:17,450 --> 02:41:17,460
inevitable but later on I think because
 

6063
02:41:17,460 --> 02:41:19,429
inevitable but later on I think because
my screen was so small I wasn't looking

6064
02:41:19,429 --> 02:41:19,439
my screen was so small I wasn't looking
 

6065
02:41:19,439 --> 02:41:21,950
my screen was so small I wasn't looking
at OBS but I was just the whole game

02:41:21,950 --> 02:41:21,960
at OBS but I was just the whole game
 

6067
02:41:21,960 --> 02:41:24,710

screen was windowed and fairly small on

02:41:24,710 --> 02:41:24,720

6069
02:41:24,720 --> 02:41:27,469

my screen and everything around the game

6070
02:41:27,469 --> 02:41:27,479

6071
02:41:27,479 --> 02:41:29,170
my screen and everything around the game
was really bright
