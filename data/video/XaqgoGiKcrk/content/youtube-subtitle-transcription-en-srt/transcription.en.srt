that's how she said it

4370
02:01:58,010 --> 02:01:58,020

 

4371
02:01:58,020 --> 02:02:00,709

yes I played 70 of the campaign I didn't

4372
02:02:00,709 --> 02:02:00,719
yes I played 70 of the campaign I didn't
 

4373
02:02:00,719 --> 02:02:02,390
yes I played 70 of the campaign I didn't
know

4374
02:02:02,390 --> 02:02:02,400
know
 

4375
02:02:02,400 --> 02:02:05,450
know
because there's even there was even like

4376
02:02:05,450 --> 02:02:05,460
because there's even there was even like
 

4377
02:02:05,460 --> 02:02:08,990
because there's even there was even like
this there was even a spot so empty in

4378
02:02:08,990 --> 02:02:09,000
this there was even a spot so empty in
 

4379
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,390
this there was even a spot so empty in
my weapon wheel they could have just put

4380
02:02:11,390 --> 02:02:11,400
my weapon wheel they could have just put
 

4381
02:02:11,400 --> 02:02:13,550
my weapon wheel they could have just put
it there so I thought as long as it's

4382
02:02:13,550 --> 02:02:13,560
it there so I thought as long as it's
 

4383
02:02:13,560 --> 02:02:14,870
it there so I thought as long as it's
not full

4384
02:02:14,870 --> 02:02:14,880
not full
 

4385
02:02:14,880 --> 02:02:17,330
not full
then anything new would be put into the

4386
02:02:17,330 --> 02:02:17,340
then anything new would be put into the
 

4387
02:02:17,340 --> 02:02:23,149
then anything new would be put into the
empty slot no that's like my logic

4388
02:02:23,149 --> 02:02:23,159

chances didn't mind it either but as I

4566
02:06:31,550 --> 02:06:31,560
chances didn't mind it either but as I
 

4567
02:06:31,560 --> 02:06:34,129
chances didn't mind it either but as I
explained in my last stream at the end I

4568
02:06:34,129 --> 02:06:34,139
explained in my last stream at the end I
 

4569
02:06:34,139 --> 02:06:36,050
explained in my last stream at the end I
had a little oopsie and I put her in and

4570
02:06:36,050 --> 02:06:36,060
had a little oopsie and I put her in and

4573
02:06:38,760 --> 02:06:41,089
then I I tried to turn the toilet off
and I thought that that this way would

4574
02:06:41,089 --> 02:06:41,099
and I thought that that this way would
 

4575
02:06:41,099 --> 02:06:43,129
and I thought that that this way would
be safe it wouldn't turn but the moment

4576
02:06:43,129 --> 02:06:43,139
be safe it wouldn't turn but the moment
 

4577
02:06:43,139 --> 02:06:45,649
be safe it wouldn't turn but the moment
you turn it off it does one last cycle

4578
02:06:45,649 --> 02:06:45,659
you turn it off it does one last cycle
 

4579
02:06:45,659 --> 02:06:47,390
you turn it off it does one last cycle
and turns around

4580
02:06:47,390 --> 02:06:47,400
and turns around
 

4581
02:06:47,400 --> 02:06:48,890
and turns around
so in case you don't know how it works

4582
02:06:48,890 --> 02:06:48,900
so in case you don't know how it works

it's like a round capsule kind of and
 

4591
02:06:58,980 --> 02:07:00,950
it's like a round capsule kind of and
inside is all around too and it looks a

4592
02:07:00,950 --> 02:07:00,960

02:07:08,450 --> 02:07:08,460
a cat is in there it like recognizes the
 

4599
02:07:08,460 --> 02:07:10,850
a cat is in there it like recognizes the
weight that it has more weight than

once it leaves it knows okay cat is done
so it will wait a little bit so that

4608
02:07:19,490 --> 02:07:19,500
so it will wait a little bit so that
 

4609
02:07:19,500 --> 02:07:21,350
so it will wait a little bit so that
whatever they did in there gets like

02:07:21,350 --> 02:07:21,360
whatever they did in there gets like
 

4611

03:10:01,859 --> 03:10:03,950
actually so I I was like I was grilling
them endlessly and at some point I

7200
03:10:03,950 --> 03:10:03,960
them endlessly and at some point I
 

7201
03:10:03,960 --> 03:10:06,290
them endlessly and at some point I
realized uh all right they're getting

7202
03:10:06,290 --> 03:10:06,300
realized uh all right they're getting
 

7203
03:10:06,300 --> 03:10:08,330

03:10:08,330 --> 03:10:08,340
like pretty dark now like outside
 

7205
03:10:08,340 --> 03:10:11,690
like pretty dark now like outside
they're like maximum at this point so I

7206
03:10:11,690 --> 03:10:11,700
they're like maximum at this point so I
 

7207
03:10:11,700 --> 03:10:15,050
they're like maximum at this point so I
cut them open to see what it looks like

7208
03:10:15,050 --> 03:10:15,060
cut them open to see what it looks like
 

7209
03:10:15,060 --> 03:10:17,269
cut them open to see what it looks like
inside and holy [\h__\h] when I cut them

7210
03:10:17,269 --> 03:10:17,279
inside and holy [\h__\h] when I cut them
 

7211
03:10:17,279 --> 03:10:22,429
inside and holy [\h__\h] when I cut them
open so much [\h__\h] meat juice spills

7212
03:10:22,429 --> 03:10:22,439
open so much [\h__\h] meat juice spills

10900
04:52:36,110 --> 04:52:36,120
yeah I I I asked putting to hide some
 

10901
04:52:36,120 --> 04:52:38,330
yeah I I I asked putting to hide some
previous couple talk participants in the

10902
04:52:38,330 --> 04:52:38,340
previous couple talk participants in the
 

10903
04:52:38,340 --> 04:52:41,570
previous couple talk participants in the
background but and I said you can make

10904
04:52:41,570 --> 04:52:41,580
background but and I said you can make
 

10905
04:52:41,580 --> 04:52:43,670
background but and I said you can make
them really small so that they won't be

10906
04:52:43,670 --> 04:52:43,680
them really small so that they won't be
 

10907
04:52:43,680 --> 04:52:45,590
them really small so that they won't be
too obvious but then pudding made them

10908
04:52:45,590 --> 04:52:45,600
too obvious but then pudding made them
 

10909
04:52:45,600 --> 04:52:49,190
too obvious but then pudding made them
so [\h__\h] tiny I guess like relatively

10910
04:52:49,190 --> 04:52:49,200
so [\h__\h] tiny I guess like relatively
 

10911
04:52:49,200 --> 04:52:51,890
so [\h__\h] tiny I guess like relatively
more or less realistically sized but not

10912
04:52:51,890 --> 04:52:51,900
more or less realistically sized but not
 

10913
04:52:51,900 --> 04:52:53,810
more or less realistically sized but not
really even then like on the top of a

10914
04:52:53,810 --> 04:52:53,820
really even then like on the top of a
 

10915
04:52:53,820 --> 04:52:56,690
really even then like on the top of a
[\h__\h] skyscraper

10916
04:52:56,690 --> 04:52:56,700
[\h__\h] skyscraper
 

10917
04:52:56,700 --> 04:52:59,570
[\h__\h] skyscraper
um I guess that was still too big if you

10918
04:52:59,570 --> 04:52:59,580
um I guess that was still too big if you
 

10919
04:52:59,580 --> 04:53:02,150
um I guess that was still too big if you
say look at this realistically but it's

10920
04:53:02,150 --> 04:53:02,160
say look at this realistically but it's
 

10921
04:53:02,160 --> 04:53:04,070
say look at this realistically but it's
really hard to notice so you guys gotta

10922
04:53:04,070 --> 04:53:04,080
really hard to notice so you guys gotta
 

10923
04:53:04,080 --> 04:53:06,948
really hard to notice so you guys gotta
watch there's not every previous whole

10924
04:53:06,948 --> 04:53:06,958
watch there's not every previous whole
 

10925
04:53:06,958 --> 04:53:09,350
watch there's not every previous whole
talk participant on there but quite a

10926
04:53:09,350 --> 04:53:09,360
talk participant on there but quite a
 

10927
04:53:09,360 --> 04:53:11,270
talk participant on there but quite a
lot I think like at least

10928
04:53:11,270 --> 04:53:11,280
lot I think like at least
 

10929
04:53:11,280 --> 04:53:14,390
lot I think like at least
10 to 15.

10930
04:53:14,390 --> 04:53:14,400
10 to 15.
 

10931
04:53:14,400 --> 04:53:18,230
10 to 15.
they are really tiny yeah and in some

10932
04:53:18,230 --> 04:53:18,240
they are really tiny yeah and in some
 

10933
04:53:18,240 --> 04:53:21,410

so awkward for Coco Senpai for some
 

11101
04:57:38,638 --> 04:57:39,890
so awkward for Coco Senpai for some
reason because it was still my original

11102
04:57:39,890 --> 04:57:39,900
reason because it was still my original
 

11103
04:57:39,900 --> 04:57:42,650
reason because it was still my original
format I guess translating from

11104
04:57:42,650 --> 04:57:42,660
format I guess translating from
 

11105
04:57:42,660 --> 04:57:45,170
format I guess translating from
uh Japanese to English but then we

11106
04:57:45,170 --> 04:57:45,180
uh Japanese to English but then we
 

11107
04:57:45,180 --> 04:57:46,550
uh Japanese to English but then we
switch it up and suddenly I feel so

11108
04:57:46,550 --> 04:57:46,560
switch it up and suddenly I feel so
 

11109
04:57:46,560 --> 04:57:49,190
switch it up and suddenly I feel so
awkward about it

11110
04:57:49,190 --> 04:57:49,200
awkward about it
 

11111
04:57:49,200 --> 04:57:51,110
awkward about it
um Kelly no Kelly I think still makes

11112
04:57:51,110 --> 04:57:51,120
um Kelly no Kelly I think still makes
 

11113
04:57:51,120 --> 04:57:53,990
um Kelly no Kelly I think still makes
sense because I'll be honest her

11114
04:57:53,990 --> 04:57:54,000
sense because I'll be honest her
 

11115
04:57:54,000 --> 04:57:56,150
sense because I'll be honest her
I think there's many many things that

11116
04:57:56,150 --> 04:57:56,160
I think there's many many things that
 

11117
04:57:56,160 --> 04:57:57,470
I think there's many many things that
she can say in English that she can't

11118
04:57:57,470 --> 04:57:57,480
she can say in English that she can't
 

11119
04:57:57,480 --> 04:57:59,150
she can say in English that she can't
say in Japanese so it still makes sense

11120
04:57:59,150 --> 04:57:59,160
say in Japanese so it still makes sense
 

11121
04:57:59,160 --> 04:58:01,910
say in Japanese so it still makes sense
in my opinion

11122
04:58:01,910 --> 04:58:01,920
in my opinion
 

11123
04:58:01,920 --> 04:58:04,730
in my opinion
um but yeah like Lisa for example if I

11124
04:58:04,730 --> 04:58:04,740
um but yeah like Lisa for example if I
 

11125
04:58:04,740 --> 04:58:06,350
um but yeah like Lisa for example if I
were to do an interview with me so I

11126
04:58:06,350 --> 04:58:06,360
were to do an interview with me so I
 

11127
04:58:06,360 --> 04:58:08,690
were to do an interview with me so I
think she also is like fluent in

11128
04:58:08,690 --> 04:58:08,700
think she also is like fluent in
 

11129
04:58:08,700 --> 04:58:12,530
think she also is like fluent in
Japanese so hmm But then if I say okay

04:58:12,540 --> 04:58:14,410
Japanese so hmm But then if I say okay
let's do it without translation then

11132
04:58:14,410 --> 04:58:14,420
let's do it without translation then
 

11133
04:58:14,420 --> 04:58:17,208
let's do it without translation then
kind of defeats the purpose of whole

11134
04:58:17,208 --> 04:58:17,218
kind of defeats the purpose of whole
 

11135
04:58:17,218 --> 04:58:19,070
kind of defeats the purpose of whole
talk you know

11136
04:58:19,070 --> 04:58:19,080
talk you know
 

11137
04:58:19,080 --> 04:58:23,208
talk you know
which I guess I can make an exception

11138
04:58:23,208 --> 04:58:23,218
which I guess I can make an exception
 

11139
04:58:23,218 --> 04:58:24,948
which I guess I can make an exception
but

11140
04:58:24,948 --> 04:58:24,958
but
 

11141
04:58:24,958 --> 04:58:26,990
but
I think I think Japanese people would be

11142
04:58:26,990 --> 04:58:27,000
I think I think Japanese people would be
 

11143
04:58:27,000 --> 04:58:28,850
I think I think Japanese people would be
happy about having the translation in

11144
04:58:28,850 --> 04:58:28,860
happy about having the translation in
 

11145
04:58:28,860 --> 04:58:31,368
happy about having the translation in
there but then I I maybe I'm

11146
04:58:31,368 --> 04:58:31,378
there but then I I maybe I'm
 

11147
04:58:31,378 --> 04:58:33,470
there but then I I maybe I'm
overthinking but I do feel awkward about

11148
04:58:33,470 --> 04:58:33,480
overthinking but I do feel awkward about
 

11149
04:58:33,480 --> 04:58:36,470
overthinking but I do feel awkward about
it just thinking about it thinking about

11150
04:58:36,470 --> 04:58:36,480
it just thinking about it thinking about
 

11151
04:58:36,480 --> 04:58:38,050
it just thinking about it thinking about
me sitting there

11152
04:58:38,050 --> 04:58:38,060
me sitting there
 

11153
04:58:38,060 --> 04:58:40,730
me sitting there

some cats just don't like this kind of

11520
05:07:57,110 --> 05:07:57,120
some cats just don't like this kind of
 

11521
05:07:57,120 --> 05:08:00,050
some cats just don't like this kind of
thing so much because it feels kind of

11522
05:08:00,050 --> 05:08:00,060
thing so much because it feels kind of
 

11523
05:08:00,060 --> 05:08:03,110
thing so much because it feels kind of
like there's no space in there it looks

11524
05:08:03,110 --> 05:08:03,120
like there's no space in there it looks
 

11525
05:08:03,120 --> 05:08:06,050
like there's no space in there it looks
huge from the outside but inside it's

11526
05:08:06,050 --> 05:08:06,060
huge from the outside but inside it's
 

11527
05:08:06,060 --> 05:08:13,070
huge from the outside but inside it's
pretty what's the word

11528
05:08:13,070 --> 05:08:13,080

 

11529
05:08:13,080 --> 05:08:16,070

not Spacey

11530
05:08:16,070 --> 05:08:16,080
not Spacey
 

11531
05:08:16,080 --> 05:08:18,530
not Spacey
so a cramped yeah that might be a little

11532
05:08:18,530 --> 05:08:18,540
so a cramped yeah that might be a little
 

11533
05:08:18,540 --> 05:08:19,368
so a cramped yeah that might be a little
bit

11534
05:08:19,368 --> 05:08:19,378
bit
 

11535
05:08:19,378 --> 05:08:22,368
bit
intimidating and uncomfortable for

11536
05:08:22,368 --> 05:08:22,378
intimidating and uncomfortable for
 

11537
05:08:22,378 --> 05:08:24,830
intimidating and uncomfortable for
some cats

11538
05:08:24,830 --> 05:08:24,840
some cats
 

11539
05:08:24,840 --> 05:08:25,970
some cats
yeah

11540
05:08:25,970 --> 05:08:25,980
yeah
 

11541
05:08:25,980 --> 05:08:32,750
yeah
yeah but besides that

11542
05:08:32,750 --> 05:08:32,760

 

11543
05:08:32,760 --> 05:08:35,270

some cats if they're used to like having

11544
05:08:35,270 --> 05:08:35,280
some cats if they're used to like having
 

11545
05:08:35,280 --> 05:08:38,330
some cats if they're used to like having
an open Toilet you know with no top

11546
05:08:38,330 --> 05:08:38,340
an open Toilet you know with no top
 

11547
05:08:38,340 --> 05:08:43,368
an open Toilet you know with no top
then this might also be

11548
05:08:43,368 --> 05:08:43,378

 

11549
05:08:43,378 --> 05:08:47,390

a reason why they don't like it

11550
05:08:47,390 --> 05:08:47,400

 

11551
05:08:47,400 --> 05:08:49,550

but I'm so glad mine like it you're

11552
05:08:49,550 --> 05:08:49,560
but I'm so glad mine like it you're
 

11553
05:08:49,560 --> 05:08:51,430
but I'm so glad mine like it you're
really making me want to buy one myself

11554
05:08:51,430 --> 05:08:51,440
really making me want to buy one myself
 

11555
05:08:51,440 --> 05:08:53,990
really making me want to buy one myself
it's expensive but I think it's worth

11556
05:08:53,990 --> 05:08:54,000
it's expensive but I think it's worth
 

11557
05:08:54,000 --> 05:08:55,430
it's expensive but I think it's worth
the money

11558
05:08:55,430 --> 05:08:55,440
the money
 

11559
05:08:55,440 --> 05:09:00,410
the money
I feel like it also saves cat litter

11560
05:09:00,410 --> 05:09:00,420

 

11561
05:09:00,420 --> 05:09:02,868

I feel like it does save on cat litter

11562
05:09:02,868 --> 05:09:02,878
I feel like it does save on cat litter
 

11563
05:09:02,878 --> 05:09:08,150
I feel like it does save on cat litter
and uh on time and Sanity and also it's

11564
05:09:08,150 --> 05:09:08,160
and uh on time and Sanity and also it's
 

11565
05:09:08,160 --> 05:09:11,810
and uh on time and Sanity and also it's
not stinky at all the the smell gets way

11566
05:09:11,810 --> 05:09:11,820
not stinky at all the the smell gets way
 

11567
05:09:11,820 --> 05:09:14,208

11583
05:09:30,000 --> 05:09:33,948
how about a ton of soft stuff I saw a
test on that uh when you know that your

11584
05:09:33,948 --> 05:09:33,958

11587
05:09:37,620 --> 05:09:40,490
cat has like diarrhea or so you should
just turn the timer uh to like 15

11588

minutes or so
 

11591
05:09:42,180 --> 05:09:45,650
minutes or so
then it has more time to

11592
05:09:45,650 --> 05:09:45,660
then it has more time to
 

11593
05:09:45,660 --> 05:09:46,788
