yeah
although i mean i mean i it kind of

4976
03:40:19,670 --> 03:40:19,680
although i mean i mean i it kind of
 

4977
03:40:19,680 --> 03:40:22,229
although i mean i mean i it kind of
already exists because like with a big

4978
03:40:22,229 --> 03:40:22,239
already exists because like with a big
 

4979
03:40:22,239 --> 03:40:24,550
already exists because like with a big
ass venue like that

4980
03:40:24,550 --> 03:40:24,560
ass venue like that
 

4981
03:40:24,560 --> 03:40:25,830
ass venue like that
you

4982
03:40:25,830 --> 03:40:25,840
you
 

4983
03:40:25,840 --> 03:40:28,309
you
gotta you know build

4984
03:40:28,309 --> 03:40:28,319
gotta you know build
 

4985
03:40:28,319 --> 03:40:29,110
gotta you know build
[\h__\h]

4986
03:40:29,110 --> 03:40:29,120
[\h__\h]
 

4987
03:40:29,120 --> 03:40:32,150
[\h__\h]
you know so it's obviously like in

4988
03:40:32,150 --> 03:40:32,160
you know so it's obviously like in
 

4989
03:40:32,160 --> 03:40:33,269
you know so it's obviously like in
theory

4990
03:40:33,269 --> 03:40:33,279
theory
 

4991
03:40:33,279 --> 03:40:35,750
theory
you could go there

4992
03:40:35,750 --> 03:40:35,760
you could go there
 

4993
03:40:35,760 --> 03:40:39,030
you could go there
probably at least in the evening before

4994
03:40:39,030 --> 03:40:39,040
probably at least in the evening before
 

4995
03:40:39,040 --> 03:40:42,550
probably at least in the evening before
realistically speaking

4996
03:40:42,550 --> 03:40:42,560

 

4997
03:40:42,560 --> 03:40:43,990

yeah

4998
03:40:43,990 --> 03:40:44,000
yeah
 

4999
03:40:44,000 --> 03:40:45,590
yeah
i mean i'm sure there's some people who

5000
03:40:45,590 --> 03:40:45,600
i mean i'm sure there's some people who
 

5001
03:40:45,600 --> 03:40:47,590
i mean i'm sure there's some people who
check out the venue

5002
03:40:47,590 --> 03:40:47,600
check out the venue
 

5003
03:40:47,600 --> 03:40:49,110
check out the venue
the day before because otherwise it

5004
03:40:49,110 --> 03:40:49,120
the day before because otherwise it
 

5005
03:40:49,120 --> 03:40:50,550
the day before because otherwise it
would be chaotic and everything would go

5006
03:40:50,550 --> 03:40:50,560
would be chaotic and everything would go
 

5007
03:40:50,560 --> 03:40:53,830
would be chaotic and everything would go
wrong

5008
03:40:53,830 --> 03:40:53,840

 

5009
03:40:53,840 --> 03:40:56,710

yeah

5010
03:40:56,710 --> 03:40:56,720

 

5011
03:40:56,720 --> 03:40:59,110

hopefully hopefully

5012
03:40:59,110 --> 03:40:59,120
hopefully hopefully
 

5013
03:40:59,120 --> 03:41:00,070
hopefully hopefully
uh

5014
03:41:00,070 --> 03:41:00,080
uh
 

5015
03:41:00,080 --> 03:41:02,070
uh
assuming that we have a concert like

03:41:02,070 --> 03:41:02,080
assuming that we have a concert like
 

5017
03:41:02,080 --> 03:41:04,870
assuming that we have a concert like
this every year hopefully

5018
03:41:04,870 --> 03:41:04,880
this every year hopefully
 

5019
03:41:04,880 --> 03:41:07,110
this every year hopefully
by the time it happens again

5020
