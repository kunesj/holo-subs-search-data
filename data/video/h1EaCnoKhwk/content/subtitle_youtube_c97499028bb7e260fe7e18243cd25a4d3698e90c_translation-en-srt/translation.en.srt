Minecraft, but I'm going to hunt for treasure.  I was

1756
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:11,210

looking for something in Minecraft.

1757
01:08:11,210 --> 01:08:12,529

1759
01:08:12,539 --> 01:08:16,249

On the map, it said there was a treasure on a small island,

01:08:16,249 --> 01:08:16,259
On the map, it said there was a treasure on a small island,

but
 

1763
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:21,349
but
while I was looking for it, I was digging and the entire island disappeared.  It

1764
01:08:21,349 --> 01:08:21,359
while I was looking for it, I was digging and the entire island disappeared.  It
 

1765
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:24,050
while I was looking for it, I was digging and the entire island disappeared.  It
looks like most of it was erased, so I used it

1766
01:08:24,050 --> 01:08:24,060
looks like most of it was erased, so I used it
 

1767
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:27,349
looks like most of it was erased, so I used it
in a drawer for a while in the sorting room.They said they were going to

1779
01:08:46,380 --> 01:08:49,070

1781
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:52,910
but then I realized how Mako's
island was erased in the first place, but

1782
01:08:52,910 --> 01:08:52,920
island was erased in the first place, but
 

1783
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:55,910
island was erased in the first place, but
since then, I've said the word "sort it out" several times.  I
