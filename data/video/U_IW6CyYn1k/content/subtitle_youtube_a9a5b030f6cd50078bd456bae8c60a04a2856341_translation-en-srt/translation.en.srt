00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:54,789
I can barely see the minimap.
It's a bit interesting, isn't it?

2236
00:55:54,789 --> 00:55:54,799

 

2237
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:57,910

It's true that the eel is hiding behind the flames.

2238
00:55:57,910 --> 00:55:57,920

 

2239
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:01,030

2247
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,510

Maybe this is really bad

2248
00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:13,520

 

2249
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:16,630

This looks a little unsettling

2250
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:16,640

 

2251

04:22:14,769 --> 04:22:14,779

 

8385
04:22:14,779 --> 04:22:18,130

It's frustrating

8386
04:22:18,130 --> 04:22:18,140

 

8387
04:22:18,140 --> 04:22:21,490

It's frustrating

8388
04:22:21,490 --> 04:22:21,500

 

8389
04:22:21,500 --> 04:22:24,849

that

8390
04:22:24,849 --> 04:22:24,859

 

8391
04:22:24,859 --> 04:22:28,210

over there

8392
04:22:28,210 --> 04:22:28,220

 

8393
04:22:28,220 --> 04:22:29,210

Mushroom on that Teresa

8394
04:22:29,210 --> 04:22:29,220
Mushroom on that Teresa
 

8395
04:22:29,220 --> 04:22:37,809
Mushroom on that Teresa
Did someone take the mushroom because you said it wasn't taken?

8396
04:22:37,809 --> 04:22:37,819

 

8397
04:22:37,819 --> 04:22:41,110

But what exactly is it?

8398
04:22:41,110 --> 04:22:41,120

 

8399
04:22:41,120 --> 04:22:44,410

With that luck as well

8400
04:22:44,410 --> 04:22:44,420

 

8401
04:22:44,420 --> 04:22:47,710

After all, you have to rely on your luck.

8402
04:22:47,710 --> 04:22:47,720

 

8403
04:22:47,720 --> 04:22:51,010

I thought Okayu-chan was really strong in the beginning because she covered it well.

8404
04:22:51,010 --> 04:22:51,020

 

8405
04:22:51,020 --> 04:22:54,309

Picked up last time

8406
04:22:54,309 --> 04:22:54,319

 

8407
04:22:54,319 --> 04:22:57,610

I think it came in 4th place.

8408
04:22:57,610 --> 04:22:57,620

 

8409
04:22:57,620 --> 04:23:00,910

I'm sure from there

8410
04:23:00,910 --> 04:23:00,920

 

8411
04:23:00,920 --> 04:23:04,210

I hope you clear up your insults.

8412
04:23:04,210 --> 04:23:04,220

 

8413
04:23:04,220 --> 04:23:07,510

I think he came

8414
04:23:07,510 --> 04:23:07,520

 

8415
04:23:07,520 --> 04:23:10,809

I'm thinking

8416
04:23:10,809 --> 04:23:10,819

 

8417
04:23:10,819 --> 04:23:14,110

Then I'll try harder next time

8418
04:23:14,110 --> 04:23:14,120

 

8419
04:23:14,120 --> 04:23:17,410

Good luck and become champion again

8420
04:23:17,410 --> 04:23:17,420

 

8421
04:23:17,420 --> 04:23:20,710

I want to get it back

8422
04:23:20,710 --> 04:23:20,720

 

8423
04:23:20,720 --> 04:23:24,010

yes

8424
04:23:24,010 --> 04:23:24,020

 

8425
04:23:24,020 --> 04:23:25,500

thank you

8426
04:23:25,500 --> 04:23:25,510

The rice porridge that rose to 74th place is now 2022.

8444

Thank you for being number 1

8452
04:24:02,290 --> 04:24:02,300

 

8453
04:24:02,300 --> 04:24:05,590

Apparently not

8454
04:24:05,590 --> 04:24:05,600

 

8455
04:24:05,600 --> 04:24:08,889

No, it's quite like this

8456
04:24:08,889 --> 04:24:08,899

 

8457
04:24:08,899 --> 04:24:12,189

During the performance, I was able to run as usual, and when I wondered why, before the performance,

8458
04:24:12,189 --> 04:24:12,199

 

8459
04:24:12,199 --> 04:24:15,490

Mess with Subaru-chan

8460
04:24:15,490 --> 04:24:15,500

 

8461
04:24:15,500 --> 04:24:18,790

We run together every day, every course.

8462
04:24:18,790 --> 04:24:18,800

 

8463
04:24:18,800 --> 04:24:22,090

That's what I was talking about, that's what I was talking about at this time.

8464
04:24:22,090 --> 04:24:22,100

 

8465
04:24:22,100 --> 04:24:25,389

As I was thinking about this, I was able to run as usual.

8466
04:24:25,389 --> 04:24:25,399

 

8467
04:24:25,399 --> 04:24:26,389

Only for me

8468
04:24:26,389 --> 04:24:26,399

I thought it wasn't a victory.

Maybe, but it's not like that anymore.
Because I didn't go that far

8502
04:25:07,330 --> 04:25:07,340
Because I didn't go that far
 

8503
04:25:07,340 --> 04:25:09,130

As expected, I couldn't see it for a while.

I thought so
 

8543
04:25:45,920 --> 04:25:47,950
I thought so
Eh, I'm kind of considerate.
