you said chances I went the opposite way
 

1355
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,010
you said chances I went the opposite way
maybe opposite way I went behind oh

maybe opposite way I went behind oh
 

1357
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:17,210
maybe opposite way I went behind oh
there's no way like five years ago

1358
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:17,220

 

1359
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:22,609

let me make one of those was that not
 

1373
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,650
let me make one of those was that not
supposed to say Polo uh you need Blaze

1374
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:42,660
supposed to say Polo uh you need Blaze
 

1375

supposed to say Polo uh you need Blaze
words yeah

1376

1377
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,250

our eyes as well uh we're supposed to be

1378
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:49,260
our eyes as well uh we're supposed to be
 

1379
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,810
our eyes as well uh we're supposed to be
scared that you're supposed to do it in

1380
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:50,820
scared that you're supposed to do it in
 

1381
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:54,349
scared that you're supposed to do it in
the other for some reason it's another I

1382
00:36:54,349 --> 00:36:54,359
the other for some reason it's another I
 

1383
00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:55,849
the other for some reason it's another I
don't know I don't know that's what I

1384
00:36:55,849 --> 00:36:55,859
don't know I don't know that's what I
 

1385
00:36:55,859 --> 00:36:57,349
don't know I don't know that's what I
thought I didn't know I don't know no

1386
00:36:57,349 --> 00:36:57,359
thought I didn't know I don't know no
 

1387
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:03,010
thought I didn't know I don't know no
you can do it anywhere

1388
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:03,020

 

1389
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:08,170

I don't think we'll find it

1390
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:08,180

 

1391
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:11,810

despawn in like five minutes probably is

1392
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:11,820
despawn in like five minutes probably is
 

1393
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,490
despawn in like five minutes probably is
there a radius like if we know a block

1394
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:13,500
there a radius like if we know a block
 

1395
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,829
there a radius like if we know a block
radius then we can do like a you know a

1396
00:37:15,829 --> 00:37:15,839
radius then we can do like a you know a
 

1397
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:21,290
radius then we can do like a you know a
circular sweep yeah I think there is but

1398
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:21,300
circular sweep yeah I think there is but
 

1399
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,109
circular sweep yeah I think there is but
all right let's go the other way blocks

1400
00:37:24,109 --> 00:37:24,119
all right let's go the other way blocks
 

1401
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:25,790
all right let's go the other way blocks
so we can calculate from where you know

1402
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:25,800
so we can calculate from where you know
 

1403
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,370
so we can calculate from where you know
through it and then we can set up maybe

1404
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:28,380
through it and then we can set up maybe
 

1405
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:31,250
through it and then we can set up maybe
okay maybe throw another one it didn't

1406
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:31,260
okay maybe throw another one it didn't
 

1407
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,930
okay maybe throw another one it didn't
go that far because it pinged really

1408
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:32,940
go that far because it pinged really
 

1409
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:35,210
go that far because it pinged really
quickly

1410
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:35,220
quickly
 

1411
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:38,390
quickly
okay it says 10 to 15 blocks okay so

1412
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:38,400
okay it says 10 to 15 blocks okay so
 

1413
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,190
okay it says 10 to 15 blocks okay so
let's go back to the original one and

1414
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:40,200
let's go back to the original one and
 

1415
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,329
let's go back to the original one and
then search

1416
00:37:41,329 --> 00:37:41,339
then search
 

1417
00:37:41,339 --> 00:37:43,609
then search
10 to 15 blocks away from the corner

1418
00:37:43,609 --> 00:37:43,619
10 to 15 blocks away from the corner
 

1419
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:45,530
10 to 15 blocks away from the corner
that you know threw it okay that is so

1420
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:45,540
that you know threw it okay that is so
 

1421
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,609
that you know threw it okay that is so
close

1422
00:37:46,609 --> 00:37:46,619
close
 

1423
00:37:46,619 --> 00:37:49,510
close
yeah that is pretty close

1424
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:49,520
yeah that is pretty close
 

1425
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,430
yeah that is pretty close
I'm sure we're just missing it

1426
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:52,440
I'm sure we're just missing it
 

1427
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,550
I'm sure we're just missing it
it could have broken apparently yeah uh

1428
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:55,560
it could have broken apparently yeah uh
 

1429
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,230
it could have broken apparently yeah uh
yeah that's true they break sometimes

1430
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:57,240
yeah that's true they break sometimes
 

1431
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:00,170
yeah that's true they break sometimes
right away I was it probably this is

1432
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:00,180
right away I was it probably this is
 

1433
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,870
right away I was it probably this is
probably broken

1434
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:02,880
probably broken
 

1435
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,849
probably broken
okay I'm gonna group up and throw

1436
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:04,859
okay I'm gonna group up and throw
 

1437
00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:09,130
okay I'm gonna group up and throw
another one everyone

1438
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:09,140

disappeared behind are we all using
 

1467
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,290
disappeared behind are we all using
shaders yeah somebody says it went down

1468
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:53,300
shaders yeah somebody says it went down
 

1469
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:56,810
shaders yeah somebody says it went down
but I I checked in the KFC though I mean

1470
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:56,820
but I I checked in the KFC though I mean

1473
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,790
the Kiara's house I wonder if it is a
shaders thing what they found

1474
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:01,800
shaders thing what they found
 

1475
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,310
shaders thing what they found
no I turned off shaders

1476
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:04,320
no I turned off shaders
 

1477
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,130
no I turned off shaders
uh are we right above it

1478
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:07,140
uh are we right above it
 

1479
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:11,089
uh are we right above it
no way there's no way no way

1480
00:39:11,089 --> 00:39:11,099
no way there's no way no way
 

1481
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:13,250
no way there's no way no way
and we then we would have probably like

1482
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:13,260
and we then we would have probably like
 

1483
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:16,970
and we then we would have probably like
dug into it yeah Amelia's underground

1484
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:16,980
dug into it yeah Amelia's underground
 

1485
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,430
dug into it yeah Amelia's underground
Subway cave turns way further that way

1486
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:19,440
Subway cave turns way further that way
 

1487
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,589
Subway cave turns way further that way
like to the left but maybe we should dig

1488
00:39:21,589 --> 00:39:21,599
like to the left but maybe we should dig
 

1489
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:22,910
like to the left but maybe we should dig
straight down from where you're throwing

1490
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:22,920
straight down from where you're throwing
 

1491
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,810
straight down from where you're throwing
it in Kiara's house yeah

1492
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:25,820
it in Kiara's house yeah

1503
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,829
somebody says oh it's not a good idea
it's not a good idea before we waste all

1504
00:39:45,829 --> 00:39:45,839
it's not a good idea before we waste all
 

1505
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:48,290
it's not a good idea before we waste all
the pearls though should we there's no

1506
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:48,300
the pearls though should we there's no
 

1507
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,630
the pearls though should we there's no
there's not here all right let's see I

1508
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:50,640
there's not here all right let's see I
 

1509
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,670
there's not here all right let's see I
have one too wait throw it somewhere

1510
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:52,680
have one too wait throw it somewhere
 

1511
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,170
have one too wait throw it somewhere
else where we should try throwing it

1512
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:54,180
else where we should try throwing it
 

1513
