oh of course the book is cheap because I
 

215
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:51,829
oh of course the book is cheap because I
don't know I I grind I grind that for

216
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:51,839

 

217
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,550

actually not finished yet because I
 

223
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,310
actually not finished yet because I
couldn't I couldn't find um efficiency 5

224
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:04,320

with a very cheap one I got several

226
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:07,760
with a very cheap one I got several
 

227
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:14,030
with a very cheap one I got several
efficiency 5 but it's like 50 50 64 so I

228
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:14,040
efficiency 5 but it's like 50 50 64 so I
 

229
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,910
efficiency 5 but it's like 50 50 64 so I
still don't really have one yet and when

230
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:17,920
still don't really have one yet and when
 

231
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,310
still don't really have one yet and when
I when I found like the cheaper one I

232
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:21,320
I when I found like the cheaper one I
 

233
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,710
I when I found like the cheaper one I
just killed the the first

already I only need uh efficiency five

264
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:13,760
already I only need uh efficiency five
 

265
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,389

7593
05:34:41,440 --> 05:34:45,670
first day right so yeah what happened
was that I think she got pushed down and

7594
05:34:45,670 --> 05:34:45,680
was that I think she got pushed down and
 

7595
05:34:45,680 --> 05:34:47,110
was that I think she got pushed down and
cuz there was a lot of people but I

7596
05:34:47,110 --> 05:34:47,120
cuz there was a lot of people but I
 

7597
05:34:47,120 --> 05:34:49,110
cuz there was a lot of people but I
think if there's only two of you guys it

7598
05:34:49,110 --> 05:34:49,120
think if there's only two of you guys it
 

7599
05:34:49,120 --> 05:34:50,470
think if there's only two of you guys it
should be

7600
05:34:50,470 --> 05:34:50,480
should be
 

7601
05:34:50,480 --> 05:34:52,670
should be
easier is what I think yeah and if she

7602
05:34:52,670 --> 05:34:52,680
easier is what I think yeah and if she
 

7603
05:34:52,680 --> 05:34:54,670
easier is what I think yeah and if she
dies she canot revive Again by the way
