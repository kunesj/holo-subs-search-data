5045
02:24:53,340 --> 02:24:56,510
rabbits well but he was already like 17
years old and he was consuming

5046
02:24:56,510 --> 02:24:56,520
years old and he was consuming
 

5047
02:24:56,520 --> 02:24:59,929
years old and he was consuming
everything in a mushed smoothie form so

5048
02:24:59,929 --> 02:24:59,939
everything in a mushed smoothie form so
 

5049
02:24:59,939 --> 02:25:01,969
everything in a mushed smoothie form so
I think the reason he was consuming that

5050
02:25:01,969 --> 02:25:01,979
I think the reason he was consuming that
 

5051
02:25:01,979 --> 02:25:04,190
I think the reason he was consuming that
was partially because he can't really

02:25:04,190 --> 02:25:04,200
was partially because he can't really
