9181
03:49:50,720 --> 03:49:53,189
made it my way through here pretty
smoothly

9182
03:49:53,189 --> 03:49:53,199
smoothly
 

9183
03:49:53,199 --> 03:49:55,510
smoothly
yeah

9184
03:49:55,510 --> 03:49:55,520

 

9185
03:49:55,520 --> 03:49:58,870

uh and now we have these things here hmm

9186
03:49:58,870 --> 03:49:58,880
uh and now we have these things here hmm
 

9187
03:49:58,880 --> 03:50:00,950
uh and now we have these things here hmm
can we kill them

9188
03:50:00,950 --> 03:50:00,960
can we kill them
 

9189
03:50:00,960 --> 03:50:04,710
can we kill them
or can we move them

9190
03:50:04,710 --> 03:50:04,720

 

9191
03:50:04,720 --> 03:50:07,590

oh okay we can easy

9192
03:50:07,590 --> 03:50:07,600
oh okay we can easy
 

9193
03:50:07,600 --> 03:50:08,630
oh okay we can easy
wow

9194
03:50:08,630 --> 03:50:08,640
wow
 

9195
03:50:08,640 --> 03:50:10,870
wow
okay now we see what happens if we were

9196
03:50:10,870 --> 03:50:10,880
okay now we see what happens if we were
 

9197
03:50:10,880 --> 03:50:12,870
okay now we see what happens if we were
to walk into one of those which we don't

9198
03:50:12,870 --> 03:50:12,880
to walk into one of those which we don't
 

9199
03:50:12,880 --> 03:50:15,189
to walk into one of those which we don't
want to do right

9200
03:50:15,189 --> 03:50:15,199
want to do right
 

9201
03:50:15,199 --> 03:50:20,070
want to do right
so very carefully

9202
03:50:20,070 --> 03:50:20,080

 

9203
03:50:20,080 --> 03:50:22,309

ah we could just throw a bomb in there

9204
03:50:22,309 --> 03:50:22,319
ah we could just throw a bomb in there
 

9205
03:50:22,319 --> 03:50:24,550
ah we could just throw a bomb in there
probably

9206
03:50:24,550 --> 03:50:24,560
probably
 

9207
03:50:24,560 --> 03:50:27,189
probably
to make it really easy but is that

9208
03:50:27,189 --> 03:50:27,199
to make it really easy but is that
 

9209
03:50:27,199 --> 03:50:29,189
to make it really easy but is that
necessary it shouldn't be necessary what

9210
03:50:29,189 --> 03:50:29,199
necessary it shouldn't be necessary what
 

9211
03:50:29,199 --> 03:50:33,269
necessary it shouldn't be necessary what
if you don't have any bumps

9212
03:50:33,269 --> 03:50:33,279

 

9213
03:50:33,279 --> 03:50:43,110

oh yeah we can do that

9214
03:50:43,110 --> 03:50:43,120

 

9215
03:50:43,120 --> 03:50:44,950

but they roll pretty far it's hard to

9216
03:50:44,950 --> 03:50:44,960
but they roll pretty far it's hard to
 

9217
03:50:44,960 --> 03:50:49,750
but they roll pretty far it's hard to
test it but

9218
03:50:49,750 --> 03:50:49,760

 

9219
03:50:49,760 --> 03:50:52,870

oh yeah okay

9220
03:50:52,870 --> 03:50:52,880

 

9221
03:50:52,880 --> 03:50:55,269

they're gone

9222
03:50:55,269 --> 03:50:55,279
they're gone
 

9223
03:50:55,279 --> 03:50:57,429
they're gone
now we have a free field to find this

9224
03:50:57,429 --> 03:50:57,439
now we have a free field to find this
 

9225
03:50:57,439 --> 03:51:00,830
now we have a free field to find this
thing oh he's pretty strong

9226
03:51:00,830 --> 03:51:00,840

 

9227
03:51:00,840 --> 03:51:03,510

[Applause]
 

9233
03:51:09,520 --> 03:51:11,750
[Applause]
i was just realizing that that's not one

9234
03:51:11,750 --> 03:51:11,760
i was just realizing that that's not one
 

9235
03:51:11,760 --> 03:51:14,710
i was just realizing that that's not one
of the normal skeletons it's stronger

9236
03:51:14,710 --> 03:51:14,720
of the normal skeletons it's stronger
 

9237
03:51:14,720 --> 03:51:16,710
of the normal skeletons it's stronger
but it was kind of too late where the

9238
03:51:16,710 --> 03:51:16,720
but it was kind of too late where the
 

9239
03:51:16,720 --> 03:51:20,630
but it was kind of too late where the
[\h__\h] did i go to reach that place

9240
03:51:20,630 --> 03:51:20,640
[\h__\h] did i go to reach that place
 

9241
03:51:20,640 --> 03:51:23,910
[\h__\h] did i go to reach that place
uh

9242
03:51:23,910 --> 03:51:23,920

 

9243
03:51:23,920 --> 03:51:29,030

look was it that way really

9244
03:51:29,030 --> 03:51:29,040

 

9245
03:51:29,040 --> 03:51:32,710

it's open now but no we have to go up

9246
03:51:32,710 --> 03:51:32,720
it's open now but no we have to go up
 

9247
03:51:32,720 --> 03:51:35,429
it's open now but no we have to go up
i guess

9248
03:51:35,429 --> 03:51:35,439

 

9249
03:51:35,439 --> 03:51:36,630

ah

9250
03:51:36,630 --> 03:51:36,640
ah
 

9251
03:51:36,640 --> 03:51:39,830
ah
could i have used maybe and maybe the

9252
03:51:39,830 --> 03:51:39,840
could i have used maybe and maybe the
 

9253
03:51:39,840 --> 03:51:43,990
could i have used maybe and maybe the
maybe the turrets would have killed him

9254
03:51:43,990 --> 03:51:44,000
maybe the turrets would have killed him
 

9255
03:51:44,000 --> 03:51:46,389
maybe the turrets would have killed him
if i but you have to get really close to

9256
03:51:46,389 --> 03:51:46,399
if i but you have to get really close to
 

9257
03:51:46,399 --> 03:51:49,429
if i but you have to get really close to
them to make them walk towards you

9258
03:51:49,429 --> 03:51:49,439
them to make them walk towards you
 

9259
03:51:49,439 --> 03:51:51,269
them to make them walk towards you
so i'm not too sure about that but now

9260
03:51:51,269 --> 03:51:51,279
so i'm not too sure about that but now
 

9261
03:51:51,279 --> 03:51:53,269
so i'm not too sure about that but now
we have to do the whole dungeon again

9262
03:51:53,269 --> 03:51:53,279
we have to do the whole dungeon again
 

9263

also use it in 3d if i wanted to
 

11711
04:47:55,600 --> 04:47:56,948
also use it in 3d if i wanted to
if i ever

11712
04:47:56,948 --> 04:47:56,958

example
 

11717
04:48:01,600 --> 04:48:04,788
example
yeah which will not be the norm though

11718
04:48:04,788 --> 04:48:04,798
yeah which will not be the norm though
 

11719
04:48:04,798 --> 04:48:06,708
yeah which will not be the norm though
because it's just easier for me to

11720
04:48:06,708 --> 04:48:06,718
because it's just easier for me to
 

11721
04:48:06,718 --> 04:48:09,350
because it's just easier for me to
control everything and translate

11722
04:48:09,350 --> 04:48:09,360
control everything and translate
 

11723
04:48:09,360 --> 04:48:12,150

12763
05:13:46,958 --> 05:13:49,030
oldest to to newest so i was thinking of
making a new playlist where

12764
05:13:49,030 --> 05:13:49,040
making a new playlist where
 

12765
05:13:49,040 --> 05:13:51,590
making a new playlist where

i guess

12770
05:13:55,350 --> 05:13:55,360
i guess
 

12771
05:13:55,360 --> 05:13:57,670
i guess
but it's not gonna

12772
05:13:57,670 --> 05:13:57,680
but it's not gonna
 

12773
05:13:57,680 --> 05:14:01,910
but it's not gonna
create any miracles

12774
05:14:01,910 --> 05:14:01,920
