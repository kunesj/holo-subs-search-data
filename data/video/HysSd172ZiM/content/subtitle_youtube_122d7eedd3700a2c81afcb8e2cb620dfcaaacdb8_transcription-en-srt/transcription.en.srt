when we all came here we signed an

02:05:04,669 --> 02:05:04,679
when we all came here we signed an
 

4373
02:05:04,679 --> 02:05:07,189

know they're not working as Pilots
 

4459
02:06:51,840 --> 02:06:53,570
know they're not working as Pilots
anymore but they used to before then if

anymore but they used to before then if
 

4461
02:06:53,580 --> 02:06:55,729
anymore but they used to before then if
they rewind something then that makes it

4462
02:06:55,729 --> 02:06:55,739
they rewind something then that makes it
 

4463
02:06:55,739 --> 02:06:58,129
they rewind something then that makes it
so that the pilots are not in their

4464
02:06:58,129 --> 02:06:58,139
so that the pilots are not in their
 

4465
02:06:58,139 --> 02:06:59,629
so that the pilots are not in their
airplanes anymore

so all of the humans stay higher here

so all of the humans stay higher here
 

4479
02:07:14,159 --> 02:07:16,550
so all of the humans stay higher here
must all be people who have never driven

if you think about it because once you

if you think about it because once you

02:07:20,760 --> 02:07:22,790
if you think about it because once you
take that person out of the car and

take that person out of the car and

Rewind something then the car will be

4488
02:07:25,070 --> 02:07:25,080
Rewind something then the car will be

02:07:25,080 --> 02:07:27,229
Rewind something then the car will be
driving without the driver

4490
02:07:27,229 --> 02:07:27,239
driving without the driver
 

4491
02:07:27,239 --> 02:07:29,930
driving without the driver
and crash

4492
02:07:29,930 --> 02:07:29,940
and crash
 

4493
02:07:29,940 --> 02:07:33,530

or or never starts to drive in the first

place but but if you rewind to a point

4496
02:07:35,629 --> 02:07:35,639
place but but if you rewind to a point
 

4497
02:07:35,639 --> 02:07:37,370

where it's already driving

where it's already driving
 

4499
02:07:37,380 --> 02:07:39,350

you know as I said like admit

4500
02:07:39,350 --> 02:07:39,360
you know as I said like admit

02:07:39,360 --> 02:07:42,950
you know as I said like admit
conversation and so on and then stop

4502
02:07:42,950 --> 02:07:42,960
conversation and so on and then stop
 

4503
02:07:42,960 --> 02:07:46,189
conversation and so on and then stop
there then the car is driving already

4504
02:07:46,189 --> 02:07:46,199
there then the car is driving already
 

4505
02:07:46,199 --> 02:07:50,450
there then the car is driving already
and but without a driver and then crash

4506
02:07:50,450 --> 02:07:50,460
and but without a driver and then crash
 

4507
02:07:50,460 --> 02:07:55,030
and but without a driver and then crash
it's a paradox but it's interesting

4509
02:07:55,040 --> 02:07:58,250

6437
02:58:18,080 --> 02:58:21,130

Anna is the main character and it

6438
02:58:21,130 --> 02:58:21,140
Anna is the main character and it
 

6439
02:58:21,140 --> 02:58:24,590
Anna is the main character and it
continues after where a Game of Thrones

6440
02:58:24,590 --> 02:58:24,600

6441
02:58:24,600 --> 02:58:26,929

left off where she you know left still

6442
02:58:26,929 --> 02:58:26,939
left off where she you know left still
 

6443
02:58:26,939 --> 02:58:30,530

and to go um to you know the other side

6444
02:58:30,530 --> 02:58:30,540

6447
02:58:33,420 --> 02:58:37,490

think that would be very popular I think

6448
02:58:37,490 --> 02:58:37,500
think that would be very popular I think
 

6449
02:58:37,500 --> 02:58:39,290
think that would be very popular I think
a lot of people would want to see where

6450
02:58:39,290 --> 02:58:39,300
a lot of people would want to see where
 

6451
02:58:39,300 --> 02:58:42,590
a lot of people would want to see where
Arya goes after that and and what she

6452
02:58:42,590 --> 02:58:42,600
Arya goes after that and and what she
 

6453
02:58:42,600 --> 02:58:45,230
Arya goes after that and and what she
would do

6454
02:58:45,230 --> 02:58:45,240

 

6455
02:58:45,240 --> 02:58:47,090

and who she meets and what's on the

6456
02:58:47,090 --> 02:58:47,100
and who she meets and what's on the
 

6457
02:58:47,100 --> 02:58:48,950
and who she meets and what's on the
other side and all that you know I think

6458
02:58:48,950 --> 02:58:48,960
other side and all that you know I think
 

6459
02:58:48,960 --> 02:58:50,630
other side and all that you know I think
that would work really well and since

6460
02:58:50,630 --> 02:58:50,640
that would work really well and since
 

6461
02:58:50,640 --> 02:58:53,030
that would work really well and since
that's not written down in any of the

6462
02:58:53,030 --> 02:58:53,040
that's not written down in any of the
 

6463
02:58:53,040 --> 02:58:55,250
that's not written down in any of the
books right so they would have so much

6464
02:58:55,250 --> 02:58:55,260
books right so they would have so much
 

6465
02:58:55,260 --> 02:58:57,290

like Freedom with that they don't have

6466
02:58:57,290 --> 02:58:57,300
like Freedom with that they don't have
 

6467
02:58:57,300 --> 02:58:59,870
like Freedom with that they don't have
to go buy the books but I still think it

6468
02:58:59,870 --> 02:58:59,880
to go buy the books but I still think it
 

6469
02:58:59,880 --> 02:59:02,389
to go buy the books but I still think it
would it would get a big audience I

6470

6477
02:59:09,060 --> 02:59:11,690

potential

6478
02:59:11,690 --> 02:59:11,700

 

6479
02:59:11,700 --> 02:59:14,090

6480
02:59:14,090 --> 02:59:14,100
well yeah he doesn't have to ride it
 

6481
02:59:14,100 --> 02:59:16,730
well yeah he doesn't have to ride it
because obviously he wouldn't make it in

6482
02:59:16,730 --> 02:59:16,740
because obviously he wouldn't make it in
 

6483

time
 

6485
02:59:18,319 --> 02:59:22,429

wait a second by now there should be
like a approximate lengths right for the

6566
03:01:45,590 --> 03:01:45,600
like a approximate lengths right for the
 

6567
03:01:45,600 --> 03:01:47,150
like a approximate lengths right for the
game someone must have figured it out

6568
03:01:47,150 --> 03:01:47,160
game someone must have figured it out
 

6569
03:01:47,160 --> 03:01:52,190
game someone must have figured it out
already the entropy Center game length

6570
03:01:52,190 --> 03:01:52,200
already the entropy Center game length
 

6571
03:01:52,200 --> 03:01:55,309
already the entropy Center game length
will it come up already

6572
03:01:55,309 --> 03:01:55,319
will it come up already
 

6573
03:01:55,319 --> 03:01:58,610

6579
03:02:04,920 --> 03:02:08,150
15 hour experience but I didn't see that
was like a six hour full playthrough and

6580
03:02:08,150 --> 03:02:08,160
was like a six hour full playthrough and
 

6581
03:02:08,160 --> 03:02:10,610
was like a six hour full playthrough and
a nine Hour full playthrough and a four

6613
03:02:54,840 --> 03:02:57,130

that looks optional I want to check that

7390
03:24:08,090 --> 03:24:08,100
that looks optional I want to check that
 

7391
03:24:08,100 --> 03:24:09,769
that looks optional I want to check that
out

7392
03:24:09,769 --> 03:24:09,779
out
 

7393
03:24:09,779 --> 03:24:12,110
out
it looks like optional lore is being

7394
03:24:12,110 --> 03:24:12,120
it looks like optional lore is being
 

7395
03:24:12,120 --> 03:24:17,809
it looks like optional lore is being
offered to us

7396
03:24:17,809 --> 03:24:17,819

 

7397
03:24:17,819 --> 03:24:21,050

definitely yeah but how

7398
03:24:21,050 --> 03:24:21,060
definitely yeah but how
 

7399
03:24:21,060 --> 03:24:23,030
definitely yeah but how
I guess I just

7400
03:24:23,030 --> 03:24:23,040
I guess I just
 

7401
03:24:23,040 --> 03:24:24,410
I guess I just
jump

7402
03:24:24,410 --> 03:24:24,420
jump
 

7403
03:24:24,420 --> 03:24:26,690
jump
over there but

7404
03:24:26,690 --> 03:24:26,700
over there but
 

7405
03:24:26,700 --> 03:24:27,360
over there but
from

7406
03:24:27,360 --> 03:24:27,370
from

how do I get there

7410
03:24:32,510 --> 03:24:32,520
how do I get there
 

7411
03:24:32,520 --> 03:24:35,450
how do I get there
because if I jump just from the ground I

7412
03:24:35,450 --> 03:24:35,460
because if I jump just from the ground I
 

7413
03:24:35,460 --> 03:24:37,010
because if I jump just from the ground I
won't make it but I wonder if I put the

7414
03:24:37,010 --> 03:24:37,020
won't make it but I wonder if I put the
 

7415
03:24:37,020 --> 03:24:38,450
won't make it but I wonder if I put the
platform just here

7416
03:24:38,450 --> 03:24:38,460
platform just here
 

7417
03:24:38,460 --> 03:24:41,090
platform just here
and jump from here to there to there if

7418
03:24:41,090 --> 03:24:41,100
and jump from here to there to there if
 

7419
03:24:41,100 --> 03:24:46,610
and jump from here to there to there if
that would do the trick

7420
03:24:46,610 --> 03:24:46,620

 

7421
03:24:46,620 --> 03:24:48,229

that's right so let's abandon my

03:24:48,229 --> 03:24:48,239
that's right so let's abandon my
 

7423
03:24:48,239 --> 03:24:50,269
that's right so let's abandon my
original plan right now because I'm

7424
03:24:50,269 --> 03:24:50,279
original plan right now because I'm
 

7425
03:24:50,279 --> 03:24:52,309
original plan right now because I'm
curious about this

7426
03:24:52,309 --> 03:24:52,319
curious about this
 

7427
03:24:52,319 --> 03:25:00,650

7430
03:25:04,490 --> 03:25:04,500
that was so unexpected what the [\h__\h]
 

7431
03:25:04,500 --> 03:25:09,330
that was so unexpected what the [\h__\h]

04:53:18,540 --> 04:53:23,270

hmm

10508
04:53:23,270 --> 04:53:23,280

 

10509
04:53:23,280 --> 04:53:26,270

put a jump pad ah to work so I can get

10510
04:53:26,270 --> 04:53:26,280
put a jump pad ah to work so I can get
 

10511
04:53:26,280 --> 04:53:29,868
put a jump pad ah to work so I can get
up there so that would be the second

10512
04:53:29,868 --> 04:53:29,878
up there so that would be the second
 

10513
04:53:29,878 --> 04:53:35,090
up there so that would be the second
last step

10514
04:53:35,090 --> 04:53:35,100

 

10515
04:53:35,100 --> 04:53:37,550

so that's where I need to bring it next

10516
04:53:37,550 --> 04:53:37,560
so that's where I need to bring it next
 

10517
04:53:37,560 --> 04:53:39,530
so that's where I need to bring it next
I think that would be the second last

10518
04:53:39,530 --> 04:53:39,540
I think that would be the second last
 

10519
04:53:39,540 --> 04:53:43,610
I think that would be the second last

10521
04:53:43,620 --> 04:53:47,030

so the third last step is this so here

10522
04:53:47,030 --> 04:53:47,040
so the third last step is this so here

05:07:22,250 --> 05:07:22,260
bringing the cube over here but why can
 

10961
05:07:22,260 --> 05:07:24,170
bringing the cube over here but why can
I not just carry it over here and place

through the water or is that just to
 

10967
05:07:27,480 --> 05:07:29,570

still be in the final position up there

11096
05:11:37,128 --> 05:11:37,138
still be in the final position up there
 

11097
05:11:37,138 --> 05:11:40,128
still be in the final position up there
so I can not go through the defense

11098
05:11:40,128 --> 05:11:40,138
so I can not go through the defense
 

11099
05:11:40,138 --> 05:11:42,470
so I can not go through the defense
thingy but go through like the last part

11100
05:11:42,470 --> 05:11:42,480
thingy but go through like the last part
 

11101
05:11:42,480 --> 05:11:43,910
thingy but go through like the last part
the bridge is only for the last part

11102
05:11:43,910 --> 05:11:43,920
the bridge is only for the last part

12403
05:52:05,580 --> 05:52:09,890

we should be able to

12404
05:52:09,890 --> 05:52:09,900
we should be able to
 

12405
05:52:09,900 --> 05:52:12,470
we should be able to
since we can rewind the Earth

12406
05:52:12,470 --> 05:52:12,480
since we can rewind the Earth
 

12407
05:52:12,480 --> 05:52:16,850
since we can rewind the Earth
we can also rewind the asteroid right

12408
05:52:16,850 --> 05:52:16,860
we can also rewind the asteroid right
 

12409
05:52:16,860 --> 05:52:19,190
we can also rewind the asteroid right
why don't we just stop it

12410
05:52:19,190 --> 05:52:19,200
why don't we just stop it
 

12411
05:52:19,200 --> 05:52:21,708
why don't we just stop it
right before you know somewhere in the

12412
05:52:21,708 --> 05:52:21,718
right before you know somewhere in the
 

12413
05:52:21,718 --> 05:52:24,350
right before you know somewhere in the
middle on travel to the Earth before it

12414
05:52:24,350 --> 05:52:24,360
middle on travel to the Earth before it
 

12415
05:52:24,360 --> 05:52:25,910
middle on travel to the Earth before it
bumps into the Earth why don't we just

12416
05:52:25,910 --> 05:52:25,920
bumps into the Earth why don't we just
 

12417
05:52:25,920 --> 05:52:28,548
bumps into the Earth why don't we just
stop it there

12418
05:52:28,548 --> 05:52:28,558

 

12419
05:52:28,558 --> 05:52:32,890

if it goes

12420
05:52:32,890 --> 05:52:32,900

 

12421
05:52:32,900 --> 05:52:36,590

uh no if if it's like

12422
05:52:36,590 --> 05:52:36,600
uh no if if it's like
 

12423
05:52:36,600 --> 05:52:39,170
uh no if if it's like
um if that does not stop

12424
05:52:39,170 --> 05:52:39,180
um if that does not stop
 

12425
05:52:39,180 --> 05:52:42,230
um if that does not stop
I mean no it wouldn't send a new one to

12426
05:52:42,230 --> 05:52:42,240
I mean no it wouldn't send a new one to
 

12427
05:52:42,240 --> 05:52:43,970
I mean no it wouldn't send a new one to
replace that one because that one is

12428
05:52:43,970 --> 05:52:43,980
replace that one because that one is
 

12429
05:52:43,980 --> 05:52:46,788
replace that one because that one is
still existing in that timeline so the

12430
05:52:46,788 --> 05:52:46,798
still existing in that timeline so the
 

12431
05:52:46,798 --> 05:52:50,690
still existing in that timeline so the
same asteroid would not come again

12432
05:52:50,690 --> 05:52:50,700

 

12433
05:52:50,700 --> 05:52:54,350

right

12434
05:52:54,350 --> 05:52:54,360

 

12435
05:52:54,360 --> 05:52:56,208

that's not how space works yeah but

12436
05:52:56,208 --> 05:52:56,218
that's not how space works yeah but
 

12437
05:52:56,218 --> 05:52:58,070
that's not how space works yeah but
that's how time works

12438
05:52:58,070 --> 05:52:58,080
that's how time works
 

12439
05:52:58,080 --> 05:52:59,750
that's how time works
space

12440
05:52:59,750 --> 05:52:59,760
space
 

12441
05:52:59,760 --> 05:53:04,850
space
can be even space can be stopped by time

12442
05:53:04,850 --> 05:53:04,860
can be even space can be stopped by time
 

12443
05:53:04,860 --> 05:53:07,010
can be even space can be stopped by time
as you've seen with the Earth why if it

12444
05:53:07,010 --> 05:53:07,020
as you've seen with the Earth why if it
 

12445
05:53:07,020 --> 05:53:08,868
as you've seen with the Earth why if it
works with the Earth why can't it worked

12446
05:53:08,868 --> 05:53:08,878
works with the Earth why can't it worked
 

12447
05:53:08,878 --> 05:53:10,970
works with the Earth why can't it worked
with an asteroid

12448
05:53:10,970 --> 05:53:10,980
with an asteroid
 

12449
05:53:10,980 --> 05:53:12,650
with an asteroid
is it even an asteroid it might have

12450
05:53:12,650 --> 05:53:12,660
is it even an asteroid it might have
 

12451
05:53:12,660 --> 05:53:17,170
is it even an asteroid it might have
been an explosion

12452
05:53:17,170 --> 05:53:17,180

 

12453
05:53:17,180 --> 05:53:19,788

I don't know but but they'll say it's an

12454
05:53:19,788 --> 05:53:19,798
I don't know but but they'll say it's an
 

12455
05:53:19,798 --> 05:53:21,470
I don't know but but they'll say it's an
astronaut we can just stop the asteroid

12456
05:53:21,470 --> 05:53:21,480
astronaut we can just stop the asteroid
 

12457
05:53:21,480 --> 05:53:23,628
astronaut we can just stop the asteroid
okay but okay maybe it's not an asteroid

12458
05:53:23,628 --> 05:53:23,638
okay but okay maybe it's not an asteroid
 

12459
05:53:23,638 --> 05:53:24,830
okay but okay maybe it's not an asteroid
and that's why that didn't come to that

12460
05:53:24,830 --> 05:53:24,840
and that's why that didn't come to that
 

12461
05:53:24,840 --> 05:53:27,708
and that's why that didn't come to that
conclusion

12462
05:53:27,708 --> 05:53:27,718

 

12463
05:53:27,718 --> 05:53:30,110

um areas that we have yet to see
 

13307
06:18:18,120 --> 06:18:20,930
um areas that we have yet to see
in this one

13308
06:18:20,930 --> 06:18:20,940
in this one
 

13309
06:18:20,940 --> 06:18:22,850
in this one
and if you think about that and I guess

13310
06:18:22,850 --> 06:18:22,860
and if you think about that and I guess
 

13311
06:18:22,860 --> 06:18:24,770

what we've seen so far has been a little

06:18:26,458 --> 06:18:29,030

13316
06:18:29,030 --> 06:18:29,040
but I think there will be like more
 

13317
06:18:29,040 --> 06:18:32,208
but I think there will be like more
different scenery in the second half and

13318
06:18:32,208 --> 06:18:32,218
different scenery in the second half and
 

13319
06:18:32,218 --> 06:18:36,650
different scenery in the second half and
bigger areas as well probably

the first place
that could be a thing

14026
06:36:20,990 --> 06:36:21,000
that could be a thing
 

14027
06:36:21,000 --> 06:36:24,650
that could be a thing
who knows but yeah I'm sure they're they

14028
06:36:24,650 --> 06:36:24,660
who knows but yeah I'm sure they're they
 

14029
06:36:24,660 --> 06:36:26,810
who knows but yeah I'm sure they're they
they would add more countries if they

14030
06:36:26,810 --> 06:36:26,820
they would add more countries if they
 

14031
06:36:26,820 --> 06:36:30,048
they would add more countries if they
could and if it can be improved in the

06:36:30,048 --> 06:36:30,058
could and if it can be improved in the
 

14033
06:36:30,058 --> 06:36:32,048
could and if it can be improved in the
future then they surely will

14034
06:36:32,048 --> 06:36:32,058
future then they surely will
 

14035
06:36:32,058 --> 06:36:36,288
future then they surely will
hopefully hopefully

14036
06:36:36,288 --> 06:36:36,298

 

14037
06:36:36,298 --> 06:36:38,810

yeah yeah Amazon on Demand that's what

14038
06:36:38,810 --> 06:36:38,820
yeah yeah Amazon on Demand that's what
 

14039
06:36:38,820 --> 06:36:40,430
yeah yeah Amazon on Demand that's what
it's called yeah I am

14040
06:36:40,430 --> 06:36:40,440
it's called yeah I am
 

14041
06:36:40,440 --> 06:36:43,250
it's called yeah I am
I'm guessing as well that that just

14042
06:36:43,250 --> 06:36:43,260
I'm guessing as well that that just
 

14043
06:36:43,260 --> 06:36:45,170
I'm guessing as well that that just
might be

14044
06:36:45,170 --> 06:36:45,180
might be
 

14045
06:36:45,180 --> 06:36:47,990
might be
the problem some countries don't have

14046
06:36:47,990 --> 06:36:48,000
the problem some countries don't have
 

14047

the problem some countries don't have
Amazon on Demand I honestly didn't even

Amazon on Demand I honestly didn't even
 

14049
06:36:51,120 --> 06:36:53,270
Amazon on Demand I honestly didn't even
know about this thing

14050
06:36:53,270 --> 06:36:53,280
know about this thing
 

14051
06:36:53,280 --> 06:36:55,788
know about this thing
until very recently for whole life

14052
06:36:55,788 --> 06:36:55,798
until very recently for whole life
 

14053
06:36:55,798 --> 06:36:57,110

06:36:57,110 --> 06:36:57,120
merchandise
 

14055
06:36:57,120 --> 06:37:00,170
merchandise
I did not know that that was a thing

14056
06:37:00,170 --> 06:37:00,180
I did not know that that was a thing
 

14057
06:37:00,180 --> 06:37:03,470
I did not know that that was a thing
they basically they create

14058
06:37:03,470 --> 06:37:03,480
they basically they create
 

14059
06:37:03,480 --> 06:37:06,650
they basically they create
Amazon creates the merchandise on demand

14060
06:37:06,650 --> 06:37:06,660
Amazon creates the merchandise on demand
 

14061
06:37:06,660 --> 06:37:08,390
Amazon creates the merchandise on demand
basically

14062
06:37:08,390 --> 06:37:08,400
basically
 

14063
06:37:08,400 --> 06:37:14,390
basically
yeah so yeah it's really good for us

14064
06:37:14,390 --> 06:37:14,400
yeah so yeah it's really good for us
 

14065
06:37:14,400 --> 06:37:16,548
yeah so yeah it's really good for us
such a good solution

14066
06:37:16,548 --> 06:37:16,558
such a good solution
 

14067
06:37:16,558 --> 06:37:18,590
such a good solution
so

14068
06:37:18,590 --> 06:37:18,600
so
 

14069
06:37:18,600 --> 06:37:21,590
so
maybe I wonder if we can no no I guess

14070
06:37:21,590 --> 06:37:21,600
maybe I wonder if we can no no I guess
 

14071
06:37:21,600 --> 06:37:22,610
maybe I wonder if we can no no I guess
not

14072
06:37:22,610 --> 06:37:22,620
not
 

14073
06:37:22,620 --> 06:37:24,470
not
yeah this will most likely not be

14074
06:37:24,470 --> 06:37:24,480
yeah this will most likely not be
 

14075
06:37:24,480 --> 06:37:26,030
yeah this will most likely not be
possible with birthday merchandise

14076
06:37:26,030 --> 06:37:26,040
possible with birthday merchandise
 

14077
06:37:26,040 --> 06:37:27,288
possible with birthday merchandise
because

14078
06:37:27,288 --> 06:37:27,298
because
 

14079
06:37:27,298 --> 06:37:29,330
because
I think for Amazon on Demand there's

14080
06:37:29,330 --> 06:37:29,340
I think for Amazon on Demand there's
 

14081
06:37:29,340 --> 06:37:30,948
I think for Amazon on Demand there's
like templates

14082
06:37:30,948 --> 06:37:30,958
like templates
 

14083
06:37:30,958 --> 06:37:34,490
like templates
for what items

14084
06:37:34,490 --> 06:37:34,500
for what items
 

14085
06:37:34,500 --> 06:37:38,650
for what items
and what colors and what size Etc

14086
06:37:38,650 --> 06:37:38,660
and what colors and what size Etc
 

14087
06:37:38,660 --> 06:37:41,270
and what colors and what size Etc
and then put like your image on top of

14088
06:37:41,270 --> 06:37:41,280
and then put like your image on top of
 

14089
06:37:41,280 --> 06:37:42,530
and then put like your image on top of
that or whatever

14090
06:37:42,530 --> 06:37:42,540
that or whatever
 

14091
06:37:42,540 --> 06:37:44,990
that or whatever
so for birthday merchandise I suppose it

14092
06:37:44,990 --> 06:37:45,000
so for birthday merchandise I suppose it
 

14093
06:37:45,000 --> 06:37:47,628
so for birthday merchandise I suppose it
