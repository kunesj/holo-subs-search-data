and it's working really well i think
 

269
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,750
and it's working really well i think
so i mean it's not not exactly

270
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:23,760
so i mean it's not not exactly
 

271
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,829
so i mean it's not not exactly
not exactly prime time here yet i

272
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:25,839
not exactly prime time here yet i
 

273
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,069
not exactly prime time here yet i
suppose but close enough

274
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:28,079
suppose but close enough
 

275
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,670
suppose but close enough
uh i think yeah i'll test it some more
