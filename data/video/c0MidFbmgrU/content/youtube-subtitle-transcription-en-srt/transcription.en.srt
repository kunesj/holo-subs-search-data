i mean there are definitely people out

1526
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:38,560
i mean there are definitely people out
 

1527
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:39,910
i mean there are definitely people out
there who like to count their steps

1528
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:39,920
there who like to count their steps
 

1529
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,349
there who like to count their steps
because they need a certain amount of

1530
00:44:41,349 --> 00:44:41,359
because they need a certain amount of
 

1531
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:43,589
because they need a certain amount of
steps per day that they're

1532
00:44:43,589 --> 00:44:43,599
steps per day that they're
 

1533
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:45,670
steps per day that they're
that's their goal

1534
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:45,680
that's their goal
 

1535
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,670
that's their goal
so instead of a normal step counter they

1536
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:47,680
so instead of a normal step counter they
 

1537
00:44:47,680 --> 00:45:02,230
so instead of a normal step counter they
could use that this i guess

1538
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:02,240

 

1539
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,390
