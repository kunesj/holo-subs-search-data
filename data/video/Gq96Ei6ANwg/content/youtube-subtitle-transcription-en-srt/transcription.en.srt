01:33:24,709 --> 01:33:24,719
round maybe should I change my strategy
 

2947
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:27,470
round maybe should I change my strategy
maybe I shouldn't build no no it's okay

2948
01:33:27,470 --> 01:33:27,480
maybe I shouldn't build no no it's okay

it's okay don't worry I think you're

2950
01:33:28,470 --> 01:33:28,480
it's okay don't worry I think you're
 

2951
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:31,629
it's okay don't worry I think you're
doing well okay okay but think of what I

2952
01:33:31,629 --> 01:33:31,639
doing well okay okay but think of what I
 

2953
01:33:31,639 --> 01:33:32,990
doing well okay okay but think of what I
what else I could think of and how you

2954
01:33:32,990 --> 01:33:33,000
what else I could think of and how you
 

2955
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:34,790
what else I could think of and how you
could prevent me of thinking of those

2956
01:33:34,790 --> 01:33:34,800
could prevent me of thinking of those
 

2957
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:39,229
could prevent me of thinking of those
things that's um that's a little

2958
01:33:39,229 --> 01:33:39,239
things that's um that's a little
 

2959
01:33:39,239 --> 01:33:44,709
things that's um that's a little
bit especially cuz oo is k i you know

bit especially cuz oo is k i you know
 

2961
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:47,070

yeah okay like like if you give it

2962
01:33:47,070 --> 01:33:47,080
yeah okay like like if you give it
 

2963
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:48,590
yeah okay like like if you give it

but it's probably not going to be a car

2966
01:33:49,950 --> 01:33:49,960
but it's probably not going to be a car
 

2967
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:51,950
but it's probably not going to be a car
again so we'll see we'll see yeah

2968
01:33:51,950 --> 01:33:51,960
again so we'll see we'll see yeah
 

2969
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:54,229
again so we'll see we'll see yeah
because there's not enough block to a

because there's not enough block to a
 

2971
01:33:54,239 --> 01:33:56,310
because there's not enough block to a
different shape okay I'll do this I I'll

2972
01:33:56,310 --> 01:33:56,320
different shape okay I'll do this I I'll
 

2973

again ah now I see they were building

2976
01:33:59,950 --> 01:33:59,960
again ah now I see they were building
 

2977
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:01,629
again ah now I see they were building
like upwards maybe because they wanted

2978
01:34:01,629 --> 01:34:01,639
like upwards maybe because they wanted
 

2979
01:34:01,639 --> 01:34:04,149
like upwards maybe because they wanted
to do three dimensional like an actual

2980
01:34:04,149 --> 01:34:04,159
to do three dimensional like an actual
 

2981
01:34:04,159 --> 01:34:05,709
to do three dimensional like an actual
car but that would that one minute one

2982
01:34:05,709 --> 01:34:05,719
car but that would that one minute one
 

2983
01:34:05,719 --> 01:34:08,750
car but that would that one minute one
minute as we now know is way too little

2984
01:34:08,750 --> 01:34:08,760
minute as we now know is way too little
 

2985
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:11,910
minute as we now know is way too little
not as long as we thought

2986
01:34:11,910 --> 01:34:11,920
not as long as we thought
 

2987
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:16,470
not as long as we thought
so Shear shears okay well I'm going to I

2988
01:34:16,470 --> 01:34:16,480
so Shear shears okay well I'm going to I
 

2989
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:19,430
so Shear shears okay well I'm going to I
might try building three di yeah but but

2990
01:34:19,430 --> 01:34:19,440
might try building three di yeah but but
 

2991
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:21,790
might try building three di yeah but but
but you know how how short the one

2992
01:34:21,790 --> 01:34:21,800
but you know how how short the one
 

2993
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:23,830
but you know how how short the one
minute just was I don't know if you can

2994
01:34:23,830 --> 01:34:23,840
minute just was I don't know if you can
 

2995
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:25,910
minute just was I don't know if you can
build three dimensional like at least

2996
01:34:25,910 --> 01:34:25,920
build three dimensional like at least
 

2997
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:28,790
build three dimensional like at least
you can build flat dimens F on round

2998
01:34:28,790 --> 01:34:28,800
you can build flat dimens F on round
 

2999
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:30,830
you can build flat dimens F on round
Wheels if there's not even enough pixel

why but
 

3343
01:43:20,679 --> 01:43:23,990
why but
like I wish we could choose our colors I

3344
01:43:23,990 --> 01:43:24,000
like I wish we could choose our colors I
 

3345
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,589
like I wish we could choose our colors I
wish we could choose our colors honestly

wish we could choose our colors honestly
 

3347
01:43:26,599 --> 01:43:28,229
wish we could choose our colors honestly
because even even though color doesn't

3348
01:43:28,229 --> 01:43:28,239
because even even though color doesn't
 

3349
01:43:28,239 --> 01:43:31,950
because even even though color doesn't
make sense it kind of gives you the bias

3350
01:43:31,950 --> 01:43:31,960
make sense it kind of gives you the bias
 

3351
01:43:31,960 --> 01:43:34,990

building with yellow I would 100% think

3368
01:43:56,030 --> 01:43:56,040
building with yellow I would 100% think
 

3369

matter
yeah everyone should build with

3376
01:44:09,830 --> 01:44:09,840

 

3377
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:13,910

3433
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:42,830

ah why is theirs

3434
01:45:42,830 --> 01:45:42,840
ah why is theirs
 

3435
01:45:42,840 --> 01:45:46,430
ah why is theirs
roundish and yours is like flat on the

3436
01:45:46,430 --> 01:45:46,440
roundish and yours is like flat on the
 

3437
01:45:46,440 --> 01:45:55,189
roundish and yours is like flat on the
bottom

3438
01:45:55,189 --> 01:45:55,199

 

3439
01:45:55,199 --> 01:45:56,550

like that's red so it makes me think of

3440
01:45:56,550 --> 01:45:56,560
like that's red so it makes me think of
 

3441
01:45:56,560 --> 01:45:59,070
like that's red so it makes me think of
a cherry over there

3442
01:45:59,070 --> 01:45:59,080
a cherry over there
 

3443
01:45:59,080 --> 01:46:02,270
a cherry over there
but this doesn't look like a

3444
01:46:02,270 --> 01:46:02,280
but this doesn't look like a
 

3445
01:46:02,280 --> 01:46:04,430
but this doesn't look like a
cherry there's probably there's probably

3446
01:46:04,430 --> 01:46:04,440
cherry there's probably there's probably
 

3447
01:46:04,440 --> 01:46:07,589
cherry there's probably there's probably
a reason for that if one and tree looks

3448
01:46:07,589 --> 01:46:07,599
a reason for that if one and tree looks
 

3449
01:46:07,599 --> 01:46:09,350
a reason for that if one and tree looks
like a cherry and the others

3450
01:46:09,350 --> 01:46:09,360
like a cherry and the others
 

3451
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:12,550
like a cherry and the others
don't yeah because it's not a cherry

3452
01:46:12,550 --> 01:46:12,560
don't yeah because it's not a cherry
 

3453
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:14,070
don't yeah because it's not a cherry
that looks

3454
01:46:14,070 --> 01:46:14,080
that looks
 

3455
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:16,750
that looks
like that looks like an Al sorry sorry

3456
01:46:16,750 --> 01:46:16,760
like that looks like an Al sorry sorry
 

3457
01:46:16,760 --> 01:46:20,070
like that looks like an Al sorry sorry
sorry actually that looks awesome

3458
01:46:20,070 --> 01:46:20,080
sorry actually that looks awesome
 

3459
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:23,790
sorry actually that looks awesome
ah is this just making it pretty

3460
01:46:23,790 --> 01:46:23,800
ah is this just making it pretty
 

3461
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:25,550
ah is this just making it pretty
but is it but that could be a lot of

3462
01:46:25,550 --> 01:46:25,560
but is it but that could be a lot of
 

3463
01:46:25,560 --> 01:46:27,550
but is it but that could be a lot of
things it could be potion it could be

3464
01:46:27,550 --> 01:46:27,560
things it could be potion it could be
 

3465
01:46:27,560 --> 01:46:31,830
things it could be potion it could be
bottle maybe more but it could be a lot

3466
01:46:31,830 --> 01:46:31,840
bottle maybe more but it could be a lot
 

3467
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:34,070
bottle maybe more but it could be a lot
of things so even if you get it wrong

3468
01:46:34,070 --> 01:46:34,080
of things so even if you get it wrong
 

3469
01:46:34,080 --> 01:46:35,790
of things so even if you get it wrong
it's not your fault maybe bottle because

3470
01:46:35,790 --> 01:46:35,800
it's not your fault maybe bottle because
 

3471
01:46:35,800 --> 01:46:38,030
it's not your fault maybe bottle because
like that is square and that's if if it

3472
01:46:38,030 --> 01:46:38,040
like that is square and that's if if it
 

3473
01:46:38,040 --> 01:46:41,310
like that is square and that's if if it
was a

3474
01:46:41,310 --> 01:46:41,320

 

3475
01:46:41,320 --> 01:46:44,270

what um I'm not giving up on 3D builds

3480
01:46:53,390 --> 01:46:53,400
what um I'm not giving up on 3D builds
 

3481
01:46:53,400 --> 01:46:56,229
what um I'm not giving up on 3D builds
it's like um some stuff are better

3482

just going to clim it so red and then
 

5151
02:37:32,399 --> 02:37:35,389
just going to clim it so red and then
clockwise red pink purple pink purple

there's gray next to Red on the right
 

5157
02:37:39,319 --> 02:37:40,950
there's gray next to Red on the right
side know and

then afterward is oh me look over there
 

5161
02:37:44,200 --> 02:37:46,389
then afterward is oh me look over there
let me check what's next to gray we

5162
02:37:46,389 --> 02:37:46,399
let me check what's next to gray we
 

5163
02:37:46,399 --> 02:37:48,309
let me check what's next to gray we
don't have OptiFine I hope nobody here

5164
02:37:48,309 --> 02:37:48,319
don't have OptiFine I hope nobody here
 

5165
02:37:48,319 --> 02:37:51,349
don't have OptiFine I hope nobody here
has OptiFine or else they have like a oh

5166
02:37:51,349 --> 02:37:51,359
has OptiFine or else they have like a oh
 

5167
02:37:51,359 --> 02:37:53,150
has OptiFine or else they have like a oh
that's like red that's like kylo red

5168
02:37:53,150 --> 02:37:53,160
that's like red that's like kylo red
 

5169
02:37:53,160 --> 02:37:56,309
that's like red that's like kylo red
after

5170
02:37:56,309 --> 02:37:56,319

 

5171
02:37:56,319 --> 02:38:01,590

gray order is the order is um Ali and

5172
02:38:01,590 --> 02:38:01,600
gray order is the order is um Ali and
 

5173
02:38:01,600 --> 02:38:03,870
gray order is the order is um Ali and
then like Aria 15 on the left and then

5174
02:38:03,870 --> 02:38:03,880
then like Aria 15 on the left and then
 

5175
02:38:03,880 --> 02:38:07,349
then like Aria 15 on the left and then
Holo is like in the middle-ish and but I

5176
02:38:07,349 --> 02:38:07,359
Holo is like in the middle-ish and but I
 

5177
02:38:07,359 --> 02:38:10,030
Holo is like in the middle-ish and but I
don't know those H blue there's like a

5178
02:38:10,030 --> 02:38:10,040
don't know those H blue there's like a
 

5179
02:38:10,040 --> 02:38:13,870
don't know those H blue there's like a
nice blue next to Kyla red like blue

5180
02:38:13,870 --> 02:38:13,880
nice blue next to Kyla red like blue
 

5181
02:38:13,880 --> 02:38:15,790
nice blue next to Kyla red like blue
that's uh that's Kobo blue I know Kobo

5182
02:38:15,790 --> 02:38:15,800
that's uh that's Kobo blue I know Kobo
 

5183
02:38:15,800 --> 02:38:17,190
that's uh that's Kobo blue I know Kobo
blue is probably on the right I'm just

5184
02:38:17,190 --> 02:38:17,200
blue is probably on the right I'm just
 

5185
02:38:17,200 --> 02:38:18,630
blue is probably on the right I'm just
guessing and then besides Kobo blue I

5186
02:38:18,630 --> 02:38:18,640
guessing and then besides Kobo blue I
 

5187
02:38:18,640 --> 02:38:20,790
guessing and then besides Kobo blue I
think it's definitely mine ah yeah

5188
02:38:20,790 --> 02:38:20,800
think it's definitely mine ah yeah
 

5189
02:38:20,800 --> 02:38:23,190
think it's definitely mine ah yeah
there's another blue yeah and then I

5190
02:38:23,190 --> 02:38:23,200
there's another blue yeah and then I
 

5191
02:38:23,200 --> 02:38:24,790
there's another blue yeah and then I
know I know the order yes I know the

5192
02:38:24,790 --> 02:38:24,800
know I know the order yes I know the
 

5193
02:38:24,800 --> 02:38:27,670
know I know the order yes I know the
order and then there's lime green right

5194
02:38:27,670 --> 02:38:27,680
order and then there's lime green right
 

5195
02:38:27,680 --> 02:38:29,990
order and then there's lime green right
is that GRE lime green that's E's color

5196
02:38:29,990 --> 02:38:30,000
is that GRE lime green that's E's color
 

5197
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,349
is that GRE lime green that's E's color
so it's basically uh on the left it's

5198
02:38:32,349 --> 02:38:32,359
so it's basically uh on the left it's
 

5199
02:38:32,359 --> 02:38:35,389
so it's basically uh on the left it's
ARA 15 on the middle is Holo when on the

5200
02:38:35,389 --> 02:38:35,399
ARA 15 on the middle is Holo when on the
 

5201
02:38:35,399 --> 02:38:37,030
ARA 15 on the middle is Holo when on the
right if you go over there I I won't

next to something next to something so
 

5239
02:39:26,279 --> 02:39:29,429
next to something next to something so
it's like a 3X3 and like left center

5240
02:39:29,429 --> 02:39:29,439
it's like a 3X3 and like left center
 

5241
02:39:29,439 --> 02:39:31,950
it's like a 3X3 and like left center
right from left from left top to bottom

5242
02:39:31,950 --> 02:39:31,960
right from left from left top to bottom
 

5243
02:39:31,960 --> 02:39:35,230
right from left from left top to bottom
is GRE lime green and then what we

5244
02:39:35,230 --> 02:39:35,240
is GRE lime green and then what we
 

5245
02:39:35,240 --> 02:39:37,750
is GRE lime green and then what we
should yeah when whenever I say left or

5246
02:39:37,750 --> 02:39:37,760
should yeah when whenever I say left or
 

5247
02:39:37,760 --> 02:39:40,110
should yeah when whenever I say left or
right we should decide at least that

5248
02:39:40,110 --> 02:39:40,120
right we should decide at least that
 

5249
02:39:40,120 --> 02:39:42,070
right we should decide at least that
it's like left when you look at the

5250
02:39:42,070 --> 02:39:42,080
it's like left when you look at the
 

5251
02:39:42,080 --> 02:39:45,110
it's like left when you look at the
center of the field right um you know if

5252
02:39:45,110 --> 02:39:45,120
center of the field right um you know if
 

5253
02:39:45,120 --> 02:39:48,190
center of the field right um you know if
I say left I mean left to the like no

I say left I mean left to the like no
 

5255
02:39:48,200 --> 02:39:49,790
I say left I mean left to the like no
that's confusing because I we'll turn

5256
02:39:49,790 --> 02:39:49,800
that's confusing because I we'll turn
 

5257
02:39:49,800 --> 02:39:53,630
that's confusing because I we'll turn
around just say um go closer to purple

5258
02:39:53,630 --> 02:39:53,640
around just say um go closer to purple
 

5259
02:39:53,640 --> 02:39:55,150
around just say um go closer to purple
or something and then if I go the wrong

5260
02:39:55,150 --> 02:39:55,160
or something and then if I go the wrong
 

5261
02:39:55,160 --> 02:39:57,550
or something and then if I go the wrong
way you can just say no the other way

5262
02:39:57,550 --> 02:39:57,560
way you can just say no the other way
 

5263
02:39:57,560 --> 02:40:00,349
way you can just say no the other way
okay okay it's going to be chaotic but
