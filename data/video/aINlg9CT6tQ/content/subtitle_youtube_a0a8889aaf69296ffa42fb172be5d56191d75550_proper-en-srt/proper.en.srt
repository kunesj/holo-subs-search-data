00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,766
(Did you see Kiara from Hololive calling Segu cute?)
A big streamer mentioned me..?

2
00:00:03,598 --> 00:00:06,083
Takanashi Kiara
Hololive EN ㆍ 1.5M Subscribers

3
00:00:06,083 --> 00:00:09,466
I looked up the- there was a Korean.. uh VTuber

4
00:00:09,466 --> 00:00:11,383
"Gosegu" that I didn't hear of before

5
00:00:11,383 --> 00:00:12,599
So I checked it out

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:13,116
And, and

7
00:00:13,116 --> 00:00:14,133
She was so cute

8
00:00:22,366 --> 00:00:26,949
(Gosegu was Nominated in Filian's VTuber Awards)
The... one of the nominations was a.. Korean Twitch VTuber

9
00:00:27,716 --> 00:00:29,549
That only streams in Korean

10
00:00:29,549 --> 00:00:31,783
And also only in 3D, it seems like it

11
00:00:31,783 --> 00:00:33,416
She's so cute though

12
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:34,433
Gosegu Cute!

13
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:38,199
Gosegu Cute!

14
00:00:38,866 --> 00:00:39,883
Gosegu Cute! x2

15
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:41,516
Gosegu Cute! x3

16
00:00:43,999 --> 00:00:45,133
(What is this?!)
Nan desu ka?!

17
00:00:45,133 --> 00:00:46,516
What is this?!

18
00:00:48,383 --> 00:00:50,249
Does this even make sense?!

19
00:00:50,249 --> 00:00:52,116
Wow stuff like this really happens~

20
00:00:52,116 --> 00:00:53,549
I'm really..

21
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:54,383
Really....

22
00:00:54,383 --> 00:00:56,016
(Amazed + Moved)

23
00:00:56,016 --> 00:00:59,033
I really like hololive..

24
00:00:59,033 --> 00:01:00,233
Really really

25
00:01:00,233 --> 00:01:01,433
Thank you..

26
00:01:01,699 --> 00:01:04,316
Segu-bro did you see Kiara's tweet?

27
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:09,483
Wait she's so cute I love her

28
00:01:09,483 --> 00:01:12,433
Can I adopt her? 😭❤️🥺👉👈

29
00:01:12,433 --> 00:01:17,316
Omg LOL her facial expression is so cute!!!!

30
00:01:17,316 --> 00:01:21,399
She speaks a bit of English and Japanese it seems...?

31
00:01:21,399 --> 00:01:23,866
(She even followed her account)

32
00:01:23,866 --> 00:01:26,533
Kiara has, on Twitter

33
00:01:26,533 --> 00:01:28,566
Watched my clips

34
00:01:28,566 --> 00:01:29,649
Even followed!

35
00:01:29,649 --> 00:01:31,749
Wow this is huge, right?

36
00:01:31,749 --> 00:01:33,499
Thank you~!

37
00:01:34,199 --> 00:01:36,349
Kiara continues to mention Gosegu on social media

38
00:01:36,349 --> 00:01:38,583
I actually want to, on Twitter

39
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:41,083
Reply back to Kiara

40
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:42,733
Actually for me, stuff like this..

41
00:01:42,733 --> 00:01:44,366
I'm very shy about it, yeah?

42
00:01:44,366 --> 00:01:45,666
"Wait am I being too obnoxious..?"

43
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:46,766
"Is this overreacting..?"

44
00:01:46,766 --> 00:01:47,249
"Ah wait a minute"

45
00:01:47,249 --> 00:01:48,316
"Am I getting ahead of myself?"

46
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,216
"Am I getting waaaaay ahead of myself on this?"

47
00:01:50,216 --> 00:01:51,116
Thinking all that..

48
00:01:51,116 --> 00:01:52,583
I hearted it and ran away!

49
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:53,849
"How should I answer her?"

50
00:01:53,849 --> 00:01:55,716
I've been thinking about it and..

51
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:57,333
I thought for a whole hour ..

52
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:58,749
And I didn't reply in the end..

53
00:01:59,016 --> 00:02:02,233
Segu-bro I think Kiara likes your new outfit too

54
00:02:08,633 --> 00:02:09,666
OMG I'm so trash

55
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:12,499
I didn't know how to reply to Kiara so I @#$%&

56
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,049
And I just uh? Clicked heart and ran

57
00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:15,466
Cuz I don't even know how to answer it

58
00:02:15,466 --> 00:02:16,366
I was so embarrassed I ran away

59
00:02:16,366 --> 00:02:17,199
And I was thinking what do I do but Kiara went-

60
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:19,716
(Calm)

61
00:02:19,716 --> 00:02:21,399
What do I actually do..?

62
00:02:21,399 --> 00:02:24,016
Thank you Kiara-san..

63
00:02:24,016 --> 00:02:25,766
Isn't this nuts..?

64
00:02:25,766 --> 00:02:29,216
Segu-tan Kiara responded to your rap too

65
00:02:30,299 --> 00:02:30,633
Oh

66
00:02:30,633 --> 00:02:30,816
Oh my

67
00:02:30,816 --> 00:02:31,249
Oh my god

68
00:02:31,249 --> 00:02:31,616
Oh my god come

69
00:02:31,616 --> 00:02:32,566
Ooooooooon!!

70
00:02:33,966 --> 00:02:35,966
She didn't answer me or anything

71
00:02:35,966 --> 00:02:38,483
so I thought she doesn't wanna be friends

72
00:02:38,483 --> 00:02:40,033
SEGU COME TO MEEEEEE ?!

73
00:02:43,483 --> 00:02:46,216
(Replying to Kiara Right Away)

74
00:02:49,899 --> 00:02:53,749
Now days instead of "Merry Christmas" they say "Happy Holidays" more

75
00:02:53,749 --> 00:02:54,266
Yeah?

76
00:02:54,266 --> 00:02:56,366
They say "Happy Holiday" a lot?

77
00:02:58,533 --> 00:03:00,966
Is holy spelled 'Holly'?

78
00:03:00,966 --> 00:03:01,133
Let's do X-mas then, X-mas~

79
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:03,833
(Holly Molly LUL)
Let's do X-mas then, X-mas~

80
00:03:09,483 --> 00:03:11,116
(Literally Dying)

81
00:03:11,116 --> 00:03:13,183
Merry Hollyday lmaooooo

82
00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:18,066
'Merry Hollyday'

83
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:19,533
I tried to send that? lol

84
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,583
So yeah, I was actually doing it

85
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,933
Cuz I didn't know;;

86
00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:26,333
If I just sent it like this..

87
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,716
It would have been embarrassing!

88
00:03:27,716 --> 00:03:30,933
(Later She Replied Properly)

89
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:35,999
Listening to Kiara's Original Song
〈Fire N Ice〉

90
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:38,116
Yo Segu-bro she was watching you

91
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:40,633
(Kiara was watching the stream live)

92
00:03:43,366 --> 00:03:45,066
Wait is my sound booth getting warmer

93
00:03:45,066 --> 00:03:46,516
Or did my face get hotter?

94
00:03:46,516 --> 00:03:47,783
Wait looool

95
00:03:47,783 --> 00:03:48,616
Wait-!

96
00:03:48,616 --> 00:03:49,083
Hey-!!

97
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:54,499
Kiara was 5 min late just to watch this

98
00:03:55,649 --> 00:03:57,433
Wait, Kiara-san!!

99
00:03:57,433 --> 00:03:59,999
I am so sorry, I..!

100
00:03:59,999 --> 00:04:00,999
There must be so many people

101
00:04:00,999 --> 00:04:02,516
Waiting to see Kiara

102
00:04:02,516 --> 00:04:02,966
I..!

103
00:04:02,966 --> 00:04:03,416
I, I..!

104
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:04,333
I saw this too late

105
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,166
And took 5 whole minutes!!

106
00:04:07,233 --> 00:04:10,316
Grand Bow

107
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:14,883
(Watching Kiara's Stream to Check)

108
00:04:14,883 --> 00:04:16,116
Is she watching me now?!

109
00:04:16,116 --> 00:04:18,799
Goseguuuuu~!!

110
00:04:20,716 --> 00:04:22,866
Hello~!

111
00:04:22,866 --> 00:04:24,399
Korean is hard..

112
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:27,883
Really really hard..

113
00:04:28,749 --> 00:04:30,849
We collabbed~!!

114
00:04:30,849 --> 00:04:33,149
We collabbed by watching each other's stream!

115
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:37,299
(Watching Again)

116
00:04:37,299 --> 00:04:38,649
She's watching again?!

117
00:04:41,966 --> 00:04:42,649
No..!

118
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:43,516
No!

119
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:44,583
Gosegu..!

120
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:45,983
No..!

121
00:04:45,983 --> 00:04:47,916
Ah! Gosegu~

122
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:50,066
Let's be friends-!

123
00:04:50,316 --> 00:04:52,333
And collaboration soon

124
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:52,783
OK?

125
00:04:54,016 --> 00:04:55,483
No way! Wait but

126
00:04:55,483 --> 00:04:59,149
For her to bring it up first is, really..

127
00:04:59,516 --> 00:05:00,833
You know....

128
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,983
I'm like..

129
00:05:02,983 --> 00:05:04,416
A nobody..!

130
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:05,549
Right..?

131
00:05:08,216 --> 00:05:08,799
From this point on

132
00:05:08,799 --> 00:05:09,883
(Starting now you are)
Ima kara anata wa

133
00:05:09,883 --> 00:05:11,683
(My angel desu)
Watashi no angeru desu

134
00:05:11,683 --> 00:05:14,349
She says she'll read Segu's wiki page?

135
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:20,416
Never

136
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:20,783
Never never

137
00:05:20,783 --> 00:05:21,150
Never never never

138
00:05:21,149 --> 00:05:21,316
Can't

139
00:05:21,316 --> 00:05:21,499
Can't can't

140
00:05:21,499 --> 00:05:21,699
Can't can't can't

141
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:21,966
Can't can't can't can't

142
00:05:22,183 --> 00:05:23,433
But isn't that..!

143
00:05:23,433 --> 00:05:25,033
Only in....

144
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,083
Only in.... Korean?

145
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:27,549
Did you see the EN wiki updating nicknames in real time
(There's already stuff being translated)

146
00:05:29,016 --> 00:05:30,349

Galtong (Daegaltong) looooooooool

155
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,383
Hey....

156
00:05:49,383 --> 00:05:50,899
Are you trash?!

157
00:05:50,899 --> 00:05:51,666
That's so mean

158
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,883
'Empty-headed' lol

159
00:05:53,883 --> 00:05:55,099
Nonsense

160
00:05:55,533 --> 00:05:58,916
Watching Kiara's Clips About Gosegu..

161
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,449
I'm so happy she-

162
00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:01,733
She, she's interested now

163
00:06:01,733 --> 00:06:02,783
Because in the beginning

164
00:06:02,783 --> 00:06:04,699
You know, I followed her first on Twitter

165
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:06,799
'Cause I saw her reacting to me on Twitch

166
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:08,266
So I thought "Oh OK~"

167
00:06:08,266 --> 00:06:13,066
She seems really happy about me...
even speaking very slightly about her

168
00:06:13,066 --> 00:06:14,749
So... I followed her

169
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:15,983
But then she didn't follow me back

170
00:06:15,983 --> 00:06:19,749
She reacted to me liking the tweet

171
00:06:19,749 --> 00:06:21,966
About her and writing to her

172
00:06:26,349 --> 00:06:28,449
I was very embarrassed about it

173
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:31,066
"I was embarrassed"

174
00:06:31,066 --> 00:06:31,533
"I'm sorry"

175
00:06:31,533 --> 00:06:32,499
But she didn't follow me back

176
00:06:32,499 --> 00:06:33,466
So I was like, "eh?"

177
00:06:33,466 --> 00:06:35,199
"why? w- why, why? why??"

178
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,316
"Is she not interested?"

179
00:06:36,316 --> 00:06:37,616
And then I heard that

180
00:06:37,616 --> 00:06:38,783
(Houshou Marine)
Her oshi is Marine senpai

181
00:06:38,783 --> 00:06:40,449
And she said something about, like

182
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:42,683
Like, she can't possibly, like

183
00:06:42,683 --> 00:06:45,333
More or less use me to get to Marine

184
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:48,133
I'm glad that she wouldn't do that

185
00:06:53,733 --> 00:06:56,249
You would go that far..!

186
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,766
I'm such a piece of-!!

187
00:06:57,766 --> 00:07:00,149
I should have followed back immediately, no?!

188
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:03,433
(Boo trash)

189
00:07:03,433 --> 00:07:06,016
Making Kiara wait..

190
00:07:06,016 --> 00:07:08,933
For so long like this, then I am indeed trash..

191
00:07:09,299 --> 00:07:11,149
(Stream couple days later)

192
00:07:11,149 --> 00:07:13,016
OK let me give you a Gosegu update

193
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:15,983
So me and Gosegu have been discussing

194
00:07:15,983 --> 00:07:16,983
Collab ideas

195
00:07:16,983 --> 00:07:18,116
I threw like..

196
00:07:18,116 --> 00:07:20,966
4 different collab ideas at her

197
00:07:20,966 --> 00:07:22,283
And we'll see what sticks

198
00:07:22,283 --> 00:07:24,733
We'll combine them all, gattai!

199
00:07:24,733 --> 00:07:27,099
Kiara-san!

200
00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:29,333
Our secret conversation..!

201
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:30,433
On her stream..!

202
00:07:30,433 --> 00:07:32,066
She talked about it! lol

203
00:07:32,066 --> 00:07:34,283
I thought it was supposed to be a secret

204
00:07:34,283 --> 00:07:34,766
So I was like..!

205
00:07:34,766 --> 00:07:36,466
"What collab~"

00:07:36,466 --> 00:07:37,933
You know lmao

00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:41,499
