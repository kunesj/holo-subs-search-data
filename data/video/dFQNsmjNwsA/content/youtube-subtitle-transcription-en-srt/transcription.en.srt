387
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:08,230
red
red red

388
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:08,240
red red
 

389
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,509
red red
or red only

390
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:11,519
or red only
 

391
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,030
or red only
just read okay so that I'm gonna put

392
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:14,040
just read okay so that I'm gonna put
 

393
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,129
just read okay so that I'm gonna put
that to the

394
00:12:16,129 --> 00:12:16,139
that to the
 

395
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:18,769
that to the
one on like there's two two thingies

396
00:12:18,769 --> 00:12:18,779
one on like there's two two thingies
 

397
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,449
one on like there's two two thingies
where I can put it the one on the right

398
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:20,459
where I can put it the one on the right
 

399
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:21,470
where I can put it the one on the right
side and the one on the left side

400
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:21,480
side and the one on the left side
 

401
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,370
side and the one on the left side
connecting but I guess it no it's only I

402
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:25,380
connecting but I guess it no it's only I
 

403
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,730
connecting but I guess it no it's only I
don't know

404
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:28,740

 

405
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:41,509

um

406
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:41,519

 

407
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,490

um

408
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:45,500

 

409
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,509

so red only either connects to blue blue

410
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:49,519
so red only either connects to blue blue
 

411
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,889
so red only either connects to blue blue
or blue green

412
00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:51,899
or blue green
 

413
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:53,090
or blue green

528
00:15:39,889 --> 00:15:39,899

 

529
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:41,990

that's okay because uh we could just try

530
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:42,000
that's okay because uh we could just try
 

531
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,850
that's okay because uh we could just try
again and it'll be the same I guess when

532
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:43,860
again and it'll be the same I guess when
 

533
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,769
again and it'll be the same I guess when
you like start a new chapter when you

534
00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:45,779
you like start a new chapter when you
 

535
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,449
you like start a new chapter when you
start again from the beginning that it

536
00:15:47,449 --> 00:15:47,459
start again from the beginning that it
 

537
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:49,249
start again from the beginning that it
randomizes so it's not the same as last

538
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:49,259
randomizes so it's not the same as last
 

539
00:15:49,259 --> 00:15:53,810
randomizes so it's not the same as last
time oh no

540
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:53,820

 

541
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,150

but so now what

542
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:56,160
but so now what
 

543
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,710
but so now what
um I don't think it randomized again

544
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:57,720
um I don't think it randomized again
 

545
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,629
um I don't think it randomized again
probably right probably now it's still

546
00:15:59,629 --> 00:15:59,639
probably right probably now it's still
 

547
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:03,650
probably right probably now it's still
the same as the previous try

548
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:03,660

 

549
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,350

probably hopefully

550
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:06,360
probably hopefully
 

551
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,269
probably hopefully
yeah yeah it'll be the same as the one

552
00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:08,279
yeah yeah it'll be the same as the one
 

553
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:10,370
yeah yeah it'll be the same as the one
we just tried so it doesn't work on the

554
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:10,380
we just tried so it doesn't work on the
 

555
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,050
we just tried so it doesn't work on the
end where like

556
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:12,060
end where like
 

557
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,910
end where like
um it goes

558
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:13,920
um it goes
 

559
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,129
um it goes
I don't know my mood doesn't work after

560
00:16:16,129 --> 00:16:16,139
I don't know my mood doesn't work after
 

561
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:17,870
I don't know my mood doesn't work after
orange so maybe it has to be a different

562
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:17,880
orange so maybe it has to be a different
 

563
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,889
orange so maybe it has to be a different
one because uh yeah to go after that

564
00:16:20,889 --> 00:16:20,899
one because uh yeah to go after that
 

565
00:16:20,899 --> 00:16:24,710
one because uh yeah to go after that
wait okay so uh

566
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:24,720
wait okay so uh
 

567
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,949
wait okay so uh
what what was connected with uh with uh

568
00:16:27,949 --> 00:16:27,959
what what was connected with uh with uh
 

569
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:31,910
what what was connected with uh with uh
orange green again sorry

570
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:31,920

 

571
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,569

either orange blue or blue green orange

572
00:16:35,569 --> 00:16:35,579
either orange blue or blue green orange
 

573
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:37,790
either orange blue or blue green orange
blue orange blue a blue green I don't

574
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:37,800
blue orange blue a blue green I don't
 

575
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,449
blue orange blue a blue green I don't
know

576
00:16:38,449 --> 00:16:38,459
know
 

577
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:40,490
know
I don't know okay orange but what did I

578
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:40,500
I don't know okay orange but what did I
 

579
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,509
I don't know okay orange but what did I
use the first time

580
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:43,519

 

581
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,829

and what was connected to Blue only

582
00:16:48,829 --> 00:16:48,839

 

583
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:55,490

uh just orange sorry just Red Green

584
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:55,500

 

585
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,170

so does that mean that this would go

586
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:57,180
so does that mean that this would go
 

587
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:00,110
so does that mean that this would go
here

588
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:00,120

 

589
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,769

I mean is this what I just did before

590
00:17:03,769 --> 00:17:03,779
I mean is this what I just did before
 

591
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:06,069
I mean is this what I just did before
I guess I could also go to single orange

592
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:06,079
I guess I could also go to single orange
 

593
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,069
I guess I could also go to single orange
okay uh I'm testing

594
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:10,079
okay uh I'm testing
 

595
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,409
okay uh I'm testing
it looks like up until there it's

596
00:17:12,409 --> 00:17:12,419
it looks like up until there it's
 

597
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:14,569
it looks like up until there it's
working

598
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:14,579
working
 

599
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:17,569
working
so what connects one more time uh with

600
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:17,579
so what connects one more time uh with
 

601
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:20,870
so what connects one more time uh with
uh orange and green

602
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:20,880

 

603
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,470

uh either single red blue green

604
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:24,480
uh either single red blue green
 

605
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,289
uh either single red blue green
or a single Orange

606
00:17:27,289 --> 00:17:27,299
or a single Orange
 

607
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:29,870
or a single Orange
so last time I did orange I think I know

608
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:29,880
so last time I did orange I think I know
 

609
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,510
so last time I did orange I think I know
it worked right

610
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:32,520
it worked right
 

611
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,590
it worked right
no let me see

612
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:35,600
no let me see
 

613
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:43,310
no let me see
uh testing

614
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:43,320

 

615
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,289

it has to connect to two things yeah I

616
00:17:45,289 --> 00:17:45,299
it has to connect to two things yeah I
 

617
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:47,450
it has to connect to two things yeah I
know I know okay but this is working I

618
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:47,460
know I know okay but this is working I
 

619
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,070
know I know okay but this is working I
just need to figure out this one and not

620
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:49,080
just need to figure out this one and not
 

621
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,169
just need to figure out this one and not
die again okay I think until that point

622
00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:51,179
die again okay I think until that point
 

623
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:53,510
die again okay I think until that point
it worked again

624
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:53,520
it worked again
 

625
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:58,789
it worked again
uh the last time I put in uh

626
00:17:58,789 --> 00:17:58,799
uh the last time I put in uh
 

627
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,070
uh the last time I put in uh
the remaining

628
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:01,080
the remaining
 

629
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,169
the remaining
which one did I put in white connects to

630
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:03,179
which one did I put in white connects to
 

631
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:07,450
which one did I put in white connects to
red and blue red blue

632
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:07,460

 

633
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:11,870

uh blue blue or blue orange okay and I

634
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:11,880
uh blue blue or blue orange okay and I
 

635
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,049
uh blue blue or blue orange okay and I
used blue blue and I died so but I don't

636
00:18:15,049 --> 00:18:15,059
used blue blue and I died so but I don't
 

637
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:17,810
used blue blue and I died so but I don't
have the other one that you said

638
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:17,820
have the other one that you said
 

639
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:21,650
have the other one that you said
so what the hell

640
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:21,660

 

641
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,570

I think that I died I think I was the

642
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:23,580
I think that I died I think I was the
 

643
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,950
I think that I died I think I was the
one who died because I was standing in

644
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:24,960
one who died because I was standing in
 

645
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,950
one who died because I was standing in
the water over here when it uh went oh

646
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:27,960
the water over here when it uh went oh
 

647
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,870
the water over here when it uh went oh
oh

648
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:28,880
oh
 

649
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,250
oh
okay you mean that was a timeout okay

650
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:34,260

 

651
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,590

does she mean that did I really want to

652
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:36,600
does she mean that did I really want to
 

653
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,049
does she mean that did I really want to
have time okay testing testing it didn't

654
00:18:39,049 --> 00:18:39,059
have time okay testing testing it didn't
 

655
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:40,430
have time okay testing testing it didn't
look like it was that close to the

656
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:40,440
look like it was that close to the
 

657
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,770
look like it was that close to the
ground though

658
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:42,780
ground though
 

659
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,450
ground though
okay

660
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:44,460
okay
 

661
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,029
okay
then that was really bad timing

662
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:47,039
then that was really bad timing
 

663
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:51,110
then that was really bad timing
no what do we what do we get come on

664
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,120

 

665
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,090

oh

666
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:55,100

 

667
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,730

yay

668
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:57,740
yay
 

669
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:02,750
yay
that was fairly fast thankfully

670
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:02,760

 

671
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,090

that's because of our two big brains put

672
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:05,100
that's because of our two big brains put
 

673
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,669
that's because of our two big brains put
together which will now disappear and

674
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:07,679
together which will now disappear and
 

675
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,750
together which will now disappear and
become a no-brainer

676
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:11,760

 

677
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,070

which actually shouldn't not be

678
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:13,080
which actually shouldn't not be
 

679
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,230
which actually shouldn't not be
something good

680
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:15,240
something good
 

681
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,070
something good
we gotta make a concoction here I think

682
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:18,080
we gotta make a concoction here I think
 

683
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,070
we gotta make a concoction here I think
Watson concoction

684
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:22,080

 

685
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,970

oh God this looks complicated

686
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:25,980
oh God this looks complicated
 

687
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:29,330
oh God this looks complicated
and we we stopped here last time

688
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:29,340
and we we stopped here last time
 

689
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,490
and we we stopped here last time
oh you know what I think it is is

690
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:31,500
oh you know what I think it is is
 

691
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,409
oh you know what I think it is is
because this technically isn't part of a

692
00:19:33,409 --> 00:19:33,419
because this technically isn't part of a
 

693
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:35,210
because this technically isn't part of a
new chapter it's like part of the same

694
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:35,220
new chapter it's like part of the same
 

695
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,870
new chapter it's like part of the same
chapter yeah probably

696
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:37,880
chapter yeah probably
 

697
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,789
chapter yeah probably
where do I go

698
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:40,799
where do I go
 

699
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,529

00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:03,350
not red
and I try I'm trying to connect it

1054
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:03,360
and I try I'm trying to connect it
 

1055
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,769
and I try I'm trying to connect it
that's that it goes to the the barrels

1056
00:29:06,769 --> 00:29:06,779
that's that it goes to the the barrels
 

1057
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:08,630
that's that it goes to the the barrels
because like the tubes the pipes they

1058
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:08,640
because like the tubes the pipes they
 

1059
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,889
because like the tubes the pipes they
are kind of connected to the barrels

1060
00:29:11,889 --> 00:29:11,899
are kind of connected to the barrels
 

1061
00:29:11,899 --> 00:29:15,470
are kind of connected to the barrels
and but yeah I think I have to try

1062
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:15,480
and but yeah I think I have to try
 

1063
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,570
and but yeah I think I have to try
around a little bit to make it

1064
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:17,580
around a little bit to make it
 

1065
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,669
around a little bit to make it
connect properly I guess

1066
00:29:19,669 --> 00:29:19,679

needs less leaks I mean there's one leak
 

1425
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,490
needs less leaks I mean there's one leak
um

um
 

1427
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,410
um
I add three barrels yes barrels and

pipes barrels and pipes free Barons that
have free colors one of them is purple

1432
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:15,540
have free colors one of them is purple
 

1433
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,630
have free colors one of them is purple
one of those orange and one of them is

1434
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:17,640
one of those orange and one of them is
 

1435
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,210
one of those orange and one of them is
green and I'm currently creating a

1436
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:20,220
green and I'm currently creating a
 

1437

purple flame
 

1439
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,109

uh that should

1440
00:38:24,109 --> 00:38:24,119
uh that should
 

1441
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:26,930
uh that should
I'll wait a second

1442
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:26,940
I'll wait a second
 

1443
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:30,230
I'll wait a second
no oh yeah that it should it should go

1444
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:30,240
no oh yeah that it should it should go
 

1445
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,089
no oh yeah that it should it should go
it should connect to the barrel and then

1446
00:38:32,089 --> 00:38:32,099
it should connect to the barrel and then
 

1447
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:34,190
it should connect to the barrel and then
fill it up I suppose but

1448
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:34,200
fill it up I suppose but
 

1449
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,069
fill it up I suppose but
uh I have I have a leak somewhere I

1450
00:38:37,069 --> 00:38:37,079
uh I have I have a leak somewhere I
 

1451
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:40,250
uh I have I have a leak somewhere I
think

1452
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:40,260

 

1453
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,349

okay do you think the leak could be on

1454
00:38:42,349 --> 00:38:42,359
okay do you think the leak could be on
 

1455
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:44,470
okay do you think the leak could be on
my end since I also

1456
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:44,480
my end since I also
 

1457
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,390
my end since I also
uh yeah maybe I have a leak at number

1458
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:47,400
uh yeah maybe I have a leak at number
 

1459
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:51,770
uh yeah maybe I have a leak at number
one I guess

1460
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:51,780

 

1461
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:55,250

after that I'm on my way okay

1462
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:55,260
after that I'm on my way okay
 

1463
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,550
after that I'm on my way okay
can she connect that

1464
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:56,560

um and I can turn the pipes

1568
00:41:29,089 --> 00:41:29,099
um and I can turn the pipes
 

1569
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:32,870
um and I can turn the pipes
so that pipes get connected in in the

1570
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:32,880
so that pipes get connected in in the
 

1571
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,349
so that pipes get connected in in the
right way I guess

1572
00:41:35,349 --> 00:41:35,359
right way I guess
 

1573
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,609
right way I guess
and uh

1574
00:41:37,609 --> 00:41:37,619
and uh
 

1575
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:38,870
and uh
then

1576
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:38,880
then
 

1577
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,089
then
in some way at some point they should

1578
00:41:41,089 --> 00:41:41,099
in some way at some point they should
 

1579
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:43,250
in some way at some point they should
lead up to the barrels and fill the

1580
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:43,260
lead up to the barrels and fill the
 

1581
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,990
lead up to the barrels and fill the
barrels up

1582
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:45,000
barrels up
 

1583
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,450
barrels up
and also I have the two levers with

1584
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:47,460
and also I have the two levers with
 

1585
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,970
and also I have the two levers with
yellow and blue

1586
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:49,980
yellow and blue
 

1587
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:52,670
yellow and blue
does that make sense okay so can we

1588
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:52,680
does that make sense okay so can we
 

1589
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,109
does that make sense okay so can we
confirm like if we fill it with a

1590
00:41:54,109 --> 00:41:54,119
confirm like if we fill it with a
 

1591
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:56,270
confirm like if we fill it with a
certain color like if we

1592
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:56,280
certain color like if we
 

1593
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,490
certain color like if we
um contain all the leaks if it uh fills

1594
00:41:58,490 --> 00:41:58,500
um contain all the leaks if it uh fills
 

1595
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,809
um contain all the leaks if it uh fills
the barrel with like a certain color

1596
00:41:59,809 --> 00:41:59,819
the barrel with like a certain color
 

1597
00:41:59,819 --> 00:42:01,550
the barrel with like a certain color
liquid so that we can test because I

1598
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:01,560
liquid so that we can test because I
 

1599
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,010
liquid so that we can test because I
have juice on my side

1600
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:04,020
have juice on my side
 

1601
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,809
have juice on my side
juice

1602
00:42:05,809 --> 00:42:05,819
juice
 

1603
00:42:05,819 --> 00:42:08,569
juice
uh yeah for example when it was all

1604
00:42:08,569 --> 00:42:08,579
uh yeah for example when it was all
 

1605
00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:09,950
uh yeah for example when it was all
purple

1606
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:09,960
purple
 

1607
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,870
purple
um I was hoping for it to fill up the

1608
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:11,880
um I was hoping for it to fill up the
 

1609
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,450
um I was hoping for it to fill up the
purple Barrel but it's

1610
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:14,460
purple Barrel but it's
 

1611
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:15,470
purple Barrel but it's
um

1612
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:15,480
um
 

1613
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,870
um
didn't fill up because I guess something

1614
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:17,880
didn't fill up because I guess something
 

1615
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:23,170
didn't fill up because I guess something
is leaking

1616
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:23,180

 

1617
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:26,030

what is your way to identify the leaks

1618
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:26,040
what is your way to identify the leaks
 

1619
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,790
what is your way to identify the leaks
and maybe we could try again and then uh

1620
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:28,800
and maybe we could try again and then uh
 

1621
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,710
and maybe we could try again and then uh
press the lever and maybe that'll do

1622
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:30,720
press the lever and maybe that'll do
 

1623
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,609
press the lever and maybe that'll do
something

1624
00:42:31,609 --> 00:42:31,619
something
 

1625
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:34,190
something
um

1626
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:34,200

 

1627
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,630

um

1628
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:35,640
um
 

1629
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:39,230
um
my way to identify them is well I just

1630
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:39,240
my way to identify them is well I just
 

1631
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:43,970
my way to identify them is well I just
see it leaking

1632
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:43,980

 

1633
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:47,329

anything I've been pressing about no

1634
00:42:47,329 --> 00:42:47,339
anything I've been pressing about no
 

1635
00:42:47,339 --> 00:42:50,569
anything I've been pressing about no
no

1636
00:42:50,569 --> 00:42:50,579

 

1637
00:42:50,579 --> 00:42:52,490

okay

1638
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:52,500
okay
 

1639
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,470
okay
oh no

1640
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:54,480
oh no
 

1641
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,069
oh no
um

1642
00:42:57,069 --> 00:42:57,079

 

1643
00:42:57,079 --> 00:43:00,470

you turned on red I think

1644
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:00,480
you turned on red I think
 

1645
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,609
you turned on red I think
um

1646
00:43:01,609 --> 00:43:01,619
um
 

1647
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:04,430
um
okay I will

1648
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:04,440
okay I will
 

1649
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:07,730
okay I will
I will try again to make purple by by

1650
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:07,740
I will try again to make purple by by
 

1651
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:10,069
I will try again to make purple by by
turning off Yellow by by turning off

1652
00:43:10,069 --> 00:43:10,079
turning off Yellow by by turning off
 

1653
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:11,150
turning off Yellow by by turning off
yellow

1654
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:11,160
yellow
 

1655
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,550
yellow
which gives me a link though but

1656
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:13,560
which gives me a link though but
 

1657
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,050
which gives me a link though but
otherwise how am I supposed to make

1658
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:15,060
otherwise how am I supposed to make
 

1659
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:17,450
otherwise how am I supposed to make
purple if if yellow is on I need for

1660
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:17,460
purple if if yellow is on I need for
 

1661
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:20,210
purple if if yellow is on I need for
purple I need red and blue and you

1662
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:20,220
purple I need red and blue and you
 

1663
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:23,690
purple I need red and blue and you
activated red so I activated blue

1664
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:23,700
activated red so I activated blue
 

1665
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:26,630
activated red so I activated blue
and not yet now it's purple

1666
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:26,640
and not yet now it's purple
 

1667
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,150
and not yet now it's purple
let me just try over I'm just okay one

1668
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:29,160
let me just try over I'm just okay one
 

1669
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,770
let me just try over I'm just okay one
second I'm gonna try it all over I'm

1670
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:30,780
second I'm gonna try it all over I'm
 

1671
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:34,730
second I'm gonna try it all over I'm
gonna remove all the pieces

1672
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:34,740

 

1673
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:39,650

okay okay copy that

1674
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:39,660

 

1675
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:42,410

what if what if it's not supposed to go

1676
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:42,420
what if what if it's not supposed to go
 

1677
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:44,630
what if what if it's not supposed to go
straight

1678
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:44,640

 

1679
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,290

maybe that was the issue

1680
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:47,300
maybe that was the issue
 

1681
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:50,150
maybe that was the issue
uh what if it's supposed to go like no

1682
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:50,160
uh what if it's supposed to go like no
 

1683
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,010
uh what if it's supposed to go like no
that makes no sense no it has to go

1684
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:52,020
that makes no sense no it has to go
 

1685
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:54,069
that makes no sense no it has to go
straight

1686
00:43:54,069 --> 00:43:54,079
straight
 

1687
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:57,349
straight
that makes no sense otherwise

1688
00:43:57,349 --> 00:43:57,359
that makes no sense otherwise
 

1689
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:01,190
that makes no sense otherwise
okay so what if

1690
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:01,200
okay so what if
 

1691
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,829
okay so what if
I sent this one didn't I do that already

1692
00:44:03,829 --> 00:44:03,839
I sent this one didn't I do that already
 

1693
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:06,530
I sent this one didn't I do that already
I've said I sent this one uh oh wait

1694
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:06,540
I've said I sent this one uh oh wait
 

1695
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:15,530
I've said I sent this one uh oh wait
does it what if I send it downwards

1696
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:15,540

 

1697
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:22,069

oh

1698
00:44:22,069 --> 00:44:22,079

 

1699
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:23,930

let's see it

1700
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:23,940
let's see it
 

1701
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:25,670
let's see it
well it comes from below when it comes

1702
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:25,680
well it comes from below when it comes
 

1703
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,670
well it comes from below when it comes
from

1704
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:28,680

 

1705
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:37,309

from the left well how about this

1706
00:44:37,309 --> 00:44:37,319

 

1707
00:44:37,319 --> 00:44:40,790

sending it downward sends it to Ahmed

1708
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:40,800
sending it downward sends it to Ahmed
 

1709
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,210
sending it downward sends it to Ahmed

[Music]
 

1711
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:47,150
[Music]
why is it leaking from there did she do

1712
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:47,160
why is it leaking from there did she do
 

1713
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,710
why is it leaking from there did she do
something

1714
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:48,720
something
 

1715
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,890
something
let me remove that it comes from then I

1716
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:51,900
let me remove that it comes from then I
 

1717
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:55,250
let me remove that it comes from then I
come from above before

1718
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:55,260

 

1719
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:58,069

what about now

1720
00:44:58,069 --> 00:44:58,079
what about now
 

1721
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:00,950
what about now
no and now it makes from above wait is

1722
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:00,960
no and now it makes from above wait is
 

1723
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,270
no and now it makes from above wait is
that because

1724
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:02,280
that because
 

1725
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,530
that because
well

1726
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:03,540
well
 

1727
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:07,430
well
wait a second it it comes from left

1728
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:07,440
wait a second it it comes from left
 

1729
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:12,290
wait a second it it comes from left
and below below is below comes from here

1730
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:12,300
and below below is below comes from here
 

1731
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,809
and below below is below comes from here
yeah okay that makes sense and from the

1732
00:45:14,809 --> 00:45:14,819
yeah okay that makes sense and from the
 

1733
00:45:14,819 --> 00:45:16,670
yeah okay that makes sense and from the
left it comes from

1734
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:16,680
left it comes from
 

1735
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:21,950
left it comes from
here but here we have the leak

1736
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:21,960

 

1737
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:25,730

I'm a ninja anywhere in your vicinity do

1738

one way connector in there I think that

2070
00:53:11,329 --> 00:53:11,339
one way connector in there I think that
 

2071
00:53:11,339 --> 00:53:13,430
one way connector in there I think that
will do it because I guess it's like

2072
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:13,440
will do it because I guess it's like
 

2073
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,950
will do it because I guess it's like

um let's just go to the first part

2526
01:05:44,329 --> 01:05:44,339

 

2527
01:05:44,339 --> 01:05:47,870

copy that let's let's do one pipe at a

2528
01:05:47,870 --> 01:05:47,880
copy that let's let's do one pipe at a
 

2529
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:49,609
copy that let's let's do one pipe at a
time so I think the first one I'm

2530
01:05:49,609 --> 01:05:49,619
time so I think the first one I'm
 

2531
01:05:49,619 --> 01:05:52,490
time so I think the first one I'm
putting actually has to be correct

2532
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:52,500
putting actually has to be correct
 

2533
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:54,770

all right so I have red coming in from

all right so I have red coming in from
 

2547
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,069
all right so I have red coming in from
the left connector which can be

2548
01:06:10,069 --> 01:06:10,079
the left connector which can be
 

2549
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:11,750
the left connector which can be
connected to the three other connectors

2550
01:06:11,750 --> 01:06:11,760
connected to the three other connectors
 

2551
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:14,990
connected to the three other connectors
and uh at the bottom connector it would

2552
01:06:14,990 --> 01:06:15,000
and uh at the bottom connector it would
 

2553
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,230
and uh at the bottom connector it would
ignite One Flame at the top connector it

2554
01:06:18,230 --> 01:06:18,240
ignite One Flame at the top connector it
 

2555
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,210
ignite One Flame at the top connector it
ignites two Flames but it still comes

01:06:20,210 --> 01:06:20,220
ignites two Flames but it still comes
 

2557
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:22,250
ignites two Flames but it still comes

I have a pressure meter and

2990
01:18:30,050 --> 01:18:30,060
I have a pressure meter and
 

2991
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:31,850
I have a pressure meter and
um now it's in the middle now it's going

2992
01:18:31,850 --> 01:18:31,860
um now it's in the middle now it's going
 

2993
01:18:31,860 --> 01:18:33,229
um now it's in the middle now it's going
below the middle now it's changed to

2994
01:18:33,229 --> 01:18:33,239
below the middle now it's changed to
 

2995
01:18:33,239 --> 01:18:34,490
below the middle now it's changed to
below the middle I need it to be higher

2996
01:18:34,490 --> 01:18:34,500
below the middle I need it to be higher
 

2997
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:36,350
below the middle I need it to be higher
I needed to be at the maximum now it's

2998
01:18:36,350 --> 01:18:36,360
I needed to be at the maximum now it's
 

2999
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:39,050
I needed to be at the maximum now it's
like at the middle now

3000
01:18:39,050 --> 01:18:39,060
like at the middle now
 

3001
01:18:39,060 --> 01:18:42,530
like at the middle now
uh now it's at the middle

3002
01:18:42,530 --> 01:18:42,540
uh now it's at the middle
 

3003
01:18:42,540 --> 01:18:47,149
uh now it's at the middle
so I need it to be at maximum pressure

3004
01:18:47,149 --> 01:18:47,159
so I need it to be at maximum pressure
 

3005
01:18:47,159 --> 01:18:47,870
so I need it to be at maximum pressure
um

3007
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:50,450

then it will fill up the barrels if I

3008
01:18:50,450 --> 01:18:50,460
then it will fill up the barrels if I
 

3009
01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:54,110
then it will fill up the barrels if I
understand correctly I think I do so

3010
01:18:54,110 --> 01:18:54,120
understand correctly I think I do so
 

3011

01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:03,540

 

3015
01:19:03,540 --> 01:19:11,390

uh there is a leak at one again

3016
01:19:11,390 --> 01:19:11,400

 

3017
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:15,890

um and the the red one that you sent

3018
01:19:15,890 --> 01:19:15,900
um and the the red one that you sent
 

3019
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:17,689

um I think
 

3025
01:19:23,659 --> 01:19:26,990
um I think
can you send the red one only for one

3026
01:19:26,990 --> 01:19:27,000
can you send the red one only for one
 

3027
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,990
can you send the red one only for one
and three right

3028
01:19:29,990 --> 01:19:30,000

 

3029
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,050

only three one and three

3030
01:19:32,050 --> 01:19:32,060
only three one and three
 

3031
01:19:32,060 --> 01:19:35,450
only three one and three
do you have any other way to send the

3032
01:19:35,450 --> 01:19:35,460
do you have any other way to send the
 

3033
01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:38,510
do you have any other way to send the
red one besides through one and three

3034
01:19:38,510 --> 01:19:38,520
red one besides through one and three
 

3035
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:40,310
red one besides through one and three
I can't get it to three because if I

3036
01:19:40,310 --> 01:19:40,320
I can't get it to three because if I
 

3037
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:49,750
I can't get it to three because if I
send it only two well yes

how's the pressure

3510
01:32:28,930 --> 01:32:28,940
how's the pressure
 

3511
01:32:28,940 --> 01:32:33,290
how's the pressure
uh it's like a tiny bit above middle

3512
01:32:33,290 --> 01:32:33,300
uh it's like a tiny bit above middle

01:32:33,300 --> 01:32:34,790
uh it's like a tiny bit above middle
and I think

3514

and I think
 

3515
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:38,090
and I think
uh the two doesn't really lead anywhere

3516
01:32:38,090 --> 01:32:38,100
uh the two doesn't really lead anywhere
 

3517
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:41,990
uh the two doesn't really lead anywhere
for me so the two is unnecessary yeah

3541
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:21,410

okay I do have a leak um

3542
01:33:21,410 --> 01:33:21,420
okay I do have a leak um
 

3543
01:33:21,420 --> 01:33:22,790
okay I do have a leak um
where

3544
01:33:22,790 --> 01:33:22,800
where
 

3545
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:24,470
where
it doesn't help if I send it through two

3546
01:33:24,470 --> 01:33:24,480
it doesn't help if I send it through two
 

3547
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:26,450
it doesn't help if I send it through two
because then it makes it leak on your

3548
01:33:26,450 --> 01:33:26,460
because then it makes it leak on your
 

3549
01:33:26,460 --> 01:33:27,229
