A while ago, Red got a shutout against Red and White,

White, who was shut out, and
 

1128

White, who was shut out, and
Yellow, who has a 2-to-1 advantage over Red, can

1129
00:40:59,810 --> 00:40:59,820
Yellow, who has a 2-to-1 advantage over Red, can
 

1130
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,430
Yellow, who has a 2-to-1 advantage over Red, can
certainly compete to some extent. That's

1131
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:03,470
certainly compete to some extent. That's
 

1132
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:03,480

 

1133
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:07,130

3142
01:53:28,850 --> 01:53:28,860

 

3143
01:53:28,860 --> 01:53:32,450

can see the lag.  I felt like it would

3144

can see the lag.  I felt like it would
 

3145
01:53:32,460 --> 01:53:33,890
can see the lag.  I felt like it would
n't be possible for everyone to do it together,

3146
01:53:33,890 --> 01:53:33,900
n't be possible for everyone to do it together,
 

3147
01:53:33,900 --> 01:53:35,470
n't be possible for everyone to do it together,

Well, since we're having a sports day with Minecraft, I've

3238
01:56:01,430 --> 01:56:01,440
Well, since we're having a sports day with Minecraft, I've
 

3239
01:56:01,440 --> 01:56:04,790
Well, since we're having a sports day with Minecraft, I've
always wanted to make a competitive game with Minecraft elements,

3243
01:56:07,619 --> 01:56:10,370
and this year I think we've
finally managed to create a game that makes full use of Minecraft.  I

3244
01:56:10,370 --> 01:56:12,350
finally managed to create a game that makes full use of Minecraft.  I

3246
01:56:12,360 --> 01:56:15,169

think this is a very well-planned competition, and

3247
01:56:15,169 --> 01:56:18,050
think this is a very well-planned competition, and
 

3248
01:56:18,050 --> 01:56:18,060

 

3249
01:56:18,060 --> 01:56:22,189

4003
02:22:38,570 --> 02:22:38,580
gold team has 108 points, so I
 

4004
02:22:38,580 --> 02:22:41,469
gold team has 108 points, so I

02:22:46,550 --> 02:22:46,560
ranking will be a little bit 2nd or 3rd.  I feel
 

4010
02:22:46,560 --> 02:22:48,530
ranking will be a little bit 2nd or 3rd.  I feel
like it's going to change, but it's
