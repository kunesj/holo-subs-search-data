01:44:10,239 --> 01:44:11,870
year before a year or so maybe it was a
little before when Advent debuted I

01:44:13,390 --> 01:44:13,400
thought to myself there's really kind of
 

4511
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:16,229
thought to myself there's really kind of
no real reason for me to continue being

4512
01:44:16,229 --> 01:44:16,239
no real reason for me to continue being

here besides help other people right
um and I'm a person that like if if I

4516
01:44:23,229 --> 01:44:23,239
um and I'm a person that like if if I
 

4517
01:44:23,239 --> 01:44:24,790
um and I'm a person that like if if I
don't have worth

4518
01:44:24,790 --> 01:44:24,800
don't have worth
 

4519
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:28,229
don't have worth
somewhere I don't really feel like like

4520
01:44:28,229 --> 01:44:28,239
somewhere I don't really feel like like
 

4521
01:44:28,239 --> 01:44:30,149
somewhere I don't really feel like like
there's a point for me to exist anymore

4522
01:44:30,149 --> 01:44:30,159
there's a point for me to exist anymore
 

4523
01:44:30,159 --> 01:44:31,950
there's a point for me to exist anymore
if that makes any sense I feel like I

4524
01:44:31,950 --> 01:44:31,960
if that makes any sense I feel like I
 

4525
01:44:31,960 --> 01:44:34,950
if that makes any sense I feel like I
need to have something that I'm doing

4526
01:44:34,950 --> 01:44:34,960
need to have something that I'm doing
 

4527
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:36,709
need to have something that I'm doing
some reason for being not just lying

4528
01:44:36,709 --> 01:44:36,719
some reason for being not just lying
 

4529
01:44:36,719 --> 01:44:39,229
some reason for being not just lying
around and doing nothing watching

4530
01:44:39,229 --> 01:44:39,239
around and doing nothing watching
 

4531
01:44:39,239 --> 01:44:42,270
around and doing nothing watching
watching TV you know on the sofa with a

4532
01:44:42,270 --> 01:44:42,280
watching TV you know on the sofa with a
 

4533
01:44:42,280 --> 01:44:45,030
watching TV you know on the sofa with a
40 or something like that and so I

4534
01:44:45,030 --> 01:44:45,040
40 or something like that and so I
 

4535
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:48,310
40 or something like that and so I
decided that um even if doing something

4536
01:44:48,310 --> 01:44:48,320
decided that um even if doing something
 

4537
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:50,350
decided that um even if doing something
like making making really good music

4538
01:44:50,350 --> 01:44:50,360
like making making really good music
 

4539
01:44:50,360 --> 01:44:51,750
like making making really good music
that everybody can enjoy is something

4540
01:44:51,750 --> 01:44:51,760
that everybody can enjoy is something
 

4541
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:54,589
that everybody can enjoy is something
that I can't do um then maybe what I do

4542
01:44:54,589 --> 01:44:54,599
that I can't do um then maybe what I do
 

4543
01:44:54,599 --> 01:44:57,109
that I can't do um then maybe what I do
instead is help other people who can do

4544
01:44:57,109 --> 01:44:57,119
instead is help other people who can do
 

4545
01:44:57,119 --> 01:44:59,709
instead is help other people who can do
that right and so I decided I'm just

4546
01:44:59,709 --> 01:44:59,719
that right and so I decided I'm just
 

4547
01:44:59,719 --> 01:45:01,430
that right and so I decided I'm just
going to be a really good Senpai and

4548
01:45:01,430 --> 01:45:01,440
going to be a really good Senpai and
