7574
03:13:44,429 --> 03:13:44,439
you're small doesn't mean you don't have
 

7575
03:13:44,439 --> 03:13:47,469
you're small doesn't mean you don't have

7579
03:13:50,720 --> 03:13:53,550

like poking out like mine but you still

7580
03:13:53,550 --> 03:13:53,560
like poking out like mine but you still
 

7581
03:13:53,560 --> 03:13:55,670
like poking out like mine but you still
have a breast but we're we're still

7582
03:13:55,670 --> 03:13:55,680
have a breast but we're we're still
 

7583
03:13:55,680 --> 03:13:58,830
have a breast but we're we're still
breasties sure sure sure sure mhm it's

7584
03:13:58,830 --> 03:13:58,840
breasties sure sure sure sure mhm it's
 

7585
03:13:58,840 --> 03:14:02,670
breasties sure sure sure sure mhm it's
totally possible and imagine if I had

7586
03:14:02,670 --> 03:14:02,680
totally possible and imagine if I had
 

7587
03:14:02,680 --> 03:14:05,550
totally possible and imagine if I had
larger breast then if we were hugging

7588
03:14:05,550 --> 03:14:05,560
larger breast then if we were hugging
 

7589
03:14:05,560 --> 03:14:07,309
larger breast then if we were hugging
they would get in the way and I wouldn't

7590
03:14:07,309 --> 03:14:07,319
they would get in the way and I wouldn't
 

7591
03:14:07,319 --> 03:14:09,269
they would get in the way and I wouldn't
be as close to you you know no not

7592
03:14:09,269 --> 03:14:09,279
be as close to you you know no not
 

7593
03:14:09,279 --> 03:14:11,950
be as close to you you know no not
necessarily because your breast would be

7594
03:14:11,950 --> 03:14:11,960
necessarily because your breast would be
 

7595
03:14:11,960 --> 03:14:15,190
necessarily because your breast would be
situated lower than mine

7596
03:14:15,190 --> 03:14:15,200
situated lower than mine
 

7597
03:14:15,200 --> 03:14:19,110
situated lower than mine
so it would be like a puzzle piece that

7598
03:14:19,110 --> 03:14:19,120
so it would be like a puzzle piece that
 

7599
03:14:19,120 --> 03:14:22,349
so it would be like a puzzle piece that
is true but if we were like sitting down

7600
03:14:22,349 --> 03:14:22,359
is true but if we were like sitting down
 

7601
03:14:22,359 --> 03:14:24,510
is true but if we were like sitting down
and hugging they would keep us from each

7602
03:14:24,510 --> 03:14:24,520
and hugging they would keep us from each
 

7603
03:14:24,520 --> 03:14:26,830
and hugging they would keep us from each
other but who really does that our

7604
03:14:26,830 --> 03:14:26,840
other but who really does that our
 

7605
03:14:26,840 --> 03:14:28,750
other but who really does that our
problem is that when you're hugging me

7606
03:14:28,750 --> 03:14:28,760
problem is that when you're hugging me
 

7607
03:14:28,760 --> 03:14:32,469
problem is that when you're hugging me

theory already could listen to the
 

9159
03:53:18,040 --> 03:53:20,389
theory already could listen to the
capella if you just listen to the bot

9160

capella if you just listen to the bot
 

9161

but um that's why I thought oh maybe I
 

9165
03:53:26,040 --> 03:53:27,630
but um that's why I thought oh maybe I
should add a video to it to make it a

9166
03:53:27,630 --> 03:53:27,640
should add a video to it to make it a
 

9167
03:53:27,640 --> 03:53:30,389
should add a video to it to make it a
little bit more

9168
03:53:30,389 --> 03:53:30,399

 

9169
03:53:30,399 --> 03:53:35,070

special so yeah uh a little simple video

9170
03:53:35,070 --> 03:53:35,080
special so yeah uh a little simple video
 

9171
03:53:35,080 --> 03:53:39,630
special so yeah uh a little simple video
and then the coolest thing I realized

9172
03:53:39,630 --> 03:53:39,640
and then the coolest thing I realized
 

9173
03:53:39,640 --> 03:53:42,070
and then the coolest thing I realized
yesterday I mean actually I didn't

03:53:45,510 --> 03:53:45,520
realize uh both chy and and Sian pointed
 

9177
03:53:45,520 --> 03:53:50,510
realize uh both chy and and Sian pointed
out to me that the um software that I'm

9178
03:53:50,510 --> 03:53:50,520
out to me that the um software that I'm
 

9179
03:53:50,520 --> 03:53:51,469
out to me that the um software that I'm
using

9180
03:53:51,469 --> 03:53:51,479
using
 

9181
03:53:51,479 --> 03:53:55,830
using

normally so when I record in the xense

9184
03:54:00,030 --> 03:54:00,040
normally so when I record in the xense
 

9185
03:54:00,040 --> 03:54:04,469
normally so when I record in the xense
software uh I just like uh record like

9186
03:54:04,469 --> 03:54:04,479
software uh I just like uh record like
 

9187
03:54:04,479 --> 03:54:06,269
software uh I just like uh record like
the bones and stuff you know the bones

9188
03:54:06,269 --> 03:54:06,279
the bones and stuff you know the bones
 

9189
03:54:06,279 --> 03:54:09,429
the bones and stuff you know the bones
movement and in the software I'm not

9190
03:54:09,429 --> 03:54:09,439
movement and in the software I'm not
 

9191
03:54:09,439 --> 03:54:12,070
movement and in the software I'm not
myself I'm just like a bone skeleton

9192
03:54:12,070 --> 03:54:12,080
myself I'm just like a bone skeleton
 

9193
03:54:12,080 --> 03:54:15,229
myself I'm just like a bone skeleton
moving around can you imagine

9194
03:54:15,229 --> 03:54:15,239
moving around can you imagine
 

9195
03:54:15,239 --> 03:54:17,269
moving around can you imagine
and all that is being recorded is the

9196
03:54:17,269 --> 03:54:17,279
and all that is being recorded is the
 

9197
03:54:17,279 --> 03:54:19,910
and all that is being recorded is the
motion and then uh chagy gets that

9198
03:54:19,910 --> 03:54:19,920
motion and then uh chagy gets that
 

9199
03:54:19,920 --> 03:54:22,070
motion and then uh chagy gets that
motion and puts it onto my model because

9200
03:54:22,070 --> 03:54:22,080
motion and puts it onto my model because
 

9201
03:54:22,080 --> 03:54:24,950
motion and puts it onto my model because
I legitimately don't know how to do it

9202
03:54:24,950 --> 03:54:24,960
I legitimately don't know how to do it
 

9203
03:54:24,960 --> 03:54:27,309
I legitimately don't know how to do it
that's why I always need che's help and

9204
03:54:27,309 --> 03:54:27,319
that's why I always need che's help and
 

9205
03:54:27,319 --> 03:54:29,429
that's why I always need che's help and
chy puts it on the model and then

9206
03:54:29,429 --> 03:54:29,439
chy puts it on the model and then
 

9207
03:54:29,439 --> 03:54:31,229
chy puts it on the model and then
there's some jankiness here and there so

9208
03:54:31,229 --> 03:54:31,239
there's some jankiness here and there so
 

9209
03:54:31,239 --> 03:54:34,389
there's some jankiness here and there so
he like cleans up the jankiness That's

9210
03:54:34,389 --> 03:54:34,399
he like cleans up the jankiness That's
 

9211
03:54:34,399 --> 03:54:35,990
he like cleans up the jankiness That's
What chy

9212
03:54:35,990 --> 03:54:36,000
What chy
 

9213
03:54:36,000 --> 03:54:39,670
What chy
does um chy does not do Moab because chy

9214
03:54:39,670 --> 03:54:39,680
does um chy does not do Moab because chy
 

9215
03:54:39,680 --> 03:54:41,309
does um chy does not do Moab because chy
does not have any

03:54:41,309 --> 03:54:41,319
does not have any
 

9217
03:54:41,319 --> 03:54:43,990
does not have any
Moab equipment whatsoever but maybe it

9218
03:54:43,990 --> 03:54:44,000
Moab equipment whatsoever but maybe it
 

9219
03:54:44,000 --> 03:54:47,910
Moab equipment whatsoever but maybe it
would be cool maybe for chy to one

9220
03:54:47,910 --> 03:54:47,920
would be cool maybe for chy to one
 

9221
03:54:47,920 --> 03:54:51,389
would be cool maybe for chy to one
day you know get some would be surely

9222
03:54:51,389 --> 03:54:51,399
day you know get some would be surely
 

9223
03:54:51,399 --> 03:54:53,710
day you know get some would be surely
interesting I don't know if chy wants

9224
03:54:53,710 --> 03:54:53,720
interesting I don't know if chy wants
 

9225
03:54:53,720 --> 03:54:55,790

is a I don't know is there a way I I

9232
03:55:04,710 --> 03:55:04,720
is a I don't know is there a way I I
 

9233

what I what I'm recording in
 

9245
03:55:23,760 --> 03:55:25,790
what I what I'm recording in
xense and then you have to like link it

9246

xense and then you have to like link it
 

9247
03:55:25,800 --> 03:55:27,070
xense and then you have to like link it
up and I don't even know how to do that

fbx um and so it's like if I were to

9294
03:56:31,870 --> 03:56:31,880
fbx um and so it's like if I were to
 

9295
03:56:31,880 --> 03:56:34,950
fbx um and so it's like if I were to
just like like in my streams right in my

9296
03:56:34,950 --> 03:56:34,960
just like like in my streams right in my
 

9297
03:56:34,960 --> 03:56:37,389
just like like in my streams right in my
3D streams obviously my face is moving

9298
03:56:37,389 --> 03:56:37,399
3D streams obviously my face is moving
 

9299
03:56:37,399 --> 03:56:38,950
3D streams obviously my face is moving
obviously my body is moving it's already

9300
03:56:38,950 --> 03:56:38,960
obviously my body is moving it's already
 

9301
03:56:38,960 --> 03:56:41,389
obviously my body is moving it's already
combined there and so you would think

9302
03:56:41,389 --> 03:56:41,399
combined there and so you would think
 

9303
03:56:41,399 --> 03:56:43,229
combined there and so you would think
maybe oh why don't you just record that

9304
03:56:43,229 --> 03:56:43,239
maybe oh why don't you just record that
 

9305
03:56:43,239 --> 03:56:45,950
maybe oh why don't you just record that
it's different that's that's just like

9306
03:56:45,950 --> 03:56:45,960
it's different that's that's just like
 

9307
03:56:45,960 --> 03:56:48,469
it's different that's that's just like
if I record that how are we going to

9308
03:56:48,469 --> 03:56:48,479
if I record that how are we going to
 

9309
03:56:48,479 --> 03:56:52,349
if I record that how are we going to
like use that for like videos and stuff

9310
03:56:52,349 --> 03:56:52,359
like use that for like videos and stuff
 

9311
03:56:52,359 --> 03:56:54,149
like use that for like videos and stuff
where we want to put a background in and

9312
03:56:54,149 --> 03:56:54,159
where we want to put a background in and
 

9313
03:56:54,159 --> 03:56:56,630
where we want to put a background in and
change the Angles and so on no but what

9314
03:56:56,630 --> 03:56:56,640
change the Angles and so on no but what
 

9315
03:56:56,640 --> 03:57:00,189
change the Angles and so on no but what
we found is that it's possible to record

9316
03:57:00,189 --> 03:57:00,199
we found is that it's possible to record
 

9317
03:57:00,199 --> 03:57:02,830
we found is that it's possible to record
the motion data and then edit it

9318
03:57:02,830 --> 03:57:02,840
the motion data and then edit it
 

9319
03:57:02,840 --> 03:57:06,469
the motion data and then edit it
afterwards I put it on the video and put

9320
03:57:06,469 --> 03:57:06,479
afterwards I put it on the video and put
 

9321
03:57:06,479 --> 03:57:10,030
afterwards I put it on the video and put
the put it on a model and put it and

9322
03:57:10,030 --> 03:57:10,040
the put it on a model and put it and
 

9323
03:57:10,040 --> 03:57:14,429
the put it on a model and put it and
change the change some motion and fix it

9324
03:57:14,429 --> 03:57:14,439
change the change some motion and fix it
 

9325
03:57:14,439 --> 03:57:16,790
change the change some motion and fix it
fix it and change the Angles and

9326
03:57:16,790 --> 03:57:16,800
fix it and change the Angles and
 

9327
03:57:16,800 --> 03:57:19,389
fix it and change the Angles and
