1379
00:37:58,339 --> 00:38:00,880
agree with the cat.As for the boots, I recently received an email
from my manager.I just happened to say that there was a

1380
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:00,890
from my manager.I just happened to say that there was a
 

1381
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:02,999
from my manager.I just happened to say that there was a
day when I wasn't wearing a cap.What do you

1382
00:38:02,999 --> 00:38:03,009
day when I wasn't wearing a cap.What do you
 

1383
00:38:03,009 --> 00:38:05,090
day when I wasn't wearing a cap.What do you
think?  Oh, he

1384
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:05,100
think?  Oh, he
 

1385
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:08,180
think?  Oh, he
's my eldest son, so he wasn't wearing one again.

1386
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:08,190
's my eldest son, so he wasn't wearing one again.
 

1387
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:10,880
's my eldest son, so he wasn't wearing one again.
At that time, the manager asked me

1388
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:10,890
At that time, the manager asked me
 

1389
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:13,130
At that time, the manager asked me
if I wasn't wearing a cup cap today.

1390
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:16,730
if I wasn't wearing a cup cap today.

No, I don't always wear one.
 

1394
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:22,220
No, I don't always wear one.
Yes, there are days when I don't wear them, so I

1395
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:22,230
Yes, there are days when I don't wear them, so I
 

1396
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:24,260
Yes, there are days when I don't wear them, so I
didn't wear them today, but

1397
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:24,270
didn't wear them today, but
 

1398
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:26,620
didn't wear them today, but
she looked at me three times like, ``Are you okay?''

1399
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:26,630
she looked at me three times like, ``Are you okay?''

but your allies will tell you that you lost because you're weak.  It's
 

3227
01:26:46,130 --> 01:26:48,610
but your allies will tell you that you lost because you're weak.  It's
not because I'm weak, I would have bought it if I were strong,
