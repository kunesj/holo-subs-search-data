but just by doing all these hand

but just by doing all these hand
 

11369
05:41:34,958 --> 05:41:36,868
but just by doing all these hand
movements in this game maybe that's the

movements in this game maybe that's the
 

11371
05:41:36,878 --> 05:41:39,830
movements in this game maybe that's the
reason why it's a bit more tiring than

05:41:39,830 --> 05:41:39,840
reason why it's a bit more tiring than
 

11373
05:41:39,840 --> 05:41:42,990
reason why it's a bit more tiring than
