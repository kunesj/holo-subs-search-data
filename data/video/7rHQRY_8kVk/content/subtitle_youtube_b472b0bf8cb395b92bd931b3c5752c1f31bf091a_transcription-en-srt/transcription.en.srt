my home inside of it so anyway my SIM

1790
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:39,040

1791
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,789
my home inside of it so anyway my SIM
card Works in their phone but but that's

1792
00:53:41,789 --> 00:53:41,799
card Works in their phone but but that's
 

1793
00:53:41,799 --> 00:53:44,270
card Works in their phone but but that's
the that's the thing like when when they

1794
00:53:44,270 --> 00:53:44,280
the that's the thing like when when they
 

1795
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:46,589
the that's the thing like when when they
put my SIM card into their phone they're

1796
00:53:46,589 --> 00:53:46,599
put my SIM card into their phone they're
 

1797
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:48,230
put my SIM card into their phone they're
using my

1798
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:48,240
using my
 

1799
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,109
using my
provider

1800
00:53:50,109 --> 00:53:50,119
provider
 

1801
00:53:50,119 --> 00:53:54,309
provider
so what I figured after all that is it's

1802
00:53:54,309 --> 00:53:54,319
so what I figured after all that is it's
 

1803
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:57,190
so what I figured after all that is it's
my phone

1804
00:53:57,190 --> 00:53:57,200
my phone
 

1805
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,069
my phone
but but then but then how is that

1806
00:53:59,069 --> 00:53:59,079
but but then but then how is that
 

1807
00:53:59,079 --> 00:54:02,390
but but then but then how is that
logical because it's still my phone with

1808
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:02,400
logical because it's still my phone with
 

1809
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,349
logical because it's still my phone with
my SIM card works when I'm

6091
03:02:42,640 --> 03:02:45,830

6094
03:02:48,590 --> 03:02:48,600
without but it's made out of wood and I
 

6095
03:02:48,600 --> 03:02:51,269
without but it's made out of wood and I
noticed after I came back from my trip I

6096
03:02:51,269 --> 03:02:51,279
noticed after I came back from my trip I
 

6097
03:02:51,279 --> 03:02:52,750
noticed after I came back from my trip I
don't know it probably already started

6098
03:02:52,750 --> 03:02:52,760
don't know it probably already started
 

6099
03:02:52,760 --> 03:02:56,349
don't know it probably already started
molding before but yeah some parts of

6100
03:02:56,349 --> 03:02:56,359
molding before but yeah some parts of
 

6101
03:02:56,359 --> 03:03:02,269
molding before but yeah some parts of
the wood look kind of

6102
03:03:02,269 --> 03:03:02,279

 

6103
03:03:02,279 --> 03:03:05,550

moldy um I guess probably because I'm

6104
03:03:05,550 --> 03:03:05,560
moldy um I guess probably because I'm
 

6105
03:03:05,560 --> 03:03:07,269
moldy um I guess probably because I'm
not going to like Point any fingers this

6106
03:03:07,269 --> 03:03:07,279
not going to like Point any fingers this
 

6107
03:03:07,279 --> 03:03:08,950
not going to like Point any fingers this
could have been me this could have been

6108
03:03:08,950 --> 03:03:08,960
could have been me this could have been
 

6109
03:03:08,960 --> 03:03:12,550
could have been me this could have been
my um friends or mother who took care of

6110
03:03:12,550 --> 03:03:12,560
my um friends or mother who took care of
 

6111
03:03:12,560 --> 03:03:18,349
my um friends or mother who took care of
my cats but uh when showering in the

6112
03:03:18,349 --> 03:03:18,359
my cats but uh when showering in the
 

6113
03:03:18,359 --> 03:03:23,830
my cats but uh when showering in the
bathtub the tray was probably kept on

6114
03:03:23,830 --> 03:03:23,840
bathtub the tray was probably kept on
 

6115
03:03:23,840 --> 03:03:26,910
bathtub the tray was probably kept on
there on the bathtub while showering and

6116
03:03:26,910 --> 03:03:26,920
there on the bathtub while showering and
 

6117
03:03:26,920 --> 03:03:29,469
there on the bathtub while showering and
so a lot of shower water was probably

6118
03:03:29,469 --> 03:03:29,479
so a lot of shower water was probably
 

6119
03:03:29,479 --> 03:03:31,790
so a lot of shower water was probably
falling onto the

6120
03:03:31,790 --> 03:03:31,800
falling onto the
 

6121
03:03:31,800 --> 03:03:35,150
falling onto the
tray and so it was

6122
03:03:35,150 --> 03:03:35,160
tray and so it was
 

6123
03:03:35,160 --> 03:03:39,630
tray and so it was
probably unnecessarily wet a lot of the

6124
03:03:39,630 --> 03:03:39,640
probably unnecessarily wet a lot of the
 

6125
03:03:39,640 --> 03:03:41,830
probably unnecessarily wet a lot of the
time

6126
03:03:41,830 --> 03:03:41,840
time
 

6127
03:03:41,840 --> 03:03:45,110
time
yeah and then I noticed that some

6128
03:03:45,110 --> 03:03:45,120
yeah and then I noticed that some
 

6129
03:03:45,120 --> 03:03:48,910
yeah and then I noticed that some
sections of it became moldy and just

6130
03:03:48,910 --> 03:03:48,920
sections of it became moldy and just
 

6131
03:03:48,920 --> 03:03:50,150
sections of it became moldy and just
doesn't look nice anymore and then I

6132
03:03:50,150 --> 03:03:50,160
doesn't look nice anymore and then I
 

6133
03:03:50,160 --> 03:03:51,510
doesn't look nice anymore and then I
don't think you can fix that like you

6134
03:03:51,510 --> 03:03:51,520
don't think you can fix that like you
 

6135
03:03:51,520 --> 03:03:55,469
don't think you can fix that like you
can remove mold from from other surfaces

6136
03:03:55,469 --> 03:03:55,479
can remove mold from from other surfaces
 

6137
03:03:55,479 --> 03:03:58,150
can remove mold from from other surfaces
like tiles or

6138
03:03:58,150 --> 03:03:58,160
like tiles or
 

6139
03:03:58,160 --> 03:04:02,190
like tiles or
so but not from wood as far as I

6140
03:04:02,190 --> 03:04:02,200
so but not from wood as far as I
 

6141
03:04:02,200 --> 03:04:04,269
so but not from wood as far as I
know the tray shouldn't be able to get

6142
03:04:04,269 --> 03:04:04,279
know the tray shouldn't be able to get
 

6143
03:04:04,279 --> 03:04:06,030
know the tray shouldn't be able to get
moly in the first but it but it is wood

6144
03:04:06,030 --> 03:04:06,040
moly in the first but it but it is wood
 

6145
03:04:06,040 --> 03:04:07,790
moly in the first but it but it is wood
so it makes sense like I don't know how

6146
03:04:07,790 --> 03:04:07,800
so it makes sense like I don't know how
 

6147
03:04:07,800 --> 03:04:08,290
so it makes sense like I don't know how
you

6148
03:04:08,290 --> 03:04:08,300

6155
03:04:17,040 --> 03:04:18,229

wanted something that's safe so I got

6158
03:04:20,990 --> 03:04:21,000
wanted something that's safe so I got
 

6159
03:04:21,000 --> 03:04:23,710
wanted something that's safe so I got
one out of

6164
03:04:27,190 --> 03:04:27,200
but it looks like glass but I think it's
 

6165
03:04:27,200 --> 03:04:29,309
but it looks like glass but I think it's
probably plastic but it's like
