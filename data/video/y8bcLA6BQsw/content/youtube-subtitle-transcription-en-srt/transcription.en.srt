click it though maybe it's a b there's

5166
02:28:18,630 --> 02:28:18,640
click it though maybe it's a b there's
 

5167
02:28:18,640 --> 02:28:20,710
click it though maybe it's a b there's
no way that it's a limited been clicking

5168
02:28:20,710 --> 02:28:20,720
no way that it's a limited been clicking
 

5169
02:28:20,720 --> 02:28:24,670
no way that it's a limited been clicking
at the most yeah yeah it's probably B

5170
02:28:24,670 --> 02:28:24,680
at the most yeah yeah it's probably B
 

5171
02:28:24,680 --> 02:28:26,349
at the most yeah yeah it's probably B
but it's probably better than all four

5172
02:28:26,349 --> 02:28:26,359
but it's probably better than all four
 

5173
02:28:26,359 --> 02:28:27,910
but it's probably better than all four
of us doing it at the same time so that

5174
02:28:27,910 --> 02:28:27,920
of us doing it at the same time so that
 

5175
02:28:27,920 --> 02:28:30,110
of us doing it at the same time so that
is true yeah but the way to do it is

5176
02:28:30,110 --> 02:28:30,120
is true yeah but the way to do it is
 

5177
02:28:30,120 --> 02:28:32,670
is true yeah but the way to do it is
like you just keep track of like what

5178
02:28:32,670 --> 02:28:32,680
like you just keep track of like what
 

5179
02:28:32,680 --> 02:28:35,309
like you just keep track of like what
each like one block what it

5180
02:28:35,309 --> 02:28:35,319
each like one block what it
 

5181
02:28:35,319 --> 02:28:37,630
each like one block what it
fills but you just got to be mindful of

5182
02:28:37,630 --> 02:28:37,640
fills but you just got to be mindful of
 

5183
02:28:37,640 --> 02:28:39,150
fills but you just got to be mindful of
the ones that are on the side because

5184
02:28:39,150 --> 02:28:39,160
the ones that are on the side because
 

5185
02:28:39,160 --> 02:28:40,790
the ones that are on the side because
they'll affect the ones that are on a

5186
02:28:40,790 --> 02:28:40,800
they'll affect the ones that are on a
 

5187
