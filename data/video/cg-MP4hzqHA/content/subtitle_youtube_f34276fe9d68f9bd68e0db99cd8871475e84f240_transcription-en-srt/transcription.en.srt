what i'm gonna do is get an adult cat
that doesn't chew cords that's kind of

152
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:11,120
that doesn't chew cords that's kind of
 

153
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,309
that doesn't chew cords that's kind of

162
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:18,639
yeah yeah that's what i was thinking too
 

163
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,550
yeah yeah that's what i was thinking too
to get um an adult cat

164
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:20,560
to get um an adult cat
 

165
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,189
