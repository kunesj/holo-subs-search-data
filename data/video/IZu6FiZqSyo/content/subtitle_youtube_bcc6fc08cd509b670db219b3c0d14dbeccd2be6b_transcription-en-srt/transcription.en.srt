don't even know how to get started one
 

453
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,990
don't even know how to get started one
second let me move the microphone a

454
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,000
second let me move the microphone a
 

455
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,189
second let me move the microphone a
little bit over here and just

456
00:14:55,189 --> 00:14:55,199
little bit over here and just
 

457
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,189
little bit over here and just
just a little bit over here

458
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:57,199
just a little bit over here
 

459
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,590
just a little bit over here
and then you come a little bit closer

460
00:14:59,590 --> 00:14:59,600
and then you come a little bit closer
 

461
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,629
and then you come a little bit closer
buddy

462
00:15:00,629 --> 00:15:00,639
buddy
 

463
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:01,590
buddy
okay

464
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:01,600
okay
 

465
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,670
okay
so basically like for example here we're

466
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:03,680
so basically like for example here we're
 

467
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,990
so basically like for example here we're
gonna have kotori and then we turn it

468
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:06,000
gonna have kotori and then we turn it
 

469
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,470
gonna have kotori and then we turn it
around a little bit and here we're gonna

470
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:08,480
around a little bit and here we're gonna
 

471
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,910
around a little bit and here we're gonna
have like the

472
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:09,920
have like the
 

473
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,269
have like the
uh uh

474
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:11,279
uh uh
 

475
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,990
uh uh
shinigami sensei for example

476
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:14,000
shinigami sensei for example
 

477
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,710
shinigami sensei for example
and then here we can have like gouda's

478
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:16,720
and then here we can have like gouda's
 

479
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,430
and then here we can have like gouda's
symbol and so on you know what i mean

480
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:19,440
symbol and so on you know what i mean
 

481
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,710
symbol and so on you know what i mean
that's what i've been thinking about we

482
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:20,720
that's what i've been thinking about we
 

483
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,910
that's what i've been thinking about we
will see how long one one single

484
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:23,920
will see how long one one single
 

485
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,389
will see how long one one single
uh sign is gonna take me and i don't

through those hoops and she was fine she

4692
01:53:37,030 --> 01:53:37,040
through those hoops and she was fine she
 

4693
01:53:37,040 --> 01:53:40,790
through those hoops and she was fine she
was fine until the very last second when

4694
01:53:40,790 --> 01:53:40,800
was fine until the very last second when
 

4695
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:42,950
was fine until the very last second when
she was literally one

4696
01:53:42,950 --> 01:53:42,960
she was literally one
 

4697
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:44,310
she was literally one
millimeter

4698
01:53:44,310 --> 01:53:44,320
millimeter
 

4699
01:53:44,320 --> 01:53:46,550
millimeter
away from landing

4700
01:53:46,550 --> 01:53:46,560
away from landing
 

4701
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:49,990
away from landing
a meadow senpai shot her

4702
01:53:49,990 --> 01:53:50,000
a meadow senpai shot her
 

4703
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,870
a meadow senpai shot her
and she died in this in the same very

4704
01:53:52,870 --> 01:53:52,880
and she died in this in the same very
 

4705
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:57,030
and she died in this in the same very
moment when she was landing

4706
01:53:57,030 --> 01:53:57,040

 

4707
01:53:57,040 --> 01:53:59,109

so actually i'm wondering because it was

4708
01:53:59,109 --> 01:53:59,119
so actually i'm wondering because it was
 

4709
01:53:59,119 --> 01:54:01,350
so actually i'm wondering because it was
like five six people trying to shoot her

4710
01:54:01,350 --> 01:54:01,360
like five six people trying to shoot her
 

4711
01:54:01,360 --> 01:54:03,030
like five six people trying to shoot her
when she was flying

4712
01:54:03,030 --> 01:54:03,040
when she was flying
 

4713
01:54:03,040 --> 01:54:04,629
when she was flying
so i'm wondering

4714
01:54:04,629 --> 01:54:04,639
so i'm wondering
 

4715
01:54:04,639 --> 01:54:08,629
so i'm wondering
maybe it is actually pretty difficult

4716
01:54:08,629 --> 01:54:08,639
maybe it is actually pretty difficult
 

4717
01:54:08,639 --> 01:54:10,310
maybe it is actually pretty difficult
to land your hit

4718
01:54:10,310 --> 01:54:10,320
to land your hit
 

4719
01:54:10,320 --> 01:54:12,550
to land your hit
while that person is flying so you don't

4720
01:54:12,550 --> 01:54:12,560
while that person is flying so you don't
 

4721
01:54:12,560 --> 01:54:14,629
while that person is flying so you don't
have to worry too much about that part

4722
01:54:14,629 --> 01:54:14,639
have to worry too much about that part
 

4723
01:54:14,639 --> 01:54:16,709
have to worry too much about that part
but once you get closer to the ground

4724
01:54:16,709 --> 01:54:16,719
but once you get closer to the ground
 

4725
01:54:16,719 --> 01:54:19,189
but once you get closer to the ground
and you're about to land

4726
01:54:19,189 --> 01:54:19,199
and you're about to land
 

4727
01:54:19,199 --> 01:54:20,870
and you're about to land
that's when you're also like slowing

4728
01:54:20,870 --> 01:54:20,880
that's when you're also like slowing
 

4729
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:23,830
that's when you're also like slowing
down and they know where you're gonna

4730
01:54:23,830 --> 01:54:23,840
down and they know where you're gonna
 

4731
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:26,070
down and they know where you're gonna
fall down so

4732
01:54:26,070 --> 01:54:26,080
fall down so
 

4733
01:54:26,080 --> 01:54:28,790
fall down so
that is the moment where it gets really

4734
01:54:28,790 --> 01:54:28,800
that is the moment where it gets really
 

4735
01:54:28,800 --> 01:54:30,870
that is the moment where it gets really
clutch like how are you not gonna get

4736
01:54:30,870 --> 01:54:30,880
clutch like how are you not gonna get
 

4737
01:54:30,880 --> 01:54:32,629
clutch like how are you not gonna get
hit

4738
01:54:32,629 --> 01:54:32,639
hit
 

4739
01:54:32,639 --> 01:54:35,270
hit
at that very last moment

4740
01:54:35,270 --> 01:54:35,280
at that very last moment
 

4741
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:36,709
at that very last moment
right

4742
01:54:36,709 --> 01:54:36,719
right
 

4743
01:54:36,719 --> 01:54:38,390
right
or

4744
01:54:38,390 --> 01:54:38,400
or
 

4745
01:54:38,400 --> 01:54:41,060
or
since i would have full health

4746
01:54:41,060 --> 01:54:41,070

we are then gonna create glasses

4842
01:56:43,589 --> 01:56:43,599
we are then gonna create glasses
 

4843
01:56:43,599 --> 01:56:47,270
we are then gonna create glasses
and then

4844
01:56:47,270 --> 01:56:47,280

 

4845
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:51,669

the sunglasses we're gonna like put in

4846
01:56:51,669 --> 01:56:51,679
the sunglasses we're gonna like put in
 

4847
01:56:51,679 --> 01:56:54,229
the sunglasses we're gonna like put in
yeah with the toothpicks

4848
01:56:54,229 --> 01:56:54,239
yeah with the toothpicks
 

4849
01:56:54,239 --> 01:56:56,870
yeah with the toothpicks
or maybe even the whole face

4850
01:56:56,870 --> 01:56:56,880
or maybe even the whole face
 

4851
01:56:56,880 --> 01:56:58,550
or maybe even the whole face
or no i think i'll just do the glasses

4852
01:56:58,550 --> 01:56:58,560
or no i think i'll just do the glasses
 

4853
01:56:58,560 --> 01:56:59,910
or no i think i'll just do the glasses
it's easy

4854
01:56:59,910 --> 01:56:59,920
it's easy
 

4855
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:01,589
it's easy
because the glasses would be pretty

4856
01:57:01,589 --> 01:57:01,599
because the glasses would be pretty
 

4857
01:57:01,599 --> 01:57:03,030
