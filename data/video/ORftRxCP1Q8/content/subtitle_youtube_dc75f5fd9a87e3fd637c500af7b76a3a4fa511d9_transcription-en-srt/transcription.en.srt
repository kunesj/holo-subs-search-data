because we fought all poison strong

236
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:33,000

because we fought all poison strong
poison easy

238

240
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:37,440
and we failed but not really my fault I

just didn't get good cards
 

243
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:43,009
just didn't get good cards
that were harmonizing with each other I

244
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:43,019
that were harmonizing with each other I
 

245
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:46,030
that were harmonizing with each other I
suppose

246
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:46,040

 

247
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,790

ah for me the fact is the hardest yeah I

248
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:49,800
ah for me the fact is the hardest yeah I
 

249
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,610
ah for me the fact is the hardest yeah I
didn't get poison cards but then I guess

250
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:52,620
didn't get poison cards but then I guess
 

251
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,650
didn't get poison cards but then I guess
maybe I also made the mistake I'm not

252
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:54,660
maybe I also made the mistake I'm not
 

253

sure I don't remember but maybe I made

254
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:56,220
sure I don't remember but maybe I made
 

255
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,030
sure I don't remember but maybe I made
the mistake of like settling for a

9628
04:39:19,209 --> 04:39:19,219

 

9629
04:39:19,219 --> 04:39:22,010

very important
 

9631
04:39:22,020 --> 04:39:23,750
very important
but what I didn't expect for some reason

9632
04:39:23,750 --> 04:39:23,760
but what I didn't expect for some reason
 

9633
04:39:23,760 --> 04:39:26,029
but what I didn't expect for some reason
I thought it would be hotter over there

9634
04:39:26,029 --> 04:39:26,039
I thought it would be hotter over there
 

9635
04:39:26,039 --> 04:39:28,970
I thought it would be hotter over there
didn't expect it to be so cold in Boston

9636
04:39:28,970 --> 04:39:28,980
didn't expect it to be so cold in Boston
 

9637
04:39:28,980 --> 04:39:30,590
didn't expect it to be so cold in Boston
I thought you guys were just like not

9638
04:39:30,590 --> 04:39:30,600
I thought you guys were just like not
 

9639
04:39:30,600 --> 04:39:32,090
I thought you guys were just like not
able to communicate properly because

9640
04:39:32,090 --> 04:39:32,100
able to communicate properly because
 

9641
04:39:32,100 --> 04:39:34,131
able to communicate properly because
even though I said Celsius please you

9642
04:39:34,131 --> 04:39:34,141
even though I said Celsius please you
 

9643
04:39:34,141 --> 04:39:35,869
even though I said Celsius please you
guys were maybe saying in Fahrenheit or

9644
04:39:35,869 --> 04:39:35,879
guys were maybe saying in Fahrenheit or
 

9645
04:39:35,879 --> 04:39:36,590
guys were maybe saying in Fahrenheit or
so

9646
04:39:36,590 --> 04:39:36,600
so
 

9647
04:39:36,600 --> 04:39:38,208
so
and some people because I didn't hear it

9648
04:39:38,208 --> 04:39:38,218
and some people because I didn't hear it
 

9649
04:39:38,218 --> 04:39:40,070
and some people because I didn't hear it
so clearly some people were showing it

9650
04:39:40,070 --> 04:39:40,080
so clearly some people were showing it
 

9651
04:39:40,080 --> 04:39:43,130
so clearly some people were showing it
with their fingers and I'm like he's

9652
04:39:43,130 --> 04:39:43,140
with their fingers and I'm like he's
 

9653
04:39:43,140 --> 04:39:45,470
with their fingers and I'm like he's
showing nine fingers what does he mean

9654
04:39:45,470 --> 04:39:45,480
showing nine fingers what does he mean
 

9655
04:39:45,480 --> 04:39:47,390
showing nine fingers what does he mean
there's no way it's just what does he

9656
04:39:47,390 --> 04:39:47,400
there's no way it's just what does he
 

9657
04:39:47,400 --> 04:39:50,930
there's no way it's just what does he
mean 54 because one hand is five and one

9658
04:39:50,930 --> 04:39:50,940
mean 54 because one hand is five and one
 

9659
04:39:50,940 --> 04:39:54,770
mean 54 because one hand is five and one
is four 54 Fahrenheit Maybe

9660
04:39:54,770 --> 04:39:54,780
is four 54 Fahrenheit Maybe
 

9661
04:39:54,780 --> 04:39:57,948
is four 54 Fahrenheit Maybe
which is I guess kind of realistic right

9662
04:39:57,948 --> 04:39:57,958
which is I guess kind of realistic right
 

9663
04:39:57,958 --> 04:40:00,708
which is I guess kind of realistic right

probably never that cold in Indonesia is
 

9679
04:40:19,620 --> 04:40:22,670
probably never that cold in Indonesia is
it

9680

makes sense

9690
04:40:49,910 --> 04:40:49,920

04:51:24,948 --> 04:51:24,958
the if we could have tested that
 

10173
04:51:24,958 --> 04:51:26,270
the if we could have tested that
out properly if there would have been

10174
04:51:26,270 --> 04:51:26,280
out properly if there would have been
 

10175
04:51:26,280 --> 04:51:28,430
out properly if there would have been
time I would have added like a million

04:51:28,430 --> 04:51:28,440
time I would have added like a million
 

10177
04:51:28,440 --> 04:51:31,510
time I would have added like a million
more eggs

10178
04:51:31,510 --> 04:51:31,520

 

10179
04:51:31,520 --> 04:51:35,330

or another area

10180
04:51:35,330 --> 04:51:35,340
or another area
 

10181
04:51:35,340 --> 04:51:39,590
or another area

we had no chance
 

10187
04:51:44,760 --> 04:51:47,330
we had no chance
and she especially got all these

10188
04:51:47,330 --> 04:51:47,340
and she especially got all these
 

10189
04:51:47,340 --> 04:51:49,390
and she especially got all these
Chihuahua eggs that give five points

10190
04:51:49,390 --> 04:51:49,400
Chihuahua eggs that give five points
 

10191
04:51:49,400 --> 04:51:56,330
Chihuahua eggs that give five points

10195
04:51:58,680 --> 04:52:00,410

more in the in the private rooms because

10196
04:52:00,410 --> 04:52:00,420
more in the in the private rooms because
 

10197
04:52:00,420 --> 04:52:01,970
more in the in the private rooms because
I think the private rooms legit didn't

10198
04:52:01,970 --> 04:52:01,980
I think the private rooms legit didn't
 

10199
04:52:01,980 --> 04:52:06,788
I think the private rooms legit didn't
have so many eggs

10200
04:52:06,788 --> 04:52:06,798

 

10201

and I wanted I wanted to play in desktop

10330
04:54:38,270 --> 04:54:38,280
and I wanted I wanted to play in desktop
 

10331
04:54:38,280 --> 04:54:40,430
and I wanted I wanted to play in desktop
mode because it takes quite a bit of

10332
04:54:40,430 --> 04:54:40,440
mode because it takes quite a bit of
 

10333
04:54:40,440 --> 04:54:41,930
mode because it takes quite a bit of
stress off of me

10348
04:54:58,070 --> 04:54:58,080
desktop it would render the camera
 

10349
04:54:58,080 --> 04:55:00,830
desktop it would render the camera
system to the desktop view the window on

10350
04:55:00,830 --> 04:55:00,840
system to the desktop view the window on
 

10351

the desktop
 

10353
04:55:01,798 --> 04:55:04,730
the desktop
so you can capture it with obs

10354
04:55:04,730 --> 04:55:04,740
so you can capture it with obs
 

10355
04:55:04,740 --> 04:55:06,470
so you can capture it with obs
um if I don't know if you understand

10356
04:55:06,470 --> 04:55:06,480

10360
04:55:09,770 --> 04:55:09,780
but basically if I were to play on

04:56:03,360 --> 04:56:05,150
that's why another reason why we started
a little bit late because she had to

10404
04:56:05,150 --> 04:56:05,160
a little bit late because she had to
 

10405

one wasn't so hard to catch I think how

11288
05:17:24,288 --> 05:17:24,298
one wasn't so hard to catch I think how
 

11289
05:17:24,298 --> 05:17:25,850
one wasn't so hard to catch I think how
did I do it did I just pick it up

05:17:25,850 --> 05:17:25,860
did I do it did I just pick it up
 

11291
05:17:25,860 --> 05:17:27,110
did I do it did I just pick it up
normally

normally
 

11293
05:17:27,120 --> 05:17:30,350
normally
 so easy see that means this should

11294
05:17:30,350 --> 05:17:30,360
so easy see that means this should
 

11295
05:17:30,360 --> 05:17:32,330

be extremely easy to just steal it as
