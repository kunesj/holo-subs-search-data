then you should be able to invest a lot
 

3433
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:12,870
then you should be able to invest a lot
of time into it

of time into it
 

3435
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:14,229
of time into it
because if you don't then you won't be

3436
01:37:14,229 --> 01:37:14,239
because if you don't then you won't be
 

3437
01:37:14,239 --> 01:37:15,990

of your time into it
 

3445
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:24,790
of your time into it
and you have to take the risk that if

3446
01:37:24,790 --> 01:37:24,800
and you have to take the risk that if
 

3447
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:27,030
and you have to take the risk that if
especially if you're independent

3448
01:37:27,030 --> 01:37:27,040
especially if you're independent
 

3449
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:29,430
especially if you're independent
even if you put all of your energy and

3450
01:37:29,430 --> 01:37:29,440
even if you put all of your energy and
 

3451
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:31,830
even if you put all of your energy and
time into it you might not be successful

3452
01:37:31,830 --> 01:37:31,840
time into it you might not be successful
 

3453
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:33,990
time into it you might not be successful
because right now it's kind of booming

3454
01:37:33,990 --> 01:37:34,000
because right now it's kind of booming
 

3455
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:35,030

and everyone is
 

3457
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:37,350
and everyone is
uh everyone wants to be a beacher right

3458
01:37:37,350 --> 01:37:37,360
uh everyone wants to be a beacher right
 

3459
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:39,350
uh everyone wants to be a beacher right
now there's so many independents out

3460
01:37:39,350 --> 01:37:39,360
now there's so many independents out
 

3461
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:40,310
now there's so many independents out
there right now

3462

there right now
 

3463
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:43,350
there right now
so you have to figure out a good balance

3464
01:37:43,350 --> 01:37:43,360
so you have to figure out a good balance
 

3465
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:43,669
so you have to figure out a good balance
of

3466
01:37:43,669 --> 01:37:43,679
of
 

3467
01:37:43,679 --> 01:37:47,669
of
having a base um a safe base

3468
01:37:47,669 --> 01:37:47,679
having a base um a safe base
 

3469
01:37:47,679 --> 01:37:50,950
having a base um a safe base
something you can fall back onto like a

3470
01:37:50,950 --> 01:37:50,960
something you can fall back onto like a
 

3471
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:52,790
something you can fall back onto like a
different job or something

3472
01:37:52,790 --> 01:37:52,800
different job or something
 

3473
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:54,390
different job or something
but still have enough time to actually

3474
01:37:54,390 --> 01:37:54,400
but still have enough time to actually
 

3475
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:55,910
but still have enough time to actually
get this thing started because if you

3476
01:37:55,910 --> 01:37:55,920
get this thing started because if you
 

3477
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:57,030
get this thing started because if you
don't

3478
01:37:57,030 --> 01:37:57,040
don't
 

3479
01:37:57,040 --> 01:38:00,070
don't
like hype up your w and then actually

3480
01:38:00,070 --> 01:38:00,080
like hype up your w and then actually
 

3481
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:00,870
like hype up your w and then actually
like put out

3482
01:38:00,870 --> 01:38:00,880
like put out
 

3483
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:03,430
like put out
constant content in the beginning from

3484
01:38:03,430 --> 01:38:03,440
constant content in the beginning from
 

3485
01:38:03,440 --> 01:38:05,910
constant content in the beginning from

3486
01:38:05,910 --> 01:38:05,920

3487
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:07,750
the beginning continuously
and people will not pay attention to you

3488
01:38:07,750 --> 01:38:07,760
and people will not pay attention to you
 

3489
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:10,070
and people will not pay attention to you
and quickly move on to someone else i

3490
01:38:10,070 --> 01:38:10,080
and quickly move on to someone else i
 

3491
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:13,430

3493
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:15,990

so the best is especially even if you're

3517
01:38:34,239 --> 01:38:36,070
the debut
time is very important because many
