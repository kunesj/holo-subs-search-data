panel uh but I have an accent suit and I

2178
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:49,920
panel uh but I have an accent suit and I
 

2179
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,269
panel uh but I have an accent suit and I
am more and more figuring out how to use

2180
01:03:52,269 --> 01:03:52,279
am more and more figuring out how to use
 

2181
01:03:52,279 --> 01:03:55,269
am more and more figuring out how to use
it and when I heard I'm being invited to

2182
01:03:55,269 --> 01:03:55,279
it and when I heard I'm being invited to
 

2183
01:03:55,279 --> 01:03:59,150
it and when I heard I'm being invited to
off and it's like quite a while to go I

2184
01:03:59,150 --> 01:03:59,160
off and it's like quite a while to go I
 

2185
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:00,910
off and it's like quite a while to go I
thought okay that's enough time for me

2186
01:04:00,910 --> 01:04:00,920
thought okay that's enough time for me
 

2187
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,190
thought okay that's enough time for me
to

2188
01:04:02,190 --> 01:04:02,200
to
 

2189
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:06,230
to
prepare my suit in a way that I can do a

2190
01:04:06,230 --> 01:04:06,240
prepare my suit in a way that I can do a
 

2191
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:10,349
prepare my suit in a way that I can do a
3D appearance at the panel now

2192
01:04:10,349 --> 01:04:10,359
3D appearance at the panel now
 

2193
01:04:10,359 --> 01:04:15,630
3D appearance at the panel now
don't don't even dare to expect

2194
01:04:15,630 --> 01:04:15,640
don't don't even dare to expect
 

2195
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:19,029
don't don't even dare to expect
something as dope as what they prepare

2196
01:04:19,029 --> 01:04:19,039
something as dope as what they prepare
 

2197
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:22,109
something as dope as what they prepare
when when whole life is actually behind

2198
01:04:22,109 --> 01:04:22,119
when when whole life is actually behind
 

2199
01:04:22,119 --> 01:04:24,589
when when whole life is actually behind
it and supporting the whole thing and

2200
01:04:24,589 --> 01:04:24,599
it and supporting the whole thing and
 

2201
01:04:24,599 --> 01:04:27,069
it and supporting the whole thing and
giving them proper motion tracking and

2202
01:04:27,069 --> 01:04:27,079
giving them proper motion tracking and
 

2203
01:04:27,079 --> 01:04:31,109
giving them proper motion tracking and
whatever don't dare and also there will

2204
01:04:31,109 --> 01:04:31,119
whatever don't dare and also there will
 

2205
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:34,109
whatever don't dare and also there will
probably be not even a special

2206
01:04:34,109 --> 01:04:34,119
probably be not even a special
 

2207
01:04:34,119 --> 01:04:35,670
probably be not even a special
background maybe I'll just do it on a

2208
01:04:35,670 --> 01:04:35,680
background maybe I'll just do it on a
 

2209
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:37,029
background maybe I'll just do it on a
white

2210
01:04:37,029 --> 01:04:37,039
white
 

2211
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:39,710
white
background and probably not even camera

2212
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:39,720
background and probably not even camera
 

2213
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:41,870
background and probably not even camera
angles but I still

2214
01:04:41,870 --> 01:04:41,880
angles but I still
 

2215
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:46,309
angles but I still
thought and I should give it a try

2216
01:04:46,309 --> 01:04:46,319
thought and I should give it a try
 

2217
01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:48,950
thought and I should give it a try
to I'm going to sing my songs obviously

2218
01:04:48,950 --> 01:04:48,960
to I'm going to sing my songs obviously
 

2219
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:53,109
to I'm going to sing my songs obviously
so I might as well try to do it in

2220
01:04:53,109 --> 01:04:53,119

 

2221
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:56,309

01:04:58,029 --> 01:04:58,039
I'm just trying
 

2225
01:04:58,039 --> 01:05:02,269
I'm just trying
to make the panel uh a little bit better

2226
01:05:02,269 --> 01:05:02,279
to make the panel uh a little bit better
 

2227
01:05:02,279 --> 01:05:04,470
to make the panel uh a little bit better
with the means that I have with what I

2228
01:05:04,470 --> 01:05:04,480
with the means that I have with what I
 

2229
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:06,789
with the means that I have with what I
can do but it's you know I'm doing it on

2230
01:05:06,789 --> 01:05:06,799
can do but it's you know I'm doing it on
 

2231
01:05:06,799 --> 01:05:08,670
can do but it's you know I'm doing it on
my own I'm doing it it's my own choice

2233
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:14,190
my own I'm doing it it's my own choice
to make it 3D if I if I do and um it's

2234
01:05:14,190 --> 01:05:14,200
to make it 3D if I if I do and um it's
 

2235
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:16,510
to make it 3D if I if I do and um it's
with my own equipment and my own

2236
01:05:16,510 --> 01:05:16,520
with my own equipment and my own
 

2237

okay then maybe you guys can see what I
 

2285
01:06:28,279 --> 01:06:30,069
okay then maybe you guys can see what I
I'll be doing and see my scuff and

I'll be doing and see my scuff and
 

2287
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:34,150
I'll be doing and see my scuff and
probably my tech issues and

2294
01:06:42,029 --> 01:06:42,039
am I main
 

2295
01:06:42,039 --> 01:06:47,789
am I main
stage am I I have to ask I would hope

2296
01:06:47,789 --> 01:06:47,799
stage am I I have to ask I would hope
 

2297
01:06:47,799 --> 01:06:52,029
stage am I I have to ask I would hope
so yeah I already told jenma like oh

2298
01:06:52,029 --> 01:06:52,039
so yeah I already told jenma like oh
 

2299
01:06:52,039 --> 01:06:54,029
so yeah I already told jenma like oh
okay maybe I'm going to do it in

2300
01:06:54,029 --> 01:06:54,039
okay maybe I'm going to do it in
 

2301
01:06:54,039 --> 01:06:56,990
okay maybe I'm going to do it in
freie so

2302
01:06:56,990 --> 01:06:57,000
freie so
 

2303
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,549
freie so
I hope I can do something

2304
01:06:59,549 --> 01:06:59,559
I hope I can do something
 

2305
01:06:59,559 --> 01:07:02,390
I hope I can do something
cool I'm I'm a bit nervous about it but

2306
01:07:02,390 --> 01:07:02,400
cool I'm I'm a bit nervous about it but
 

2307
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,470
cool I'm I'm a bit nervous about it but
I mean we'll we'll probably with the

2308
01:07:04,470 --> 01:07:04,480
I mean we'll we'll probably with the
 

2309
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:07,190
I mean we'll we'll probably with the
memb stream we'll already figure out

2310
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:07,200
memb stream we'll already figure out
 

2311
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:15,109
memb stream we'll already figure out
like what's in the realm of possibility

2312
01:07:15,109 --> 01:07:15,119

 

2313
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:17,349

roughly because if it's something

2314
01:07:17,349 --> 01:07:17,359
roughly because if it's something
 

2315
01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:18,829
roughly because if it's something
pre-recorded if the motion is

2316
01:07:18,829 --> 01:07:18,839
pre-recorded if the motion is
 

2317
01:07:18,839 --> 01:07:21,710
pre-recorded if the motion is
pre-recorded then I can still somewhat

2318
01:07:21,710 --> 01:07:21,720
pre-recorded then I can still somewhat
 

2319
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:23,990
pre-recorded then I can still somewhat
have it be cleaned up you know for the

2320
01:07:23,990 --> 01:07:24,000
have it be cleaned up you know for the
 

2321
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,870
have it be cleaned up you know for the
MV for example for era that motion is

2322
01:07:27,870 --> 01:07:27,880
MV for example for era that motion is
 

2323
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:30,750
MV for example for era that motion is
not is not completely Raw it's um

2324
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:30,760
not is not completely Raw it's um
 

2325
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:32,829
not is not completely Raw it's um
cleaned up a little bit here and there

2326
01:07:32,829 --> 01:07:32,839
cleaned up a little bit here and there
 

2327
01:07:32,839 --> 01:07:34,150
cleaned up a little bit here and there
and then it looks a little bit better I

2328
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:34,160
and then it looks a little bit better I
 

2329
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:36,109
and then it looks a little bit better I
don't know what kind of U does to clean

2330
01:07:36,109 --> 01:07:36,119
don't know what kind of U does to clean
 

2331
01:07:36,119 --> 01:07:39,470
don't know what kind of U does to clean
it up but that means when it's live it's

2332
01:07:39,470 --> 01:07:39,480
it up but that means when it's live it's
 

2333
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:40,870
it up but that means when it's live it's
not going to
