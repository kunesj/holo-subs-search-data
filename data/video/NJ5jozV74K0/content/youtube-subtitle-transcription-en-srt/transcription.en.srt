walk walked I'm maybe build push me down

2940
01:26:52,070 --> 01:26:52,080
walk walked I'm maybe build push me down
 

2941
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:55,790
walk walked I'm maybe build push me down
sry um no no no no like we found the

2942
01:26:55,790 --> 01:26:55,800
sry um no no no no like we found the
 

2943
01:26:55,800 --> 01:27:02,149
sry um no no no no like we found the
pipeline because of that

2944
01:27:02,149 --> 01:27:02,159

 

2945
01:27:02,159 --> 01:27:05,709

so oh you can over here this goes here

01:27:22,679 --> 01:27:26,669
went I'm trying we're trying to get
back I'm not looking in the map so oh oh

2960
01:27:26,669 --> 01:27:26,679
back I'm not looking in the map so oh oh
 

2961
01:27:26,679 --> 01:27:29,070
back I'm not looking in the map so oh oh
you're going the opposite way you're

2962
01:27:29,070 --> 01:27:29,080
you're going the opposite way you're
 

2963
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:30,790
you're going the opposite way you're
going the opposite

2979
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:57,109

we got to get back up there I

2980
01:27:57,109 --> 01:27:57,119
we got to get back up there I
 

2981
01:27:57,119 --> 01:28:01,990
we got to get back up there I
think it sticks on them nice okay go

2982
01:28:01,990 --> 01:28:02,000
think it sticks on them nice okay go
 

2983

01:28:03,149 --> 01:28:03,159
down
 

2985
01:28:03,159 --> 01:28:06,790
down
there pipelines in place

2986
01:28:06,790 --> 01:28:06,800
there pipelines in place
 

2987
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:11,790
there pipelines in place
not got to go up there that

2988
01:28:11,790 --> 01:28:11,800

 

2989
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:13,310

we where go over there um here yeah we
got to go that way okay I can just have

2994
01:28:21,310 --> 01:28:21,320
got to go that way okay I can just have
 

2995
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:25,830
got to go that way okay I can just have
a traversal tool

2996
01:28:25,830 --> 01:28:25,840

 

2997
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:30,510
