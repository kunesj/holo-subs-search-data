3467
01:26:49,620 --> 01:26:52,070
well I'll try to figure out if I can do
that in the future and maybe it will try

3468
01:26:52,070 --> 01:26:52,080
that in the future and maybe it will try
 

3469
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:54,350
that in the future and maybe it will try
to mount a camera around my ceiling or

3470
01:26:54,350 --> 01:26:54,360
