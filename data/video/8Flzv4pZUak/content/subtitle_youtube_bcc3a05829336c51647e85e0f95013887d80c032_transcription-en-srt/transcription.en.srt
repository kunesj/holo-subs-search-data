i was thinking
 

15045
06:55:01,760 --> 06:55:03,830
i was thinking
there's a small chance i was thinking of

15054
06:55:12,230 --> 06:55:12,240
uh like afterwards like at the same time
 

15055
06:55:12,240 --> 06:55:14,868
uh like afterwards like at the same time
but instead on friday

15056
06:55:14,868 --> 06:55:14,878
but instead on friday
 

15057
06:55:14,878 --> 06:55:15,990
but instead on friday
because

15058
06:55:15,990 --> 06:55:16,000
because
 

15059
06:55:16,000 --> 06:55:17,910
because
then i can

15060
06:55:17,910 --> 06:55:17,920
