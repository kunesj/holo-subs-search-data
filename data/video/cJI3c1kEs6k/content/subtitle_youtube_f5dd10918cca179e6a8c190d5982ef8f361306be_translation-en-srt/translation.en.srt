look into it, it feels like you'll probably wake up in the evening.So
seriously, I slept like that every day.

291

sleep when I can,
 

300
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,790
sleep when I can,
and I haven't eaten, and that's exactly why I

Sleep is more important than anything else, that's why.

true that it looks a little different, but things like character maids and caramel whipped strawberries. Sakamoto eats so slowly that it looks like a fountain, and I think it's stuffed with ice cream that you can't buy. It gets sticky. You'll definitely need a bath.  I think that kind of problem will come up.Well, there are

When you move, you

When you move, you
throw them away and buy new ones, but it's

throw them away and buy new ones, but it's

00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:32,450

not like you're throwing everything away. It's like you're

754
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:32,460
not like you're throwing everything away. It's like you're
 

755
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:35,750
not like you're throwing everything away. It's like you're
basically decluttering, keeping only your favorite things.

756
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:35,760
basically decluttering, keeping only your favorite things.

a waste, and I
didn't want to buy them because they were so expensive, but

didn't want to buy them because they were so expensive, but
 

774
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:04,930
didn't want to buy them because they were so expensive, but
when I got more favorites, I was wondering what to do with them, so I

775
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:04,940
when I got more favorites, I was wondering what to do with them, so I
 

776
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,909
when I got more favorites, I was wondering what to do with them, so I
decided to make them a little cheaper, and

777
00:24:07,909 --> 00:24:07,919
decided to make them a little cheaper, and
 

778
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:13,990
decided to make them a little cheaper, and
now they're just cheap, cute clothes.

838
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,890

That's a difficult question.As I've

839
00:25:59,890 --> 00:25:59,900
That's a difficult question.As I've
 

840
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,950
That's a difficult question.As I've
been to many different countries, I've

841
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:02,960
been to many different countries, I've
 

842
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,310
been to many different countries, I've
noticed that the

843
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:06,320
noticed that the
 

844
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,830
noticed that the
love for animals seems to be the same no matter where you go.  Most of the

845
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:13,130
love for animals seems to be the same no matter where you go.  Most of the
 

846
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:14,529

 

847
00:26:14,529 --> 00:26:14,539

 

848
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:18,230

things inside are like that,

849
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:18,240
things inside are like that,
 

850
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,210
things inside are like that,
but the design inside the building is quite

851
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:23,220
but the design inside the building is quite
 

852
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,130
but the design inside the building is quite
different, and it's quite structured, and it's

853
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:25,140
different, and it's quite structured, and it's
 

854
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,370
different, and it's quite structured, and it's
frozen.I think it's

855
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:27,380
frozen.I think it's
 

856
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:31,250
frozen.I think it's
interesting, but if I had to choose, I feel

857
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:35,710
interesting, but if I had to choose, I feel
 

858
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:35,720

 

859
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:40,010

bad for the creatures in the aquarium.  The

860
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:40,020
bad for the creatures in the aquarium.  The
 

861
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:45,230
bad for the creatures in the aquarium.  The
fish have quite a bit of space and

862
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:45,240
fish have quite a bit of space and
 

863
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,350
fish have quite a bit of space and
seem to be living happily together, so I guess

864
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:47,360
seem to be living happily together, so I guess
 

865
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,190
seem to be living happily together, so I guess
that's okay.

866
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:51,200
that's okay.
 

867
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:58,090

. I actually posted a summary

990
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:29,100
. I actually posted a summary
 

991
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,909
. I actually posted a summary
for the community to see the overall effect. I was

992
00:30:31,909 --> 00:30:31,919
for the community to see the overall effect. I was
 

993
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,269
for the community to see the overall effect. I was
wondering what Nena was doing as a human. She's been doing

994
00:30:34,269 --> 00:30:34,279
wondering what Nena was doing as a human. She's been doing
 

995
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:38,510
wondering what Nena was doing as a human. She's been doing
quite a lot of things and is probably starting to do so now.  Even if you enter  I don't know

996
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:38,520
quite a lot of things and is probably starting to do so now.  Even if you enter  I don't know
 

997
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,269
quite a lot of things and is probably starting to do so now.  Even if you enter  I don't know
how long ago it was, but if it's wallpaper from about 2 months ago, I

998
00:30:41,269 --> 00:30:41,279
how long ago it was, but if it's wallpaper from about 2 months ago, I
 

999
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:44,750
how long ago it was, but if it's wallpaper from about 2 months ago, I
can collect it, so please

1000
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:44,760
can collect it, so please
 

1001
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,710
can collect it, so please

I'm really

1004
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:51,059
I'm really
 

1005
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:54,409
I'm really
happy to use it. It's a bit strange,

1006
00:30:54,409 --> 00:30:54,419
happy to use it. It's a bit strange,
 

1007
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:58,430
happy to use it. It's a bit strange,
but it might be a little

1008
00:30:58,430 --> 00:30:58,440
but it might be a little
 

1009
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,409
but it might be a little
surprising.  I don't, but I'm kind of shy. I'm scared

1010
00:31:00,409 --> 00:31:01,510
surprising.  I don't, but I'm kind of shy. I'm scared
 

1011
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:01,520

 

1012
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:05,930

to talk to that person,

1013
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:05,940
to talk to that person,
 

1014
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:09,590
to talk to that person,
but I feel sorry for them because they take up so much of my time, so I

1015
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:12,889
but I feel sorry for them because they take up so much of my time, so I
 

1016
00:31:12,889 --> 00:31:12,899

 

1017
00:31:12,899 --> 00:31:15,830

have a hard time talking to them, and I can't invite them to collaborate with me at all.

1018
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:15,840
have a hard time talking to them, and I can't invite them to collaborate with me at all.
 

1019
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,590
have a hard time talking to them, and I can't invite them to collaborate with me at all.
Lately,

1020
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:18,600
Lately,
 

1021
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,950
Lately,
you've been inviting me to collaborate with you in such a serious way, shaking my heart. So

1022
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,510
you've been inviting me to collaborate with you in such a serious way, shaking my heart. So
 

1023
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:23,520

 

1024
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,789

every time I write, I write and

1025
00:31:25,789 --> 00:31:25,799
every time I write, I write and
 

1026
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:27,769
every time I write, I write and
erase, and it becomes super long, and I write and divide it into sections. I

1027
00:31:27,769 --> 00:31:27,779
erase, and it becomes super long, and I write and divide it into sections. I
 

1028
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:29,750
erase, and it becomes super long, and I write and divide it into sections. I
don't need long texts like this.  I deleted everything once and said "Hey,"

1029
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:32,029
don't need long texts like this.  I deleted everything once and said "Hey,"
 

1030
00:31:32,029 --> 00:31:32,039

 

1031
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:35,510

and in the end I was invited to do a collaboration,

1032
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:37,250
and in the end I was invited to do a collaboration,
 

1033
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:37,260

 

1034
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:40,850

but I've always wanted to get over that, so I've been

1035
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:40,860
but I've always wanted to get over that, so I've been
 

1036
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:44,149
but I've always wanted to get over that, so I've been
thinking about collaborating with Sakamoto for a while.  I do

1037
00:31:44,149 --> 00:31:46,490
thinking about collaborating with Sakamoto for a while.  I do
 

1038
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:46,500

 

1039
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,409

n't know if it's because I say some cheeky things or not, but seriously, I was really

1040
00:31:48,409 --> 00:31:48,419
n't know if it's because I say some cheeky things or not, but seriously, I was really
 

1041
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:51,350
n't know if it's because I say some cheeky things or not, but seriously, I was really
nervous one more time, like in Kamakura the other day,

1042
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:51,360
nervous one more time, like in Kamakura the other day,
 

1043
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,289
nervous one more time, like in Kamakura the other day,
and I was really nervous, so I was so

1044
00:31:54,289 --> 00:31:54,299
and I was really nervous, so I was so
 

1045
00:31:54,299 --> 00:31:56,690
and I was really nervous, so I was so
nervous that I had to single-task.  I do

1046
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:59,330
nervous that I had to single-task.  I do
 

1047
00:31:59,330 --> 00:31:59,340

 

1048
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,850

n't know what to say anymore, my hair is so long that I don't know

1049
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:01,860
n't know what to say anymore, my hair is so long that I don't know
 

1050
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:05,510
n't know what to say anymore, my hair is so long that I don't know
what to say anymore, but that's about it. He's

1051
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:05,520
what to say anymore, but that's about it. He's
 

1052
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,570
what to say anymore, but that's about it. He's
incredibly kind, and

1053
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:08,580
incredibly kind, and
 

1054
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:11,450
incredibly kind, and
when I talk to him, he responds right away.

1055
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:14,870
when I talk to him, he responds right away.
 

1056
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:14,880

 

1057
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,649


1058
00:32:18,649 --> 00:32:18,659

 

1059
00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:22,310

Even though I'm such a normal person, I get really nervous and I'm surprised. I feel like I can

1060
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:22,320
Even though I'm such a normal person, I get really nervous and I'm surprised. I feel like I can
 

1061
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,269
Even though I'm such a normal person, I get really nervous and I'm surprised. I feel like I can
somehow overcome this problem by taking advantage of this opportunity.It

1062
00:32:26,269 --> 00:32:28,690
somehow overcome this problem by taking advantage of this opportunity.It
 

1063
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:31,810

 

1064
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:31,820

 

1065
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:35,990

took me more than a year to take action, but it's

1066
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:36,000
took me more than a year to take action, but it's
 

1067
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,210
took me more than a year to take action, but it's
taken me over the past year.  I

1068
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:38,220
taken me over the past year.  I
 

1069
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:41,350
taken me over the past year.  I
want you to take a look around me.

1070
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:45,250

 

1071
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:45,260

 

1072
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:48,649

So, if I were to say that there are people I could easily invite right now, I wouldn't invite my classmates,

1073
00:32:48,649 --> 00:32:48,659
So, if I were to say that there are people I could easily invite right now, I wouldn't invite my classmates,
 

1074
00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:51,889
So, if I were to say that there are people I could easily invite right now, I wouldn't invite my classmates,
but I wouldn't invite my classmates either. My classmates are my syncmates, so I

1075
00:32:51,889 --> 00:32:51,899
but I wouldn't invite my classmates either. My classmates are my syncmates, so I
 

1076
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:54,529
but I wouldn't invite my classmates either. My classmates are my syncmates, so I
have some idea of ​​their schedules, etc.

1077
00:32:54,529 --> 00:32:54,539
have some idea of ​​their schedules, etc.
 

1078
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:57,590
have some idea of ​​their schedules, etc.
None makes me

1079
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:57,600
None makes me
 

1080
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,590
None makes me
think you're busy. You

1081
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:00,600
think you're busy. You
 

1082
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,190
think you're busy. You
look like you're busy. Just look at it normally.

1083
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:06,350
look like you're busy. Just look at it normally.
 

1084
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:06,360

 

1085
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,690

If there's this here and this and this and that, then I'd probably want to stream it on this

1086
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:08,700
If there's this here and this and this and that, then I'd probably want to stream it on this
 

1087
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:11,630
If there's this here and this and this and that, then I'd probably want to stream it on this
day. If there's nothing, I'll probably take some time off.  I

1088
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:15,049
day. If there's nothing, I'll probably take some time off.  I
 

1089
00:33:15,049 --> 00:33:15,059

 

1090
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:16,970

can't invite her because I'm thinking about things like that, but I guess it's

1091
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:19,250
can't invite her because I'm thinking about things like that, but I guess it's
 

1092
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:19,260

 

1093
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:22,130

easier to invite her at a time when we've been together for a while, like the other day,

1094
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:22,140
easier to invite her at a time when we've been together for a while, like the other day,
 

1095
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,649
easier to invite her at a time when we've been together for a while, like the other day,
Nenan, Gartic Phone, etc.

1096
00:33:24,649 --> 00:33:24,659
Nenan, Gartic Phone, etc.
 

1097
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:28,070
Nenan, Gartic Phone, etc.
After that, we all went together for a while.  I

1098
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:30,409
After that, we all went together for a while.  I
 

1099
00:33:30,409 --> 00:33:30,419

 

1100
00:33:30,419 --> 00:33:32,810

want to do a lot of things at that timing, like the scene where we're talking on the phone.We talked a little about

1101
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:32,820
want to do a lot of things at that timing, like the scene where we're talking on the phone.We talked a little about
 

1102
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,450
want to do a lot of things at that timing, like the scene where we're talking on the phone.We talked a little about
doing something like this, but we

1103
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:34,460
doing something like this, but we
 

1104
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:37,789
doing something like this, but we
can't talk unless it's at a timing like that.It's like "

1105
00:33:37,789 --> 00:33:37,799
can't talk unless it's at a timing like that.It's like "
 

1106
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:39,850
can't talk unless it's at a timing like that.It's like "
Friday," Sakamoto says, "It's

1107
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:39,860
Friday," Sakamoto says, "It's
 

1108
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:43,610
Friday," Sakamoto says, "It's
really Friday."

1109
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:43,620
really Friday."
 

1110
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:46,669
really Friday."
Even if you tell me not to worry and it's okay, I

1111
00:33:46,669 --> 00:33:46,679
Even if you tell me not to worry and it's okay, I
 

1112
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:47,750
Even if you tell me not to worry and it's okay, I
think I'll get upset, but I

1113
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:47,760
think I'll get upset, but I
 

1114
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,909
think I'll get upset, but I
totally understand how you feel, and I

1115
00:33:49,909 --> 00:33:49,919
totally understand how you feel, and I
 

1116
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,630
totally understand how you feel, and I
wonder if it's okay.It's amazing.  I

1117
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:53,640
wonder if it's okay.It's amazing.  I
 

1118
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,149
wonder if it's okay.It's amazing.  I
know you're giving me too much perspective, but I'm wondering

1119
00:33:56,149 --> 00:33:56,159
know you're giving me too much perspective, but I'm wondering
 

1120
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,009
know you're giving me too much perspective, but I'm wondering
if you're forcing yourself to open it or

1121
00:33:58,009 --> 00:33:58,019
if you're forcing yourself to open it or
 

1122
00:33:58,019 --> 00:34:01,789
if you're forcing yourself to open it or
something like that.It

1123
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:01,799
something like that.It
 

1124
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:04,190
something like that.It
would be nice if it was someone you had a really close relationship with,

1125
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:04,200
would be nice if it was someone you had a really close relationship with,
 

1126
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,230
would be nice if it was someone you had a really close relationship with,
but it would be fine if you were from the same generation.  But if

1127
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:06,240
but it would be fine if you were from the same generation.  But if
 

1128
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,669
but it would be fine if you were from the same generation.  But if
it was anything else, they might try to make it happen,

1129
00:34:07,669 --> 00:34:07,679
it was anything else, they might try to make it happen,
 

1130
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:08,889
it was anything else, they might try to make it happen,
but there

1131
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:11,530
but there
 

1132
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:11,540

 

1133
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:15,409

are so many things that would be impossible.

1134
00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:15,419
are so many things that would be impossible.
 

1135
00:34:15,419 --> 00:34:21,710
are so many things that would be impossible.
But I want to do it. After all, I have to have the courage to do it.  I

1136
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,329

 

1137
00:34:23,329 --> 00:34:25,730

 

1138
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:25,740

 

1139
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:29,690

think about all sorts of fun possibilities, but I

1140
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:29,700
think about all sorts of fun possibilities, but I
 

1141
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,510
think about all sorts of fun possibilities, but I
try not to think about them. That's why I

1142
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:32,520
try not to think about them. That's why I
 

1143
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,290
try not to think about them. That's why I

1144
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:33,300

 

1145
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,909

suddenly

1146
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:34,919
suddenly
 

1147
00:34:34,919 --> 00:34:37,629
suddenly
end up waiting for a convection on a morning like this.

1148
00:34:37,629 --> 00:34:37,639
end up waiting for a convection on a morning like this.
 

1149
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:42,230
end up waiting for a convection on a morning like this.
People who do it at this hour just because of this are idiots.  I do

1150
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:43,510
People who do it at this hour just because of this are idiots.  I do
 

1151
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:47,570

 

1152
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:47,580

 

1153
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:51,470

n't have any appointments on time, so it's

1154
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:51,480

 

1155
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,810

extreme, isn't it

1156
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:52,820
extreme, isn't it
 

1157
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:57,650
extreme, isn't it
? I want something in the middle. Anything is extreme, really. If I

1158
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:57,660
? I want something in the middle. Anything is extreme, really. If I
 

1159
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,690
? I want something in the middle. Anything is extreme, really. If I
decide to do something like this, it'll get really expensive,

1160
00:34:59,690 --> 00:34:59,700
decide to do something like this, it'll get really expensive,
 

1161
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:03,070
decide to do something like this, it'll get really expensive,
so I want something like

so I want something like
 

1163
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,910
so I want something like
this.  You do

1164
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:04,920
this.  You do
 

1165
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,910
this.  You do
n't have to shake it off, you say it's

1166
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:07,920

 

1167
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,609

too much, but we

1168
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:10,619
too much, but we
 

1169
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:14,450
too much, but we
avoided 0, so that's true.

1170
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:14,460
avoided 0, so that's true.
 

1171
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,430
avoided 0, so that's true.
Thanks to Kihara-senpai, there are no longer 0 people.

1177
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,910

going to stick a needle over there.  I tried to tell everyone that I would probably never end up at this table,

00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:40,640
but
 

1186
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:47,210
but
they're all just friends.

1187

1194
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,790

I heard that you all have friends, so I wanted to know how you make friends, so how do you make friends? No, you guys didn't say anything, I just asked how you make friends.  I'm

1195
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:10,800
I heard that you all have friends, so I wanted to know how you make friends, so how do you make friends? No, you guys didn't say anything, I just asked how you make friends.  I'm

I heard that you all have friends, so I wanted to know how you make friends, so how do you make friends? No, you guys didn't say anything, I just asked how you make friends.  I'm
already too jealous of people who can say that.

1197
00:36:13,609 --> 00:36:13,619
already too jealous of people who can say that.

Because you say things like this, you say things like this. Do
n't you get misunderstood? I'm serious, Sakamoto.

Even when I talk to many of my seniors, I get told that I

want to do that. So I'll just
 

1253
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,690
want to do that. So I'll just
do that moderate thing.  I'm

Survival game. I want to see Hololive, which is a survival game. But it's
a little

1274
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:10,800
a little
 

1275
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,230
a little
scary. Hit

1276
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:15,240

 

1277
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,930

judgment.

1278
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:24,790
judgment.
 

1279
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:24,800

 

1280
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:29,990

Button-senpai is clearly the stronger one.

1281
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:30,000

 

1282
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,990

But there are a lot of things going on

1283
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:33,000
But there are a lot of things going on
 

1284
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,790
But there are a lot of things going on
with Sakamoto.The

1285
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:34,800
with Sakamoto.The
 

1286
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,130
with Sakamoto.The
problem is that when I ask someone out and they

1287
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:37,140
problem is that when I ask someone out and they
 

1288
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:41,030
problem is that when I ask someone out and they
say it's totally fine, when I

1289
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:41,040
say it's totally fine, when I
 

1290
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,849
say it's totally fine, when I
really want to invite them and I think about what to do with them, I just can't think of anything to do with them,

1291
00:38:43,849 --> 00:38:46,010
really want to invite them and I think about what to do with them, I just can't think of anything to do with them,
 

1292
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:46,020

 

1293
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,990

so I

1294
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:48,000
so I
 

1295
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,030
so I
end up not being able to invite them.  Well, that's exactly what I

1296
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:53,040
end up not being able to invite them.  Well, that's exactly what I
 

1297
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:57,470
end up not being able to invite them.  Well, that's exactly what I
wanted.At that time, I went

1298
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:57,480
wanted.At that time, I went
 

1299
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,470
wanted.At that time, I went
to Mikochi Sakamoto and said, ``

1300
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:00,480
to Mikochi Sakamoto and said, ``
 

1301
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,390
to Mikochi Sakamoto and said, ``
Wouldn't it be okay if I asked you out?''Even

1302
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:02,400
Wouldn't it be okay if I asked you out?''Even
 

1303
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,490
Wouldn't it be okay if I asked you out?''Even
though I was

1304
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:04,500
though I was
 

1305
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,890
though I was
okay with nicotine, I was like, ``Oh no.''

1306
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:06,900
okay with nicotine, I was like, ``Oh no.''
 

1307
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,550
okay with nicotine, I was like, ``Oh no.''
What should I do? I

1308
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:13,550
What should I do? I
 

1309
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:13,560

 

1310
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:17,990

was thinking, ``I wonder if I can come up with something interesting?'' and then Kobe-senpai came

1311
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:18,000
was thinking, ``I wonder if I can come up with something interesting?'' and then Kobe-senpai came
 

1312
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,690
was thinking, ``I wonder if I can come up with something interesting?'' and then Kobe-senpai came
up to me and said

1313
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:22,910
up to me and said
 

1314
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:22,920

 

1315
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:27,010

let's do a collaboration.

1316
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:31,970

 

1317
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:31,980

 

1318
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:35,450

So it's true, maybe. I'm overthinking it. I'm

1319
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:35,460
So it's true, maybe. I'm overthinking it. I'm
 

1320
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,550
So it's true, maybe. I'm overthinking it. I'm
not serious. I'm not serious at all.

1321
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:37,560
not serious. I'm not serious at all.
 

1322
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,910
not serious. I'm not serious at all.
But I don't know if I'm going to think about it. I'm sure I'm going to think about it. But now I have no choice but to

1323
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:46,550
But I don't know if I'm going to think about it. I'm sure I'm going to think about it. But now I have no choice but to
 

1324
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:46,560

 

1325
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,310

invite you, so I'll invite you.  That

1326
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:48,320
invite you, so I'll invite you.  That
 

1327
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:54,010
invite you, so I'll invite you.  That
's right,

1328
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:54,020

 

1329
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:56,930

Mr.

1330
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:56,940
Mr.
 

1331
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:59,510
Mr.
Sakamoto. What I was thinking before was that I wanted to

1332
00:39:59,510 --> 00:39:59,520
Sakamoto. What I was thinking before was that I wanted to
 

1333
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:04,370
Sakamoto. What I was thinking before was that I wanted to
take out a close-up and have an extremely long experience playing with that deathly holocaust without making an appointment.  I

1334
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:08,109
take out a close-up and have an extremely long experience playing with that deathly holocaust without making an appointment.  I
 

1335
00:40:08,109 --> 00:40:13,370

 

1336
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:15,069

 

1337
00:40:15,069 --> 00:40:18,470

 

1338
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:20,990

 

1339
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:21,000

 

1340
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,290

thought I'd like to make a schedule for that time and have them fight instead of changing, but only have them fight in one type, but that's just the

1341
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:24,300
thought I'd like to make a schedule for that time and have them fight instead of changing, but only have them fight in one type, but that's just the
 

1342
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:27,290
thought I'd like to make a schedule for that time and have them fight instead of changing, but only have them fight in one type, but that's just the
way Momotaro is.  I

1343
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:29,210
way Momotaro is.  I
 

1344
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:31,970

 

1345
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:33,010

 

1346
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:37,190

 

1347
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:37,200

 

1348
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,250

thought, ``Isn't this amazing thing to do when the time schedule is so different?'' I thought, ``I wonder if it's going to be dangerous if I use a lot more,'' and then I thought, ``It's a relay,'' and then I

1349
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:40,260
thought, ``Isn't this amazing thing to do when the time schedule is so different?'' I thought, ``I wonder if it's going to be dangerous if I use a lot more,'' and then I thought, ``It's a relay,'' and then I
 

1350
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:44,690
thought, ``Isn't this amazing thing to do when the time schedule is so different?'' I thought, ``I wonder if it's going to be dangerous if I use a lot more,'' and then I thought, ``It's a relay,'' and then I
thought it would be a little difficult.But it

1351
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:44,700

 

1352
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:49,730

seemed interesting.  Right, that

1353
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:49,740

 

1354
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:52,970

sounds interesting. That's why Karuta-senpai is

1355
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:58,190
sounds interesting. That's why Karuta-senpai is
 

1356
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:58,200

 

1357
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,370

so easy to invite. He's been using LINE a lot lately, and that's today.

1358
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:01,380
so easy to invite. He's been using LINE a lot lately, and that's today.
 

1359
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:04,010
so easy to invite. He's been using LINE a lot lately, and that's today.
Maybe he didn't say that, but it's today.  I

1360
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:04,020
Maybe he didn't say that, but it's today.  I
 

1361
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,470
Maybe he didn't say that, but it's today.  I

1362
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:09,950

 

1363
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:13,750

 

1364
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:18,170

 

1365
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:19,430

 

1366
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:21,170

 

1367
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:21,180

 

1368
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:24,290

heard that I'm going to do a collaboration stream with Harada-senpai at night, and I'm thinking of doing Minecraft on the stream as well, and I'm thinking of going to an underwater temple, so there's a lot of things going on. It's Karata-senpai, and he's like, ``Let's do this, let's do that.''  I have a plan in place, so please

take care of it.Well, according to the plan, it will probably
be an early night, around 7pm,

1373

be an early night, around 7pm,
 

1374

went to sleep, I finally received an additional Holo

1398
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:05,760
went to sleep, I finally received an additional Holo
 

1399
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,550
went to sleep, I finally received an additional Holo
Live wafer.  I

1400
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:09,230
Live wafer.  I
 

1401
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:11,270

1404
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:16,790

ordered the Hololive wafers with a strong desire to pull myself out of them if I grabbed them, so I could

1405
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:16,800
ordered the Hololive wafers with a strong desire to pull myself out of them if I grabbed them, so I could
 

1406
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,569
ordered the Hololive wafers with a strong desire to pull myself out of them if I grabbed them, so I could
open about 6

00:42:20,569 --> 00:42:20,579
open about 6
 

1408
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:23,210
open about 6
boxes of them.I had made some changes to those roses, so I was

00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:23,220
boxes of them.I had made some changes to those roses, so I was
 

1410
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:25,370
boxes of them.I had made some changes to those roses, so I was
hoping I could open up a lot.  That's why I

1411
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:25,380
hoping I could open up a lot.  That's why I
 

1412

opening it now.  I think it's

1419
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:39,770
opening it now.  I think it's
 

1420
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:39,780

 

1421
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:41,690

okay to have another revenge after broadcasting it,

1422
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:41,700

but I'm wondering if it's a good
 

1425
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,310
but I'm wondering if it's a good
idea to summarize it all, so I guess I'm just

1426
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:46,320
idea to summarize it all, so I guess I'm just
 

1427

can't digest it all, Sakamoto, that happened.  I
freeze it in a Ziploc bag and

tastes a little bland.Since it's a dairy
product, they started by adding salt.

but even I thought I was crazy because I hadn't taken a bath in 26 days. That's a good night's sleep. That's
too much. Are you

2858
01:24:31,910 --> 01:24:31,920

2865
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:40,550

Thank you for the laser. That's outrageous. Isn't there a molester

Thank you for the laser. That's outrageous. Isn't there a molester
 

2867

in the bath?  That's why I'm 26.

2868
01:24:45,350 --> 01:24:45,360
in the bath?  That's why I'm 26.
 

2869

in the bath?  That's why I'm 26.
Thank you for not telling a lie,

Thank you for not telling a lie,
 

2871
01:24:47,580 --> 01:24:50,209
Thank you for not telling a lie,
but I can't take a bath for some reason. It

2872
01:24:50,209 --> 01:24:50,219
but I can't take a bath for some reason. It
 

2873
01:24:50,219 --> 01:24:53,930
but I can't take a bath for some reason. It
seems like I have a tendency towards depression.

2874

seems like I have a tendency towards depression.
 

2875

At first, I really stopped taking baths,

2883
01:25:06,659 --> 01:25:09,169

uneasy about it, and it seems like I can't take a bath when it gets too expensive, so I thought maybe I wasn't taking a bath, and I thought it would be really hard to live here,

2884
01:25:09,169 --> 01:25:09,179
uneasy about it, and it seems like I can't take a bath when it gets too expensive, so I thought maybe I wasn't taking a bath, and I thought it would be really hard to live here,

uneasy about it, and it seems like I can't take a bath when it gets too expensive, so I thought maybe I wasn't taking a bath, and I thought it would be really hard to live here,
so I went to the hospital for a while.  I think it's a good idea to go.

2886
01:25:11,149 --> 01:25:14,090
so I went to the hospital for a while.  I think it's a good idea to go.

was there yesterday, and I
 

2894
01:25:20,340 --> 01:25:24,649
was there yesterday, and I
wonder if it's going to be there today, too. Pollen is annoying.

But when I'm sleeping, it's hard to sweat, but
 

2909
01:25:46,380 --> 01:25:48,830
But when I'm sleeping, it's hard to sweat, but
when I go out, I sweat a lot just by walking around,

2910
01:25:48,830 --> 01:25:48,840
when I go out, I sweat a lot just by walking around,
 

2911

01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:08,090

worst part was, I

2922
01:26:08,090 --> 01:26:08,100
worst part was, I
 

2923
01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:09,890
worst part was, I
thought I might miss the train, so I took a quick dash.I was

01:26:13,550 --> 01:26:13,560
really, really soaked.  I'm
 

2927
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:17,410
really, really soaked.  I'm
sure it was winter at that time of year, too. I

2928
01:26:17,410 --> 01:26:19,430
sure it was winter at that time of year, too. I
 

2929
01:26:19,430 --> 01:26:19,440

 

2930
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:21,530

01:26:21,530 --> 01:26:21,540
was drenched, and they made fun of me.
 

2932
01:26:21,540 --> 01:26:25,070

let's go to the hospital. Maybe it's because I
 

2950
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:53,149
let's go to the hospital. Maybe it's because I
don't like taking baths.  I feel like it's more than just not going in

fun when I go to a station that I don't know anything about.People who are just

3052
01:29:35,930 --> 01:29:35,940
fun when I go to a station that I don't know anything about.People who are just
 

3053
01:29:35,940 --> 01:29:38,570
fun when I go to a station that I don't know anything about.People who are just

3057
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:44,990
like watching people, and I see
people having a normal life.  Actually, when it comes to human resources, it's

3058
01:29:44,990 --> 01:29:45,000
people having a normal life.  Actually, when it comes to human resources, it's
 

3059
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,570
people having a normal life.  Actually, when it comes to human resources, it's
definitely different from my own world.Just because I

3060
01:29:47,570 --> 01:29:47,580
definitely different from my own world.Just because I
 

3061
01:29:47,580 --> 01:29:50,689
definitely different from my own world.Just because I
'm in a different area, I guess the way of life is

3062
01:29:50,689 --> 01:29:50,699
'm in a different area, I guess the way of life is
 

3063
01:29:50,699 --> 01:29:53,750
'm in a different area, I guess the way of life is
different, and each person has their own

3064
01:29:53,750 --> 01:29:53,760
different, and each person has their own
 

3065
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:57,410
different, and each person has their own
family environment and what they're aiming for.  I was

3066
01:29:57,410 --> 01:29:59,870
family environment and what they're aiming for.  I was
 

3067
01:29:59,870 --> 01:30:02,689

3070
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:07,910

thinking, ``I wonder if all kinds of things are different, and maybe someone is on the move at this time, or someone is on vacation,'' and I thought, ``It's kind of interesting.'' I

3071
01:30:07,910 --> 01:30:07,920

3074
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:14,510
thought, ``I saw something amazing.''  I
think it's good to get off at different stations because it's fun.

3075
01:30:14,510 --> 01:30:14,520

Yes, Arashi has a sense of adventure. I
think it's fun, but when I feel a little

3079
01:30:20,270 --> 01:30:20,280
think it's fun, but when I feel a little
 

3080
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:23,090
think it's fun, but when I feel a little
tired, I try getting off at a different station.

3081
01:30:23,090 --> 01:30:23,100
tired, I try getting off at a different station.
 

3082

Even just going for a walk from a distance
 

3084
01:30:25,380 --> 01:30:28,610

so just taking a short walk is the usual

3091
01:30:38,570 --> 01:30:38,580
so just taking a short walk is the usual
 

3092
01:30:38,580 --> 01:30:41,990
so just taking a short walk is the usual
way to work.  It seems that just trying to look at a slightly different path is

3093
01:30:41,990 --> 01:30:42,000
way to work.  It seems that just trying to look at a slightly different path is
 

3094
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,390
way to work.  It seems that just trying to look at a slightly different path is
a little

3095
01:30:44,390 --> 01:30:44,400
a little
 

3096

That really is an incredible amount
 

3144
01:32:17,820 --> 01:32:20,570
That really is an incredible amount
of capacity. This is not the kind of capacity that you would be able to meet alone and do it alone.

3145
01:32:20,570 --> 01:32:20,580
of capacity. This is not the kind of capacity that you would be able to meet alone and do it alone.

3397
01:38:57,300 --> 01:39:02,209

Maybe I

3398

3399
01:39:02,219 --> 01:39:07,070

should go to the hospital.

Thank you very much. Don't say anything scary. It's

3402

Thank you very much. Don't say anything scary. It's
 

3403

3404
01:39:19,689 --> 01:39:21,850

 

3405
01:39:21,850 --> 01:39:21,860

 

3406
01:39:21,860 --> 01:39:27,370

definitely a home like that. Thank you very much. Thank you, Kuronya-chan, Nanno-san, for

3407
01:39:27,370 --> 01:39:27,380

 

3408
01:39:27,380 --> 01:39:29,810

buying the collaboration goods. I see.  It would be amazing

3409
01:39:29,810 --> 01:39:33,050
buying the collaboration goods. I see.  It would be amazing
 

3410
01:39:33,050 --> 01:39:33,060

 

3411
01:39:33,060 --> 01:39:35,390

if you could buy goods on the spot, because there would

3412
01:39:35,390 --> 01:39:35,400
if you could buy goods on the spot, because there would
 

3413
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:36,890
if you could buy goods on the spot, because there would
be long lines and it would be a hassle,

3414
01:39:36,890 --> 01:39:36,900
be long lines and it would be a hassle,
 

3415
01:39:36,900 --> 01:39:40,490
be long lines and it would be a hassle,
so now you can

3416
01:39:40,490 --> 01:39:40,500
so now you can
 

3417
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:43,189
so now you can
buy things in advance and pick them up like a holocart, so you can

3418
01:39:43,189 --> 01:39:43,199
buy things in advance and pick them up like a holocart, so you can
 

3419
01:39:43,199 --> 01:39:45,649
buy things in advance and pick them up like a holocart, so you can
use those tickets.

3420
01:39:45,649 --> 01:39:45,659
use those tickets.
 

3421
01:39:45,659 --> 01:39:47,510
use those tickets.
Therefore, the

3422
01:39:47,510 --> 01:39:47,520
Therefore, the
 

3423
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:49,669
Therefore, the
pick-up time seems to vary depending on whether the regular ticket is a premium ticket or not,

3424
01:39:49,669 --> 01:39:49,679
pick-up time seems to vary depending on whether the regular ticket is a premium ticket or not,
 

3425
01:39:49,679 --> 01:39:52,010
pick-up time seems to vary depending on whether the regular ticket is a premium ticket or not,
so I think it would be the smoothest if you could buy it a little in advance and

3426
01:39:52,010 --> 01:39:52,020
so I think it would be the smoothest if you could buy it a little in advance and
 

3427
01:39:52,020 --> 01:39:54,290
so I think it would be the smoothest if you could buy it a little in advance and
pick it up at that time.

3428
01:39:54,290 --> 01:39:57,110
pick it up at that time.
 

3429
01:39:57,110 --> 01:39:57,120

 

3430
01:39:57,120 --> 01:39:59,750
