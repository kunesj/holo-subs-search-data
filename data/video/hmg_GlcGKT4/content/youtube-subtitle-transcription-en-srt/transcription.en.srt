00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:28,740
okay okay okay
 

1737
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:31,010
okay okay okay
so uh

1738
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:31,020
so uh
 

1739
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:32,870
so uh
uh it would be

1740
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:32,880
uh it would be
 

1741
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,450
uh it would be
if this is clockwise

1742
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:35,460
if this is clockwise
 

1743
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:37,609
if this is clockwise
then first we go

1744
00:48:37,609 --> 00:48:37,619
then first we go
 

1745
00:48:37,619 --> 00:48:40,250
then first we go
uh we turn ah wait are we turning this

1746
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:40,260
uh we turn ah wait are we turning this
 

1747
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:43,130
uh we turn ah wait are we turning this
piece of map

1748
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:43,140

 

1749
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:46,670

so once we turn it to the right then we

1750
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:46,680
so once we turn it to the right then we
 

1751
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:49,490
so once we turn it to the right then we
turn it twice the left then we turn it

1752
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:49,500
turn it twice the left then we turn it
 

1753
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:52,190
turn it twice the left then we turn it
price to the right then we turn it fries

1754
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:52,200
price to the right then we turn it fries
 

1755
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,470
price to the right then we turn it fries
to the left then we turn it once to the

1756
00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:54,480
to the left then we turn it once to the
 

1757
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,470
to the left then we turn it once to the
right

1758
00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:56,480
right
 

1759
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:00,410
right
uh does anyone remember that

1760
00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:00,420
uh does anyone remember that
 

1761
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:02,390
uh does anyone remember that
I think

1762
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:02,400
I think
 

1763
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,829
I think
so

1764
00:49:03,829 --> 00:49:03,839
so
 

1765
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:06,710
so
once oh

1766
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:06,720
once oh
 

1767
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:10,130
