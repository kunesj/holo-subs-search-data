23458
11:03:03,180 --> 11:03:05,630
was really just fine I could have gone
with classic but then if we would have

23459
11:03:05,630 --> 11:03:05,640
with classic but then if we would have
 

23460
11:03:05,640 --> 11:03:07,490
with classic but then if we would have
gone with classic we would have been

23461
11:03:07,490 --> 11:03:07,500
gone with classic we would have been
 

23462
11:03:07,500 --> 11:03:09,406
gone with classic we would have been
probably even more careful but we never

23463
11:03:09,406 --> 11:03:09,416
probably even more careful but we never
 

23464
11:03:09,416 --> 11:03:13,790
probably even more careful but we never
ran out of rewinds so but even then uh

23465
11:03:13,790 --> 11:03:13,800
ran out of rewinds so but even then uh
 

23466
11:03:13,800 --> 11:03:15,470
ran out of rewinds so but even then uh
yeah if we really wanted to keep

23467
11:03:15,470 --> 11:03:15,480
yeah if we really wanted to keep
 

23468
11:03:15,480 --> 11:03:16,790
yeah if we really wanted to keep
everyone we would have probably

23469
11:03:16,790 --> 11:03:16,800
everyone we would have probably
 

23470
11:03:16,800 --> 11:03:19,550
everyone we would have probably
eventually run out of rewinds at some

23471
11:03:19,550 --> 11:03:19,560
eventually run out of rewinds at some
 

23472
11:03:19,560 --> 11:03:20,870
eventually run out of rewinds at some
point somewhere

23473
11:03:20,870 --> 11:03:20,880
point somewhere
 

23474
11:03:20,880 --> 11:03:23,570

next time classic yeah if I play another

23475
11:03:23,570 --> 11:03:23,580
next time classic yeah if I play another
 

23476
11:03:23,580 --> 11:03:26,570
next time classic yeah if I play another
five limb game sometime if another one

23477
11:03:26,570 --> 11:03:26,580
five limb game sometime if another one
 

23478
11:03:26,580 --> 11:03:28,086
five limb game sometime if another one
comes out

23479
11:03:28,086 --> 11:03:28,096
comes out
 

23480
11:03:28,096 --> 11:03:31,370
comes out
uh during my time hold on then I think

23481
11:03:31,370 --> 11:03:31,380
uh during my time hold on then I think
 

23482
11:03:31,380 --> 11:03:33,406
uh during my time hold on then I think
I'm I'm gonna try classic and I won't

23483
11:03:33,406 --> 11:03:33,416
I'm I'm gonna try classic and I won't

23488
11:03:39,000 --> 11:03:41,926
for sure you will not run out of units I
mean if they continue like this

23489
11:03:41,926 --> 11:03:41,936
mean if they continue like this
 

23490
11:03:41,936 --> 11:03:44,926
