a syrup

4782
01:58:22,390 --> 01:58:22,400
a syrup
 

4783
01:58:22,400 --> 01:58:24,870

in a big plastic bottle and that's not

4786
01:58:27,750 --> 01:58:27,760
in a big plastic bottle and that's not
 

4787
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:30,550
in a big plastic bottle and that's not
carbonated so i think the chances of it

4788
01:58:30,550 --> 01:58:30,560
carbonated so i think the chances of it
 

4789
01:58:30,560 --> 01:58:33,910
carbonated so i think the chances of it
like you know exploding would be lower

like you know exploding would be lower
 

4791
01:58:33,920 --> 01:58:36,470
like you know exploding would be lower
and with the syrup you can make way more

4792
01:58:36,470 --> 01:58:36,480
and with the syrup you can make way more
 

4793
01:58:36,480 --> 01:58:40,790
and with the syrup you can make way more
of it than with just one bottle

4794
01:58:40,790 --> 01:58:40,800
