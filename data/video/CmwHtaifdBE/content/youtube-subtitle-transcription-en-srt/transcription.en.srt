in America is on this right side is
 

2009
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:26,270
in America is on this right side is
because that most of these here are

2010
00:56:26,270 --> 00:56:26,280
because that most of these here are
 

2011
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:29,390
because that most of these here are
[\h__\h] hot and deserty which means that

2012
00:56:29,390 --> 00:56:29,400
[\h__\h] hot and deserty which means that
 

2013
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,790
[\h__\h] hot and deserty which means that
Las Vegas and all that would be in this

2014
00:56:31,790 --> 00:56:31,800
Las Vegas and all that would be in this
 

2015
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:32,870
Las Vegas and all that would be in this
area

2016
00:56:32,870 --> 00:56:32,880
area
 

2017
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:37,150
area
because I know it's deserty so let's say

2018
00:56:37,150 --> 00:56:37,160
because I know it's deserty so let's say
 

2019
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,890
because I know it's deserty so let's say
uh Nevada is here

2020
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:39,900
uh Nevada is here

2047
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:25,549
this [\h__\h] looks so weird
all of those look so weird

2048
00:57:25,549 --> 00:57:25,559

 

2049
00:57:25,559 --> 00:57:27,829
