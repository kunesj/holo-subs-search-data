because
 

3415
01:40:26,820 --> 01:40:29,629
because
she has done that uh cooking streams

just like me a couple times before so it

3418
01:40:32,629 --> 01:40:32,639

3419
01:40:32,639 --> 01:40:35,209
just like me a couple times before so it
makes sense

3420
01:40:35,209 --> 01:40:35,219

3421
01:40:35,219 --> 01:40:36,350

definitely on the 23rd and if possible
maybe on the 24th before my family comes

6492
03:08:22,250 --> 03:08:22,260
maybe on the 24th before my family comes
 

6493
03:08:22,260 --> 03:08:24,830
maybe on the 24th before my family comes
but they might come kind of early

6494
03:08:24,830 --> 03:08:24,840
but they might come kind of early
 

6495
03:08:24,840 --> 03:08:27,230

03:08:30,650 --> 03:08:30,660
again of course
 

6501
03:08:30,660 --> 03:08:34,490
again of course
but while they're here I don't know yeah

6502
03:08:34,490 --> 03:08:34,500
but while they're here I don't know yeah
 

6503
03:08:34,500 --> 03:08:39,349

the 24th or 25th anyway because

6526
03:09:10,910 --> 03:09:10,920
the 24th or 25th anyway because
 

6527
03:09:10,920 --> 03:09:14,929
the 24th or 25th anyway because

03:21:28,670 --> 03:21:28,680
Expectations by doing it for such a long
 

7059
03:21:28,680 --> 03:21:30,290

um it shouldn't become the norm because
 

7065
03:21:34,920 --> 03:21:37,550
um it shouldn't become the norm because
it is difficult especially if you try to

7066
03:21:37,550 --> 03:21:37,560
it is difficult especially if you try to
 

7067
03:21:37,560 --> 03:21:40,490
it is difficult especially if you try to
include everyone so I think it's okay

7068
03:21:40,490 --> 03:21:40,500
include everyone so I think it's okay
 

7069
03:21:40,500 --> 03:21:41,510
include everyone so I think it's okay
