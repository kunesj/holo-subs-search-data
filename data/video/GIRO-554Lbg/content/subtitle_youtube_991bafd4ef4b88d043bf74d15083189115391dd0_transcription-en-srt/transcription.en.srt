um
 

1023
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:05,450
um
okay I don't think we'll find it

1024
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:05,460

 

1025
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,789

doesn't

1026
00:26:06,789 --> 00:26:06,799
doesn't
 

1027
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:10,190
doesn't
despawn in like five minutes probably is

1028
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:10,200
despawn in like five minutes probably is
 

1029
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,930
despawn in like five minutes probably is
there a radius like if we know a block

1030
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:11,940
there a radius like if we know a block
 

1031
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,269
there a radius like if we know a block
radius then we can do like a you know a

1032
00:26:14,269 --> 00:26:14,279
radius then we can do like a you know a
 

1033
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:15,710
radius then we can do like a you know a
circular sweep

1034
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:15,720
circular sweep
 

1035
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,789
circular sweep
but

1036
00:26:19,789 --> 00:26:19,799

 

1037
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:21,590

all right Chad maybe it goes the other

1038
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:21,600
all right Chad maybe it goes the other
 

1039
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,930
all right Chad maybe it goes the other
blocks so we can calculate from where

1040
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:23,940
blocks so we can calculate from where
 

1041
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,970
blocks so we can calculate from where
you know through it and then we can set

1042
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:25,980
you know through it and then we can set
 

1043
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:28,669
you know through it and then we can set
up a point but maybe maybe throw another

1044
00:26:28,669 --> 00:26:28,679
up a point but maybe maybe throw another
 

1045
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:30,950
up a point but maybe maybe throw another
one it didn't go that far because it

1046
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:30,960
one it didn't go that far because it
 

1047
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,769
one it didn't go that far because it
pinged really quickly

1048
00:26:33,769 --> 00:26:33,779
pinged really quickly
 

1049
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:36,890
pinged really quickly
and it has 10 to 15 blocks okay so let's

1050
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:36,900
and it has 10 to 15 blocks okay so let's
 

1051
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,690
and it has 10 to 15 blocks okay so let's
go back to the original one and then

1052
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:38,700
go back to the original one and then
 

1053
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,690
go back to the original one and then
search 10 to 15 blocks away from the

1054
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:41,700
search 10 to 15 blocks away from the
 

1055
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,210
search 10 to 15 blocks away from the
corner that you know threw it okay so

1056
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:44,220
corner that you know threw it okay so
 

1057
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:48,950
corner that you know threw it okay so
close yeah that is pretty close

1058
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:48,960

 

1059
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,649

I'm sure we're just missing it it could

1060
00:26:51,649 --> 00:26:51,659
I'm sure we're just missing it it could
 

1061
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:53,390
I'm sure we're just missing it it could
have broken apparently

1062
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:53,400
have broken apparently
 

1063
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,850
have broken apparently
ah yeah that's true they break sometimes

1064
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:55,860
ah yeah that's true they break sometimes
 

1065
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,789
ah yeah that's true they break sometimes
right away I'll say it probably this is

1066
00:26:58,789 --> 00:26:58,799
right away I'll say it probably this is
 

1067
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,430
right away I'll say it probably this is
probably broken

1068
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:01,440
probably broken
 

1069
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,289
probably broken
okay I'm gonna group up and throw

1070
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:03,299
okay I'm gonna group up and throw
 

1071
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:06,549
okay I'm gonna group up and throw
another one everyone

1072
00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:06,559

 

1073
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,870

you can see which way it goes I'm coming

1074
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:08,880
you can see which way it goes I'm coming
 

1075
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,970
you can see which way it goes I'm coming
back to uh Cara's roof or why on the

yeah it actually literally just jumped
 

1101
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:49,549
yeah it actually literally just jumped
beer are we all using shaders somebody

1102
00:27:49,549 --> 00:27:49,559
beer are we all using shaders somebody
 

1103
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:56,169
beer are we all using shaders somebody
says it went down

1104
00:27:56,169 --> 00:27:56,179

 

1105
00:27:56,179 --> 00:27:58,909

I wonder if it is a shaders thing what

1106
00:27:58,909 --> 00:27:58,919
I wonder if it is a shaders thing what
 

1107
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:00,409
I wonder if it is a shaders thing what
the hell

1108
00:28:00,409 --> 00:28:00,419
the hell
 

1109
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:03,169
the hell
no I turned off shaders

1110
00:28:03,169 --> 00:28:03,179
no I turned off shaders
 

1111
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:05,690
no I turned off shaders
uh are we right above it

1112
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:05,700
uh are we right above it
 

1113
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:09,649
uh are we right above it
no and there's no way there's no way

1114
00:28:09,649 --> 00:28:09,659
no and there's no way there's no way
 

1115
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:11,810
no and there's no way there's no way
then we then we would have probably like

1116
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:11,820
then we then we would have probably like
 

1117
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,529
then we then we would have probably like
dug into it yeah with uh Amelia's

1118
00:28:14,529 --> 00:28:14,539
dug into it yeah with uh Amelia's
 

1119
00:28:14,539 --> 00:28:17,090
dug into it yeah with uh Amelia's
underground Subway the cave turns way

1120
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:17,100
underground Subway the cave turns way
 

1121
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,190
underground Subway the cave turns way
further that way like to the left but

1122
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:19,200
further that way like to the left but
 

1123
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,630
further that way like to the left but
maybe we should dig straight down from

1124
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:20,640
maybe we should dig straight down from
 

1125
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,950
maybe we should dig straight down from
where you're throwing it in Kiara's

1126
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:21,960
where you're throwing it in Kiara's
 

1127

um
try dig down but

1138
00:28:39,289 --> 00:28:39,299
try dig down but
 

1139
00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:40,930
try dig down but
somebody says

1140
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:40,940
somebody says
 

1141
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:44,389
somebody says
it's not a good idea before we waste all

1142
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:44,399
it's not a good idea before we waste all
 

1143
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,970
it's not a good idea before we waste all
the pearls though should we there's no

1144
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:46,980
the pearls though should we there's no
 

1145
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:50,389
the pearls though should we there's no
ah all right let's dig I have one carpet

1146
00:28:50,389 --> 00:28:50,399
ah all right let's dig I have one carpet
 

1147
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,010
ah all right let's dig I have one carpet
wait throw it somewhere else where would

1148
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:52,020
wait throw it somewhere else where would
 

1149
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:54,529
wait throw it somewhere else where would
you try throwing it okay let's try maybe

1150
00:28:54,529 --> 00:28:54,539
you try throwing it okay let's try maybe
 

1151
00:28:54,539 --> 00:28:56,450
you try throwing it okay let's try maybe
let's go tomorrow let's go into a flat

1152
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:56,460
let's go tomorrow let's go into a flat
 

1153
