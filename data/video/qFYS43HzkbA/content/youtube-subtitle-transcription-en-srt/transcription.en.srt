like there's three different like angles
that you can play with in the game yeah

2848

that you can play with in the game yeah
but i pressed f1 and now everything's

2850
00:58:27,510 --> 00:58:27,520
but i pressed f1 and now everything's
 

2851
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:28,470
but i pressed f1 and now everything's
clear

2852
00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:28,480
clear
 

2853
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,150
clear
yeah yeah yeah that's for like taking a

2854
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:30,160
yeah yeah yeah that's for like taking a
 

2855
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:33,990
yeah yeah yeah that's for like taking a
good picture i guess yeah yeah oh

2856

good picture i guess yeah yeah oh
 

2857
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,549
good picture i guess yeah yeah oh
you mean you don't see the ah

2858
00:58:36,549 --> 00:58:36,559
you mean you don't see the ah
 

2859
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:38,789
you mean you don't see the ah
i think that's only with the shaders if

2860
00:58:38,789 --> 00:58:38,799
i think that's only with the shaders if
 

2861
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:42,309
i think that's only with the shaders if
you turn the shaders off then it um

2862
00:58:42,309 --> 00:58:42,319
you turn the shaders off then it um
 

2863
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:44,150
you turn the shaders off then it um
will not work i think that was a thing

2864
00:58:44,150 --> 00:58:44,160
will not work i think that was a thing
 

2865
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:44,950
will not work i think that was a thing
right

2866
00:58:44,950 --> 00:58:44,960

only with the shaders on
 

2871
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:51,190
only with the shaders on
which i guess you can keep the shaders

2872
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:51,200
which i guess you can keep the shaders
 

2873
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,870
which i guess you can keep the shaders
in the end we will see how it looks like

2874
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:52,880
in the end we will see how it looks like

uh
 

3853
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:17,750
uh
where is the next path that i built

3854
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:17,760

 

3855
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:19,990

so you know in the

3856
01:18:19,990 --> 01:18:20,000
so you know in the
 

3857
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,590
so you know in the
basically it's like a [\h__\h] ton of

3858
01:18:21,590 --> 01:18:21,600
basically it's like a [\h__\h] ton of
 

3859
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:25,350
basically it's like a [\h__\h] ton of
islands in the end and there are uh

3860
01:18:25,350 --> 01:18:25,360
islands in the end and there are uh
 

3861
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:27,669
islands in the end and there are uh
mostly not connected so we will have to

3862
01:18:27,669 --> 01:18:27,679
mostly not connected so we will have to
 

3863
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:29,510
mostly not connected so we will have to
build the paths this is a path that i i

3864
01:18:29,510 --> 01:18:29,520
build the paths this is a path that i i
 

3865
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:31,669
build the paths this is a path that i i
guess i built before

3866
01:18:31,669 --> 01:18:31,679
guess i built before
 

3867
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:32,470
guess i built before
uh

3868
01:18:32,470 --> 01:18:32,480
uh
 

3869
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:34,709

timer
 

3969
01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:25,270
timer
and it will wear off eventually but uh

lots of things to discover here
 

3975
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:33,990
lots of things to discover here
yeah well so far it's mostly nothingness

3976

5257
01:44:30,639 --> 01:44:32,390

a few more blocks yeah i don't see a

5258
01:44:32,390 --> 01:44:32,400
a few more blocks yeah i don't see a
 

5259
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:34,870
a few more blocks yeah i don't see a
bridge either but yeah that's why it

5260
01:44:34,870 --> 01:44:34,880
bridge either but yeah that's why it
 

5261
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:37,189
bridge either but yeah that's why it
could be myself because i just flew onto

5262
01:44:37,189 --> 01:44:37,199
could be myself because i just flew onto
 

5263
01:44:37,199 --> 01:44:40,070
could be myself because i just flew onto
those islands rather than bridging

5264
01:44:40,070 --> 01:44:40,080
those islands rather than bridging
 

5265
01:44:40,080 --> 01:44:42,709
those islands rather than bridging
oh yeah you can fly now so i guess yeah

5266
01:44:42,709 --> 01:44:42,719
oh yeah you can fly now so i guess yeah
 

5267
01:44:42,719 --> 01:44:44,629
oh yeah you can fly now so i guess yeah
it's it's a bit dangerous so people

5268
01:44:44,629 --> 01:44:44,639
it's it's a bit dangerous so people
 

5269
01:44:44,639 --> 01:44:46,229
it's it's a bit dangerous so people
don't recommend it so i did it off

5270
01:44:46,229 --> 01:44:46,239
don't recommend it so i did it off
 

5271
01:44:46,239 --> 01:44:47,990
don't recommend it so i did it off
stream

5272
01:44:47,990 --> 01:44:48,000
stream
 

5273
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,790
stream
because the chat will always go like

5274
01:44:50,790 --> 01:44:50,800
because the chat will always go like
 

5275
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:54,470
because the chat will always go like
no kiana is dangerous don't fly in the

5276
01:44:54,470 --> 01:44:54,480
no kiana is dangerous don't fly in the
 

5277
01:44:54,480 --> 01:44:59,189
no kiana is dangerous don't fly in the
end

5278
01:44:59,189 --> 01:44:59,199

 

5279
01:44:59,199 --> 01:45:01,669

i see i can see how it might be risky

5280
01:45:01,669 --> 01:45:01,679
i see i can see how it might be risky
 

5281
01:45:01,679 --> 01:45:04,390
i see i can see how it might be risky
yeah it is because like it loads in so

5282
01:45:04,390 --> 01:45:04,400
yeah it is because like it loads in so
 

5283
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:06,550
yeah it is because like it loads in so
slowly while you're flying so quickly

5284
01:45:06,550 --> 01:45:06,560
slowly while you're flying so quickly
 

5285
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:08,070
slowly while you're flying so quickly
and you might bump into something and

5286
01:45:08,070 --> 01:45:08,080
and you might bump into something and
 

5287
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:11,030
and you might bump into something and
die that's the thing yeah and fireworks

5288
01:45:11,030 --> 01:45:11,040
die that's the thing yeah and fireworks
 

5289
01:45:11,040 --> 01:45:12,550
die that's the thing yeah and fireworks
i mean i wonder how the flying thing

5290
01:45:12,550 --> 01:45:12,560
i mean i wonder how the flying thing
 

5291
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:14,229
i mean i wonder how the flying thing
works with like control and stuff like

5292
01:45:14,229 --> 01:45:14,239
works with like control and stuff like
 

5293
01:45:14,239 --> 01:45:16,070
works with like control and stuff like
that is it hard to control where you're

5294
01:45:16,070 --> 01:45:16,080
that is it hard to control where you're
 

5295
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:18,709
that is it hard to control where you're
flying it's pretty easy to control but

5296
01:45:18,709 --> 01:45:18,719
flying it's pretty easy to control but
 

5297
01:45:18,719 --> 01:45:20,310
flying it's pretty easy to control but
the thing is like most of the time when

5298
01:45:20,310 --> 01:45:20,320
the thing is like most of the time when
 

5299
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:23,669
the thing is like most of the time when
you fly everything loads in slower than

5300
01:45:23,669 --> 01:45:23,679
you fly everything loads in slower than
 

5301
01:45:23,679 --> 01:45:25,830
you fly everything loads in slower than
you fly so

5302
01:45:25,830 --> 01:45:25,840
you fly so
 

5303
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:28,470
you fly so
you might end up flying into a huge

5304
01:45:28,470 --> 01:45:28,480
you might end up flying into a huge
 

5305
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:32,550
you might end up flying into a huge
mountain and it kills you

5306

how long can you fly with one firework

7582
02:30:33,990 --> 02:30:34,000
how long can you fly with one firework
 

7583
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,309
how long can you fly with one firework
by the way um so there's uh three

7584
02:30:36,309 --> 02:30:36,319
by the way um so there's uh three
 

7585
02:30:36,319 --> 02:30:38,469
by the way um so there's uh three
different strengths of fireworks the one

7586
02:30:38,469 --> 02:30:38,479
different strengths of fireworks the one
 

7587
02:30:38,479 --> 02:30:40,469
different strengths of fireworks the one
that i gave you is the one that i always

7588
02:30:40,469 --> 02:30:40,479
that i gave you is the one that i always
 

7589
02:30:40,479 --> 02:30:42,790
that i gave you is the one that i always
use it's the weakest one but

7590
02:30:42,790 --> 02:30:42,800
use it's the weakest one but
 

7591
02:30:42,800 --> 02:30:45,030
use it's the weakest one but
i think and most people would agree with

7592
02:30:45,030 --> 02:30:45,040
i think and most people would agree with
 

7593
02:30:45,040 --> 02:30:47,910
i think and most people would agree with
me that that one is good enough

7594
02:30:47,910 --> 02:30:47,920
me that that one is good enough
 

7595
02:30:47,920 --> 02:30:50,790
me that that one is good enough
um so with that one

7596
02:30:50,790 --> 02:30:50,800
um so with that one
 

7597
02:30:50,800 --> 02:30:53,510
um so with that one
you get like a small boost and then you

7598
02:30:53,510 --> 02:30:53,520
you get like a small boost and then you
 

7599
02:30:53,520 --> 02:30:55,830
you get like a small boost and then you
can just glide until you

7600
02:30:55,830 --> 02:30:55,840
can just glide until you
 

7601
02:30:55,840 --> 02:30:57,910
can just glide until you
completely lose the

7602
02:30:57,910 --> 02:30:57,920
completely lose the
 

7603
02:30:57,920 --> 02:30:58,790
completely lose the
power

7604
02:30:58,790 --> 02:30:58,800
power
 

7605
02:30:58,800 --> 02:31:01,030
power
you will see in a moment when we

7606
02:31:01,030 --> 02:31:01,040
you will see in a moment when we
 

7607
