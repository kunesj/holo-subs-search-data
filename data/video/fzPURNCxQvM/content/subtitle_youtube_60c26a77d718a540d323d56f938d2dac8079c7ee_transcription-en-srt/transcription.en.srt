03:04:36,230 --> 03:04:36,240
unfortunate and so far I think as a
 

6875
03:04:36,240 --> 03:04:39,170
unfortunate and so far I think as a
character development I understand that

6876
03:04:39,170 --> 03:04:39,180
character development I understand that
 

6877
03:04:39,180 --> 03:04:42,110
character development I understand that

you know he looked up the Marines and
 

6879
03:04:42,120 --> 03:04:44,269
you know he looked up the Marines and
said so therefore wanted to become a

03:04:44,269 --> 03:04:44,279
said so therefore wanted to become a
 

6881
03:04:44,279 --> 03:04:46,730
said so therefore wanted to become a
Marine then he sees how

6882
03:04:46,730 --> 03:04:46,740

6883
03:04:46,740 --> 03:04:49,969
Marine then he sees how
they are though and they excuse it

6884
03:04:49,969 --> 03:04:49,979
they are though and they excuse it
 

6885
03:04:49,979 --> 03:04:51,769
they are though and they excuse it
because oh but you're gonna be one of

6886
03:04:51,769 --> 03:04:51,779
because oh but you're gonna be one of
 

6887
03:04:51,779 --> 03:04:55,070
because oh but you're gonna be one of
the good ones but I mean he's still

6888
03:04:55,070 --> 03:04:55,080
the good ones but I mean he's still
 

6889
03:04:55,080 --> 03:04:57,650
the good ones but I mean he's still
partaking in everything bad that they're

6890
03:04:57,650 --> 03:04:57,660
partaking in everything bad that they're
 

6891
03:04:57,660 --> 03:04:58,849
partaking in everything bad that they're
doing

6892
03:04:58,849 --> 03:04:58,859
doing
 

6893
03:04:58,859 --> 03:05:01,309
doing
and now I guess he's just getting more

6894
03:05:01,309 --> 03:05:01,319
and now I guess he's just getting more
 

6895
03:05:01,319 --> 03:05:03,230
and now I guess he's just getting more
and more

6896
03:05:03,230 --> 03:05:03,240
and more
 

6897
03:05:03,240 --> 03:05:07,070
