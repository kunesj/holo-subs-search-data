3901
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:50,709

now i will say that it was still a huge

3902
01:27:50,709 --> 01:27:50,719
now i will say that it was still a huge
 

3903
01:27:50,719 --> 01:27:52,790
now i will say that it was still a huge
[\h__\h] mess after that because we did

3904
01:27:52,790 --> 01:27:52,800
[\h__\h] mess after that because we did
 

3905
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:54,870
[\h__\h] mess after that because we did
not have forks

3906
01:27:54,870 --> 01:27:54,880
not have forks
 

3907
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:57,189
not have forks
i think yeah we only had knives did not

3908
01:27:57,189 --> 01:27:57,199
i think yeah we only had knives did not
 

3909
01:27:57,199 --> 01:27:58,870
i think yeah we only had knives did not
have spoons but you know we could have

3910
01:27:58,870 --> 01:27:58,880
have spoons but you know we could have
 

3911
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:00,709
have spoons but you know we could have
spooned it out there

3912
01:28:00,709 --> 01:28:00,719
spooned it out there
 

3913
01:28:00,719 --> 01:28:02,709
spooned it out there
no we had nothing

3914
01:28:02,709 --> 01:28:02,719
no we had nothing
 

3915
01:28:02,719 --> 01:28:04,470
no we had nothing
so

3916
01:28:04,470 --> 01:28:04,480
so
 

3917
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:08,070
so
we then got these

3918
01:28:08,070 --> 01:28:08,080

 

3919
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:09,030

plates then it would have really been
 

3943
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:38,390

and

4922
01:49:17,109 --> 01:49:17,119
and
 

4923
01:49:17,119 --> 01:49:20,229
and
the reason why i had that wound to begin

4924
01:49:20,229 --> 01:49:20,239
the reason why i had that wound to begin
 

4925
01:49:20,239 --> 01:49:22,470
the reason why i had that wound to begin
with was because of one of these shoes

4926
01:49:22,470 --> 01:49:22,480
with was because of one of these shoes
 

4927
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:24,709
with was because of one of these shoes
but this is really the only easy choice

4928
01:49:24,709 --> 01:49:24,719
but this is really the only easy choice
 

4929
01:49:24,719 --> 01:49:26,830
but this is really the only easy choice
you could get at that moment

4930
01:49:26,830 --> 01:49:26,840
you could get at that moment
 

4931
01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:31,430
you could get at that moment
but my wound was exactly here

4932
01:49:31,430 --> 01:49:31,440
but my wound was exactly here
 

4933
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:34,310

on a nice hotel
 

9979
03:43:56,080 --> 03:43:59,189
on a nice hotel
because in the hotel i feel like i spend

9980
03:43:59,189 --> 03:43:59,199
because in the hotel i feel like i spend
 

9981
03:43:59,199 --> 03:44:01,349
because in the hotel i feel like i spend
more time

9982
03:44:01,349 --> 03:44:01,359
more time
 

9983
03:44:01,359 --> 03:44:03,349
more time
and then in the

9984
03:44:03,349 --> 03:44:03,359
and then in the
 

9985
03:44:03,359 --> 03:44:05,429
and then in the
in i mean it depends what kind of trip

9986
03:44:05,429 --> 03:44:05,439
in i mean it depends what kind of trip
 

9987
03:44:05,439 --> 03:44:07,750
in i mean it depends what kind of trip
it is like if it's like a resort trip

9988
03:44:07,750 --> 03:44:07,760
it is like if it's like a resort trip
 

9989
03:44:07,760 --> 03:44:09,349
it is like if it's like a resort trip
like to the maldives then you spend a

9990
03:44:09,349 --> 03:44:09,359
like to the maldives then you spend a
 

9991
03:44:09,359 --> 03:44:12,070
like to the maldives then you spend a
lot of time in the hotel

9992
03:44:12,070 --> 03:44:12,080
lot of time in the hotel
 

9993
03:44:12,080 --> 03:44:14,389
lot of time in the hotel
so then you can spend a lot of money on

9994
03:44:14,389 --> 03:44:14,399
so then you can spend a lot of money on
 

9995
03:44:14,399 --> 03:44:17,110
so then you can spend a lot of money on
a good resort if it's a city trip then

9996
03:44:17,110 --> 03:44:17,120
a good resort if it's a city trip then
 

9997
03:44:17,120 --> 03:44:19,269
a good resort if it's a city trip then
it still doesn't really matter much

9998
03:44:19,269 --> 03:44:19,279
it still doesn't really matter much
 

9999
03:44:19,279 --> 03:44:21,910
it still doesn't really matter much
just get a cheap hotel i guess

10000
03:44:21,910 --> 03:44:21,920
just get a cheap hotel i guess
 

10001
03:44:21,920 --> 03:44:23,349
just get a cheap hotel i guess
because you're gonna spend a lot of time

10002
03:44:23,349 --> 03:44:23,359
because you're gonna spend a lot of time
 

10003
03:44:23,359 --> 03:44:24,870
because you're gonna spend a lot of time
in the city anyway

10004
03:44:24,870 --> 03:44:24,880
in the city anyway
 

10005
03:44:24,880 --> 03:44:27,510
in the city anyway
but yeah i think it makes more sense

10006
03:44:27,510 --> 03:44:27,520
but yeah i think it makes more sense
 

10007
03:44:27,520 --> 03:44:30,950
but yeah i think it makes more sense
to uh book a nice hotel

10008
03:44:30,950 --> 03:44:30,960
to uh book a nice hotel
 

10009
03:44:30,960 --> 03:44:33,990
to uh book a nice hotel

then a nice flight um
 

10011
03:44:34,000 --> 03:44:35,990
then a nice flight um
yeah even though i mean i wish i if it

10012
03:44:35,990 --> 03:44:36,000
yeah even though i mean i wish i if it
 

10013
03:44:36,000 --> 03:44:38,389
yeah even though i mean i wish i if it
was if it was a bit cheaper if business

10014
03:44:38,389 --> 03:44:38,399
was if it was a bit cheaper if business
 

10015
03:44:38,399 --> 03:44:40,550
was if it was a bit cheaper if business
was like three thousand not five

10016
03:44:40,550 --> 03:44:40,560
was like three thousand not five
 

10017
03:44:40,560 --> 03:44:42,710
was like three thousand not five

thousand
 

10019
03:44:42,720 --> 03:44:44,710

then maybe i would consider

10020
03:44:44,710 --> 03:44:44,720
then maybe i would consider
 

10021
03:44:44,720 --> 03:44:47,110
then maybe i would consider
maybe but even then

the convention it was really unfortunate

11210

the convention it was really unfortunate
 

11211
04:19:32,080 --> 04:19:34,309
the convention it was really unfortunate
because that was the original reason we

11212
04:19:34,309 --> 04:19:34,319
because that was the original reason we
 

11213
04:19:34,319 --> 04:19:37,429
because that was the original reason we
went or we wanted to go

11214
04:19:37,429 --> 04:19:37,439
went or we wanted to go
 

11215

went or we wanted to go
but

11216
04:19:38,389 --> 04:19:38,399
but
 

11217
04:19:38,399 --> 04:19:40,790
but
in in hindsight as i said i think it was

11218
04:19:40,790 --> 04:19:40,800
in in hindsight as i said i think it was
 

11219
04:19:40,800 --> 04:19:43,510
in in hindsight as i said i think it was
actually better this way

11220
04:19:43,510 --> 04:19:43,520
actually better this way
 

11221
04:19:43,520 --> 04:19:44,469
actually better this way
yeah

11222
04:19:44,469 --> 04:19:44,479
yeah
 

11223
04:19:44,479 --> 04:19:46,309
yeah
because um

11224
04:19:46,309 --> 04:19:46,319
because um
 

11225
04:19:46,319 --> 04:19:48,740

it's just not the same anymore as it

11230
04:19:52,309 --> 04:19:52,319
it's just not the same anymore as it
 

11231
04:19:52,319 --> 04:19:55,750
it's just not the same anymore as it
used to be going to conventions

11232
04:19:55,750 --> 04:19:55,760
used to be going to conventions
 

11233
04:19:55,760 --> 04:20:00,550
used to be going to conventions
i i get very like nervous and paranoid

11234
04:20:00,550 --> 04:20:00,560
i i get very like nervous and paranoid
 

11235
04:20:00,560 --> 04:20:02,309
i i get very like nervous and paranoid
so

11236
04:20:02,309 --> 04:20:02,319
so
 

11237
04:20:02,319 --> 04:20:04,950
so
i always feel like watched and

11238
04:20:04,950 --> 04:20:04,960
i always feel like watched and
 

11239
04:20:04,960 --> 04:20:06,389
i always feel like watched and
um

11240
04:20:06,389 --> 04:20:06,399
um
 

11241
04:20:06,399 --> 04:20:08,469
um
like i always need to be careful and all

11242
04:20:08,469 --> 04:20:08,479
like i always need to be careful and all
 

11243
04:20:08,479 --> 04:20:09,910
like i always need to be careful and all
that

11244
04:20:09,910 --> 04:20:09,920
that
 

11245
04:20:09,920 --> 04:20:13,429
that
it's just i don't feel so free anymore

11246
04:20:13,429 --> 04:20:13,439
it's just i don't feel so free anymore
 

11247
04:20:13,439 --> 04:20:15,670
it's just i don't feel so free anymore
so in hindsight it's probably better

11248
04:20:15,670 --> 04:20:15,680
so in hindsight it's probably better
 

11249
04:20:15,680 --> 04:20:18,870
so in hindsight it's probably better
this way

11250
04:20:18,870 --> 04:20:18,880

 

11251
04:20:18,880 --> 04:20:25,510
