​​​ ​Ina, set the coordinates.​ ​​

165
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:31,968
​​​ ​Kiara, prepare the jump!​ ​​

166
00:07:31,968 --> 00:07:33,537
​​​ ​Sheriff and I call dibs on the guns!​ ​​

167
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:34,571
​​​ ​Hmm...​ ​​

168
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,440
​​​ ​This place could be dangerous.​ ​​

169
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,541
​​​ ​Hey, Ame.​ ​​

170
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:38,909
​​​ ​Ame, which button is it again?​ ​​

171
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:39,509
​​​ ​This one?​ ​​

172
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,855
​​​ ​That wasn't so bad...​ ​​

173
00:07:51,855 --> 00:07:54,858
​​​ ​AAAHHH AHH AHHHHH!​ ​​

174
00:07:54,858 --> 00:07:56,560
​​​ ​Calli, Calli! We're here!​ ​​

175
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,527
​​​ ​O-Oh...​ ​​

176
00:07:57,928 --> 00:07:58,929
​​​ ​I'm cool.​ ​​

177
00:07:58,929 --> 00:07:59,896
​​​ ​Sha-har-hark!​ ​​

178
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,799
​​​ ​You were all, like,​ ​​
​​ ​"Ooh! Ahh!"​ ​​

179
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:04,301
​​​ ​Grr!​ ​​
​​ ​Come here, you little...!​ ​​

180
00:08:04,301 --> 00:08:05,135
​​​ ​Suit up, ladies!​ ​​

181
00:08:05,135 --> 00:08:07,771
​​​ ​Radar's a-beepin' and we're goin' in!​ ​​

182
00:08:13,677 --> 00:08:15,479
​​​ ​Whew, we made it!​ ​​

183
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:17,314
​​​ ​It's kind of hot here...​ ​​

184
00:08:17,314 --> 00:08:18,982
​​​ ​Could make a good vacation spot!​ ​​

185
00:08:18,982 --> 00:08:21,318
​​​ ​Ooh! We could put​ ​​
​​ ​a kiddy pool over there!​ ​​

186
00:08:21,318 --> 00:08:23,520
​​​ ​And then... Oh, and over there,​ ​​
​​ ​we could put a cooler​ ​​

187
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,355
​​​ ​and have, like,​ ​​
​​ ​a bunch of drinks and stuff!​ ​​

188
00:08:25,355 --> 00:08:26,089
​​​ ​Ooh!​ ​​

189
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,691
​​​ ​A couple of beers!​ ​​

190
00:08:27,691 --> 00:08:30,227
​​​ ​Mmm! Some cold pudding...​ ​​

191
00:08:35,065 --> 00:08:36,066
​​​ ​Uh...​ ​​

192
00:08:36,066 --> 00:08:38,235
​​​ ​Here, Ina,​ ​​
​​ ​you've got the magic touch!​ ​​

193
00:08:38,702 --> 00:08:39,503
​​​ ​Humu humu...​ ​​

194
00:08:40,003 --> 00:08:40,670
​​​ ​This way!​ ​​

195
00:08:49,079 --> 00:08:50,547
​​​ ​This place is kind of spooky, guys...​ ​​

196
00:08:50,547 --> 00:08:52,349
​​​ ​Don't worry, I'll watch your backsides!​ ​​

197
00:08:52,349 --> 00:08:54,317
​​​ ​It reminds me of the Underworld a bit!​ ​​

198
00:08:54,317 --> 00:08:57,187
​​​ ​Ehh! Calli, I wanna go!​ ​​

199
00:08:57,187 --> 00:08:58,688
​​​ ​Kiara, we've talked about this!​ ​​

200
00:08:58,688 --> 00:09:01,157
​​​ ​The Underworld's no place​ ​​
​​ ​for someone who WON'T DIE!​ ​​

201
00:09:01,157 --> 00:09:01,825
​​​ ​But, why not?​ ​​

202
00:09:01,825 --> 00:09:04,728
​​​ ​I could sneak into your house​ ​​
​​ ​and surprise you, hehe!​ ​​

203
00:09:04,728 --> 00:09:06,363
​​​ ​Like old times!​ ​​

204
00:09:06,363 --> 00:09:07,797
​​​ ​What are you talking about?!​ ​​

205
00:09:08,098 --> 00:09:09,366
​​​ ​Wait, did you hear that?​ ​​

206
00:09:10,534 --> 00:09:13,036
​​​ ​Eh... It's probably just the wind. Oh!​ ​​

207
00:09:13,036 --> 00:09:14,738
​​​ ​That must be it!​ ​​

208
00:09:14,738 --> 00:09:18,441
​​​ ​It kinda looks like some sort of portal...​ ​​

209
00:09:18,441 --> 00:09:20,610
​​​ ​Or a big ol' snow globe!​ ​​

210
00:09:25,081 --> 00:09:28,151
​​​ ​I see something shiny inside!​ ​​

211
00:09:28,418 --> 00:09:30,453
​​​ ​Whew... Whew...​ ​​

212
00:09:30,453 --> 00:09:31,755
​​​ ​Just give me a sec!​ ​​

213
00:09:31,755 --> 00:09:33,790
​​​ ​Ooh! Let's investigate!​ ​​

214
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,593
​​​ ​But, try not to press​ ​​
​​ ​any weird switches or buttons.​ ​​

215
00:09:36,593 --> 00:09:37,827
​​​ ​Okay, guys?​ ​​

216
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,196
​​​ ​What's that big glowy rock in the middle?​ ​​

217
00:09:40,196 --> 00:09:42,499
​​​ ​Maybe it's some sort of bomb.​ ​​

218
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:44,200
​​​ ​I want to touch it...​ ​​

219
00:09:45,035 --> 00:09:46,736
​​​ ​Kiara, no! Watch out!​ ​​

220
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:49,506
​​​ ​What? Look!​ ​​

221
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:50,907
​​​ ​I'm fine!​ ​​

222
00:09:53,877 --> 00:09:56,680
​​​ ​Were you worried about me, Calli?​ ​​

223
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,847
​​​ ​Why you—​ ​​

224
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:02,385
​​​ ​Oh, wow, it actually​ ​​
​​ ​feels pretty nice in here!​ ​​

225
00:10:02,652 --> 00:10:04,220
​​​ ​Me too, me too, me too!​ ​​

226
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,556
​​​ ​Umm, I don't know if​ ​​
​​ ​we should go in there, you guys.​ ​​

227
00:10:06,957 --> 00:10:09,659
​​​ ​Ooh! There's a little thingy here!​ ​​

228
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:10,827
​​​ ​It says...​ ​​

229
00:10:10,827 --> 00:10:12,629
​​​ ​4...D?​ ​​

230
00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:15,265
​​​ ​Huh, I wonder what​ ​​
​<i>​ ​that </i>could mean.​ ​​

231
00:10:15,265 --> 00:10:16,700
​​​ ​It kinda feels nice in here, y'know?​ ​​

232
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,668
​​​ ​Like a, like a warm spot in the pool.​ ​​

233
00:10:18,668 --> 00:10:19,636
​​​ ​Hehe, y'know?​ ​​

234
00:10:20,604 --> 00:10:22,238
​​​ ​Hmm...​ ​​

235
00:10:22,238 --> 00:10:26,076
​​​ ​If the radar is beeping, that stone​ ​​
​​ ​could contain some valuable materials...​ ​​

236
00:10:26,076 --> 00:10:28,912
​​​ ​Let's try to take it back​ ​​
​​ ​to the ship and scan it!​ ​​

237
00:10:28,912 --> 00:10:29,779
​​​ ​I wanna take it!​ ​​

238
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:30,547
​​​ ​No, me!​ ​​

239
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:31,581
​​​ ​This rocks!​ ​​

240
00:10:31,581 --> 00:10:32,816
​​​ ​Hmm!​ ​​

241
00:10:32,816 --> 00:10:34,017
​​​ ​Don't break it, guys!​ ​​

242
00:10:34,017 --> 00:10:35,785
​​​ ​I'll keep watch out here—​ ​​

243
00:10:35,785 --> 00:10:36,686
​​​ ​What the...?​ ​​

244
00:10:36,686 --> 00:10:39,889
​​​ ​MUAHAHAHAHA!​ ​​

245
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,925
​​​ ​You guys fell for my trap!​ ​​

246
00:10:41,925 --> 00:10:43,426
​​​ ​What! Who said that?​ ​​

247
00:10:43,426 --> 00:10:44,628
​​​ ​Show yourself!​ ​​

248
00:10:44,628 --> 00:10:46,863
​​​ ​It is I, IRyS!​ ​​

249
00:10:46,863 --> 00:10:49,132
​​​ ​Here to deliver hope to the people!​ ​​

250
00:10:49,132 --> 00:10:51,101
​​​ ​What does that even mean? Why—​ ​​

251
00:10:51,101 --> 00:10:52,068
​​​ ​Wait.​ ​​

252
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:52,969
​​​ ​My hand's stuck!​ ​​

253
00:10:52,969 --> 00:10:53,703
​​​ ​Urgh...​ ​​

254
00:10:53,703 --> 00:10:54,504
​​​ ​Mine too!​ ​​

255
00:10:54,504 --> 00:10:56,106
​​​ ​Uh-oh!​ ​​

256
00:10:56,106 --> 00:10:58,341
​​​ ​Why are you doing this, IRyS?!​ ​​

257
00:10:58,341 --> 00:11:00,210
​​​ ​I'm just giving​ ​​
​​ ​the people what they want!​ ​​

258
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:01,645
​​​ ​Now, ta ta!​ ​​

259
00:11:01,645 --> 00:11:03,246
​​​ ​No-No, wait, wai—​ ​​

260
00:11:04,648 --> 00:11:06,983
​​​ ​Hehehehe!​ ​​

261
00:11:07,684 --> 00:11:08,218
​​​ ​Oof!​ ​​

262
00:11:08,218 --> 00:11:08,818
​​​ ​Ah!​ ​​

263
00:11:08,818 --> 00:11:09,119
​​​ ​Oof!​ ​​

264
00:11:09,119 --> 00:11:09,719
​​​ ​Eughh!​ ​​

265
00:11:09,719 --> 00:11:10,220
​​​ ​Oh!​ ​​

266
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,054
​​​ ​Oww!​ ​​

267
00:11:11,054 --> 00:11:12,022
​​​ ​Alley-oop!​ ​​

268
00:11:12,022 --> 00:11:13,423
​​​ ​Are you guys there?​ ​​

269
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,624
​​​ ​I can't see anything!​ ​​

270
00:11:14,624 --> 00:11:16,192
​​​ ​It's really dark!​ ​​

271
00:11:16,192 --> 00:11:17,093
​​​ ​Wait!​ ​​

272
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,295
​​​ ​Do you guys hear that?​ ​​

273
00:11:19,295 --> 00:11:20,964
​​​ ​I don't think we're alone...​ ​​

274
00:11:20,964 --> 00:11:22,065
​​​ ​SQUEEE!​ ​​

275
00:11:22,065 --> 00:11:24,601
​​​ ​Guys guys, I think we're on a stage!​ ​​

276
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:25,769
​​​ ​Oh mah gawd!​ ​​

277
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:26,936
​​​ ​A what now?​ ​​

278
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,706
​​​ ​Mina! POSE-U!​ ​​

279
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:35,979
​​​ ​Oh boy, I am not ready for this!​ ​​

280
00:11:35,979 --> 00:11:37,981
​​​ ​My tail feels so real!​ ​​

281
00:11:37,981 --> 00:11:38,782
​​​ ​Wow!​ ​​

282
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:40,150
​​​ ​I can't wait to dance!​ ​​

283
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,285
​​​ ​Is this mic on?​ ​​

284
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:43,687
​​​ ​Test test...​ ​​

285
00:11:43,687 --> 00:11:44,788
​​​ ​Wah!​ ​​

286
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:45,989
​​<i>​ ​Japanese fans!​ ​</i>​

287
00:11:45,989 --> 00:11:49,359
​​<i>​ ​Pay attention to us in 3D!​ ​</i>​
