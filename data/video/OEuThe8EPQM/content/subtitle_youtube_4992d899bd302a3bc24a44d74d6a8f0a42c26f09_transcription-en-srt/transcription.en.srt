area properly here before but let's
 

1077
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:54,029
area properly here before but let's
focus on the quest first I suppose and

1078
00:33:54,029 --> 00:33:54,039
focus on the quest first I suppose and
 

1079
00:33:54,039 --> 00:34:00,310
focus on the quest first I suppose and
then what I just like fall down here

1080
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:00,320

 

1081
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,629

1083
00:34:04,639 --> 00:34:09,230

I that seems kind of dangerous I feel

I that seems kind of dangerous I feel
 

1085
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:12,790
I that seems kind of dangerous I feel
like this might not go so well but okay

it's as close as it can
 

1089
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,109
it's as close as it can
be should I maybe spawn a he might um if

1090
00:34:20,109 --> 00:34:20,119
be should I maybe spawn a he might um if
 

1091
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:22,909
be should I maybe spawn a he might um if
I spawn a fire mob like in an area he

1092
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:22,919
I spawn a fire mob like in an area he
 

1093
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:26,710
I spawn a fire mob like in an area he
might not react to my my

1094
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:26,720

 

1095
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,510

coal and there we go yay yeah yeah yeah

1096
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:30,520
coal and there we go yay yeah yeah yeah
 

1097

coal and there we go yay yeah yeah yeah
that was

1098
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:32,520
that was
 

1099
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,230
that was
easy cuz it was still very much on fire

1100
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:35,240
easy cuz it was still very much on fire
 

1101
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,149
easy cuz it was still very much on fire
that was enough

1102
00:34:38,149 --> 00:34:38,159
that was enough
 

1103
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:47,470
that was enough
noise side quest complete what do I

1104
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:47,480

 

1105
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:51,710

get it was because of the

1106
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:51,720
get it was because of the
 

1107
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,430
get it was because of the
quest that makes sense because over here

1108
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:55,440
quest that makes sense because over here
 

1109
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:00,470
quest that makes sense because over here
it also is pinging

1110
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:00,480

 

1111
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,710

ah but I don't think I ever got a

1112
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:03,720
ah but I don't think I ever got a
 

1113
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:07,710
ah but I don't think I ever got a
crystal for a quest before so it's

1114
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:07,720
crystal for a quest before so it's
 

1115
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:10,150
crystal for a quest before so it's
like I think a lot of people might just

1116
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:10,160
like I think a lot of people might just
 

1117
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,510
like I think a lot of people might just
be looking around in the area for ages

1118
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:12,520
be looking around in the area for ages
 

1119
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,480

then I make myself a path I walk over I
place a torch that melts

4184
01:59:59,470 --> 01:59:59,480
place a torch that melts
 

4185
01:59:59,480 --> 02:00:01,870
place a torch that melts
everything

4186
02:00:01,870 --> 02:00:01,880
everything
 

4187
02:00:01,880 --> 02:00:04,270

around instead of waiting for that to
 

4189
02:00:04,280 --> 02:00:05,990

happen maybe I should just jump down try
 

4191
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:09,229

to grab the last one and because that

4192
02:00:09,229 --> 02:00:09,239
to grab the last one and because that
 

4193
02:00:09,239 --> 02:00:10,629
to grab the last one and because that
might cost a lot of time with me

4194
02:00:10,629 --> 02:00:10,639
might cost a lot of time with me
 

4195
02:00:10,639 --> 02:00:12,709

4235
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:21,589

02:11:32,310 --> 02:11:32,320
path I can jump up here to like wait a
 

4621
02:11:32,320 --> 02:11:34,390
path I can jump up here to like wait a
moment but

4622
02:11:34,390 --> 02:11:34,400
moment but
 

4623
02:11:34,400 --> 02:11:38,350
moment but
then but then should I jump down here

4624
02:11:38,350 --> 02:11:38,360
then but then should I jump down here
 

4625
02:11:38,360 --> 02:11:41,870
then but then should I jump down here
too with the ball like go completely

03:27:17,469 --> 03:27:17,479
here is because of the way way we are
 

7363
03:27:17,479 --> 03:27:20,790
here is because of the way way we are
entering wait then does he even have to

7364
03:27:20,790 --> 03:27:20,800
entering wait then does he even have to
 

7365
03:27:20,800 --> 03:27:22,990
entering wait then does he even have to
wait wait okay logical

7366
03:27:22,990 --> 03:27:23,000
wait wait okay logical
 

7367
03:27:23,000 --> 03:27:25,189
wait wait okay logical
hole

7368
03:27:25,189 --> 03:27:25,199
hole
 

7369
03:27:25,199 --> 03:27:28,229
hole
if if we're fine

7370
03:27:28,229 --> 03:27:28,239
if if we're fine
 

7371
03:27:28,239 --> 03:27:30,830
if if we're fine
anyway then couldn't we just jump into

7372
03:27:30,830 --> 03:27:30,840
anyway then couldn't we just jump into
 

7373
03:27:30,840 --> 03:27:32,990
anyway then couldn't we just jump into
the Rifts we don't need to jump through

7374
03:27:32,990 --> 03:27:33,000
the Rifts we don't need to jump through
 

7375
03:27:33,000 --> 03:27:35,429
the Rifts we don't need to jump through
a hole because everybody else who ends

7376
03:27:35,429 --> 03:27:35,439
a hole because everybody else who ends
 

7377
03:27:35,439 --> 03:27:38,030
a hole because everybody else who ends
up in these Rifts they're not all

7378
03:27:38,030 --> 03:27:38,040
up in these Rifts they're not all
 

7379
03:27:38,040 --> 03:27:39,550
up in these Rifts they're not all
entering through the hole either there

7380
03:27:39,550 --> 03:27:39,560
entering through the hole either there
 

7381
03:27:39,560 --> 03:27:42,189
entering through the hole either there
are no holes usually so they're just

7382
03:27:42,189 --> 03:27:42,199
are no holes usually so they're just
 

7383
03:27:42,199 --> 03:27:44,870
are no holes usually so they're just
like being rifted in and then they end

7384
03:27:44,870 --> 03:27:44,880
like being rifted in and then they end
 

7385
03:27:44,880 --> 03:27:46,910
like being rifted in and then they end
up like that but this guy also ended up

7386
03:27:46,910 --> 03:27:46,920
up like that but this guy also ended up
 

7387
03:27:46,920 --> 03:27:48,229
up like that but this guy also ended up
like that even though he went through

7388
03:27:48,229 --> 03:27:48,239
like that even though he went through
 

7389
03:27:48,239 --> 03:27:50,110
like that even though he went through
our

7390
03:27:50,110 --> 03:27:50,120
our
 

7391
03:27:50,120 --> 03:27:52,910
our
hole so you know what I'm saying it

7392
03:27:52,910 --> 03:27:52,920
hole so you know what I'm saying it
 

7393
03:27:52,920 --> 03:27:54,189
hole so you know what I'm saying it
doesn't really have anything to do with

7394
03:27:54,189 --> 03:27:54,199
doesn't really have anything to do with
 

7395
03:27:54,199 --> 03:27:57,389
doesn't really have anything to do with
the hole as they just told us so why do

7396
03:27:57,389 --> 03:27:57,399
the hole as they just told us so why do
 

7397
03:27:57,399 --> 03:28:00,429
the hole as they just told us so why do
we have to open holes in the first

7398
03:28:00,429 --> 03:28:00,439
we have to open holes in the first
 

7399
03:28:00,439 --> 03:28:03,349
we have to open holes in the first
place if the others can get in without

7400
03:28:03,349 --> 03:28:03,359
place if the others can get in without
 

7401
03:28:03,359 --> 03:28:05,309
place if the others can get in without
holes then we should also be able to get

7402
03:28:05,309 --> 03:28:05,319
holes then we should also be able to get
 

7403
03:28:05,319 --> 03:28:07,550
holes then we should also be able to get
in without holes and we should be fine

7404
03:28:07,550 --> 03:28:07,560
in without holes and we should be fine
 

7405
03:28:07,560 --> 03:28:11,910
in without holes and we should be fine
because lemonade John just said that me

7406
03:28:11,910 --> 03:28:11,920
because lemonade John just said that me
 

7407
03:28:11,920 --> 03:28:14,189
because lemonade John just said that me
and Link are

7408
03:28:14,189 --> 03:28:14,199
and Link are
 

7409
03:28:14,199 --> 03:28:16,910
and Link are
immune because it's not that we didn't

7410
03:28:16,910 --> 03:28:16,920
immune because it's not that we didn't
 

7411
03:28:16,920 --> 03:28:19,710
immune because it's not that we didn't
we can move around because of the hole

7412
03:28:19,710 --> 03:28:19,720
we can move around because of the hole
 

7413
03:28:19,720 --> 03:28:25,750
we can move around because of the hole
as she just said yeah you get it you get

7414
03:28:25,750 --> 03:28:25,760
as she just said yeah you get it you get
 

7415
03:28:25,760 --> 03:28:29,670
as she just said yeah you get it you get
it so the whole hole making thing is a

7416
03:28:29,670 --> 03:28:29,680
it so the whole hole making thing is a
 

7417
03:28:29,680 --> 03:28:35,590
it so the whole hole making thing is a
plot

7418
03:28:35,590 --> 03:28:35,600

 

7419
03:28:35,600 --> 03:28:38,309

hole Yeah link also got sucked in

7420
03:28:38,309 --> 03:28:38,319
hole Yeah link also got sucked in
 

7421
03:28:38,319 --> 03:28:41,429
hole Yeah link also got sucked in
without a proper entrance point and he's

7422
03:28:41,429 --> 03:28:41,439
without a proper entrance point and he's
 

7423
03:28:41,439 --> 03:28:43,950
without a proper entrance point and he's
able to move around so why do we always

7424
03:28:43,950 --> 03:28:43,960
able to move around so why do we always
 

7425
03:28:43,960 --> 03:28:47,750
able to move around so why do we always
have to find specific points to open a

7426
03:28:47,750 --> 03:28:47,760
have to find specific points to open a
 

7427
03:28:47,760 --> 03:28:50,710
have to find specific points to open a
hole makes no sense I think I don't

7428
03:28:50,710 --> 03:28:50,720
hole makes no sense I think I don't
 

7429
03:28:50,720 --> 03:28:52,630
hole makes no sense I think I don't
think they have an explanation for that

7430
03:28:52,630 --> 03:28:52,640
think they have an explanation for that
 

7431
03:28:52,640 --> 03:28:59,150
think they have an explanation for that
that's kind of a hole in their

7432
03:28:59,150 --> 03:28:59,160

 

7433
03:28:59,160 --> 03:29:03,150

logic to a a road to properly go in and

7434
03:29:03,150 --> 03:29:03,160
logic to a a road to properly go in and
 

7435
03:29:03,160 --> 03:29:07,030
logic to a a road to properly go in and
out no but like we go out by closing the

7436
03:29:07,030 --> 03:29:07,040
out no but like we go out by closing the
 

7437
03:29:07,040 --> 03:29:10,150
out no but like we go out by closing the
Rifts so I guess okay maybe at

7438
03:29:10,150 --> 03:29:10,160
Rifts so I guess okay maybe at
 

7439
03:29:10,160 --> 03:29:13,750
Rifts so I guess okay maybe at
least without a hole let's say we don't

7440
03:29:13,750 --> 03:29:13,760
least without a hole let's say we don't
 

7441
03:29:13,760 --> 03:29:16,550
least without a hole let's say we don't
find the lemons and we want to go out

7442
03:29:16,550 --> 03:29:16,560
find the lemons and we want to go out
 

7443
03:29:16,560 --> 03:29:18,750
find the lemons and we want to go out
though then we're [\h__\h] if we don't

7444
03:29:18,750 --> 03:29:18,760
though then we're [\h__\h] if we don't
 

7445
03:29:18,760 --> 03:29:21,510
though then we're [\h__\h] if we don't
have a hole

7446
03:29:21,510 --> 03:29:21,520
have a hole
 

7447
03:29:21,520 --> 03:29:24,790
have a hole
but if we were to go in without the hole

7448
03:29:24,790 --> 03:29:24,800
but if we were to go in without the hole
 

7449
03:29:24,800 --> 03:29:27,269
but if we were to go in without the hole
and then collect all lemons it would

7450
03:29:27,269 --> 03:29:27,279
and then collect all lemons it would
 

7451
03:29:27,279 --> 03:29:29,189
and then collect all lemons it would
close the rift and we would leave anyway

7452
03:29:29,189 --> 03:29:29,199
close the rift and we would leave anyway
 

7453
03:29:29,199 --> 03:29:31,429
close the rift and we would leave anyway
I

7454
03:29:31,429 --> 03:29:31,439

 

7455
03:29:31,439 --> 03:29:35,429

think so yeah just for easy entering and

7456
03:29:35,429 --> 03:29:35,439
think so yeah just for easy entering and
 

7457
03:29:35,439 --> 03:29:38,590
think so yeah just for easy entering and
exiting I guess but I don't really think

7458
03:29:38,590 --> 03:29:38,600
exiting I guess but I don't really think
 

7459
03:29:38,600 --> 03:29:44,590
exiting I guess but I don't really think
that dat thought of this part in their

7460
03:29:44,590 --> 03:29:44,600

 

7461
03:29:44,600 --> 03:29:47,750

logic yeah yeah yeah whatever I should

7462
03:29:47,750 --> 03:29:47,760
logic yeah yeah yeah whatever I should
 

7463
03:29:47,760 --> 03:29:51,110
logic yeah yeah yeah whatever I should
not waste my time too much on these

7464
03:29:51,110 --> 03:29:51,120
not waste my time too much on these
 

7465
03:29:51,120 --> 03:29:56,429
not waste my time too much on these
Logistics

7466
03:29:56,429 --> 03:29:56,439

 

7467
03:29:56,439 --> 03:30:02,030

right uh so I can walk over it slowly

7468
03:30:02,030 --> 03:30:02,040

 

7469
03:30:02,040 --> 03:30:04,630

this I don't get to learn how to create

7470
03:30:04,630 --> 03:30:04,640
this I don't get to learn how to create
 

7471
03:30:04,640 --> 03:30:12,910
this I don't get to learn how to create
one of these though

7472
03:30:12,910 --> 03:30:12,920

 

7473
03:30:12,920 --> 03:30:16,349

will say I

7530
03:32:13,429 --> 03:32:13,439
will say I
 

7531
03:32:13,439 --> 03:32:18,070
will say I
suppose falling for a hole

7532
03:32:18,070 --> 03:32:18,080

 

7533
03:32:18,080 --> 03:32:20,110

will disappear after a while but I walk

7554
03:32:55,189 --> 03:32:55,199
will disappear after a while but I walk
 

7555
03:32:55,199 --> 03:32:56,950

or is it not even necessary I I would
 

7641
03:35:52,319 --> 03:35:54,349
or is it not even necessary I I would
think it's necessary to stop the flow

7642
03:35:54,349 --> 03:35:54,359
think it's necessary to stop the flow
 

7643
03:35:54,359 --> 03:35:56,590

spoilered somewhere along the lines but
 

17991
08:52:11,200 --> 08:52:12,350
