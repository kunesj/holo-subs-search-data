you may not like uh

700
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:03,860

707
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,470
so if you if you don't have one yet then
you should get the updated version

um so I was like you know the chances of

1548
00:41:36,829 --> 00:41:36,839
um so I was like you know the chances of
 

1549
00:41:36,839 --> 00:41:39,490
um so I was like you know the chances of
me when I just go to the air airport

1550
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:39,500
me when I just go to the air airport
 

1551
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,230
me when I just go to the air airport

1552
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:42,240
without having chosen a seat yet without
 

1553
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,270
without having chosen a seat yet without
checking in online yet the chances of

1554
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:44,280
checking in online yet the chances of
 

1555
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,910
checking in online yet the chances of
them giving me one of those Solo Seats

1556
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:46,920
them giving me one of those Solo Seats
 

1557
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,950
them giving me one of those Solo Seats
instead of the double seat that I have

1558
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:48,960
instead of the double seat that I have
 

1559
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,770
instead of the double seat that I have
to sit next to a stranger then I'm

1560
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:51,780
to sit next to a stranger then I'm
 

1561
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:55,670
to sit next to a stranger then I'm
pretty high at that rate because like

1562
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:55,680
pretty high at that rate because like
 

1563
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,310
pretty high at that rate because like
like they were like one two three four

1564
00:41:58,310 --> 00:41:58,320
like they were like one two three four
 

1565
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,410

00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:01,870
five I think there were five solo seats
left

1568
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:01,880

1569
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:06,109
left
four of them Thrones and one not quite a

1570
00:42:06,109 --> 00:42:06,119
four of them Thrones and one not quite a
 

1571
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:08,329
four of them Thrones and one not quite a
throne but like half of a throne

1572
00:42:08,329 --> 00:42:08,339
throne but like half of a throne
 

1573
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:11,150

this is not a real problem
 

3177
01:18:50,699 --> 01:18:54,050
this is not a real problem
to not have this choice that you wanted

01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:58,430
anymore like deal with it but the fact
that it's in the class where you pay

3182
01:18:58,430 --> 01:18:58,440
that it's in the class where you pay
 

3183
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:01,070
that it's in the class where you pay
thousands and thousands of bucks

01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:01,080
thousands and thousands of bucks
 

3185
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:04,729
thousands and thousands of bucks
you would maybe expect to get what's

3186
01:19:04,729 --> 01:19:04,739
you would maybe expect to get what's
 

3187
01:19:04,739 --> 01:19:07,490
you would maybe expect to get what's
offered on the menu they could at least

3188
01:19:07,490 --> 01:19:07,500
offered on the menu they could at least
 

3189
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:10,310
offered on the menu they could at least
like as I said like they asked with the

3190
01:19:10,310 --> 01:19:10,320
like as I said like they asked with the
 

3191
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:13,010
like as I said like they asked with the
main course the first lunch

3192
01:19:13,010 --> 01:19:13,020
main course the first lunch
 

3193
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:15,110
main course the first lunch
they could ask you about the breakfast

3194
01:19:15,110 --> 01:19:15,120
they could ask you about the breakfast
 

3195
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:17,030
they could ask you about the breakfast

too what you want
 

3197

too what you want
and then sort it out beforehand not when

3198
01:19:20,510 --> 01:19:20,520
and then sort it out beforehand not when
 

3199
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:22,250
and then sort it out beforehand not when
it happens because like this always

3200
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:22,260
it happens because like this always
 

3201
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:24,290
it happens because like this always
happens when you're in the and let me

3202
01:19:24,290 --> 01:19:24,300
happens when you're in the and let me
 

3203
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:26,030
happens when you're in the and let me
tell you if you're flying if you don't

3205
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:28,850
tell you if you're flying if you don't

3206
01:19:28,850 --> 01:19:28,860
normally fly I would recommend you to
 

3207
01:19:28,860 --> 01:19:32,330
normally fly I would recommend you to
not choose a a seat in the very back of

3208
01:19:32,330 --> 01:19:32,340
not choose a a seat in the very back of
 

3209
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:34,610
not choose a a seat in the very back of
the plane because especially in the

3210
01:19:34,610 --> 01:19:34,620
the plane because especially in the
 

3211
01:19:34,620 --> 01:19:37,729
the plane because especially in the
economy it happens so often that there

3212
01:19:37,729 --> 01:19:37,739
economy it happens so often that there
 

3213
01:19:37,739 --> 01:19:40,370
economy it happens so often that there
is one popular choice and one unpopular

3214
01:19:40,370 --> 01:19:40,380
is one popular choice and one unpopular
 

3215
01:19:40,380 --> 01:19:42,290
is one popular choice and one unpopular
choice and if you sit in the back at the

3216
01:19:42,290 --> 01:19:42,300
choice and if you sit in the back at the
 

3217
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:44,270
choice and if you sit in the back at the
end the popular choice will not be left

3218
01:19:44,270 --> 01:19:44,280
end the popular choice will not be left
 

3219
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:46,729
end the popular choice will not be left
over you will have to take what you can

get
this happens all the time so

01:19:52,790 --> 01:19:52,800
this happens all the time so
 

3225
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,350
this happens all the time so
I didn't think it would happen with

01:19:54,350 --> 01:19:54,360
I didn't think it would happen with

01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:56,630
I didn't think it would happen with
business but it happened

3243
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:15,830

you don't get off it on food on your

3244
01:20:15,830 --> 01:20:15,840
you don't get off it on food on your
 

3245
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:16,970
you don't get off it on food on your
plants yeah that's because you only do

3246
01:20:16,970 --> 01:20:16,980
plants yeah that's because you only do
 

3247
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:20,750
plants yeah that's because you only do
short shorts distance flights then yeah

3248
01:20:20,750 --> 01:20:20,760
short shorts distance flights then yeah
 

3249
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:22,790
short shorts distance flights then yeah
I wonder if they started from the back

3250
01:20:22,790 --> 01:20:22,800
I wonder if they started from the back
 

3251
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:25,250
I wonder if they started from the back
no they started from the front they

3252
01:20:25,250 --> 01:20:25,260
no they started from the front they
 

3253
01:20:25,260 --> 01:20:28,850
no they started from the front they
always do

3254
01:20:28,850 --> 01:20:28,860

 

3255
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:30,470

yeah no normally they always start from

3256
01:20:30,470 --> 01:20:30,480
yeah no normally they always start from
 

3257
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:32,030
yeah no normally they always start from
the front

3258
01:20:32,030 --> 01:20:32,040
the front
 

3259
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:34,750
the front
yeah

3260
01:20:34,750 --> 01:20:34,760
yeah
 

3261
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:37,790
yeah
easier access to stretch areas

3262
01:20:37,790 --> 01:20:37,800
easier access to stretch areas
 

3263
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:39,590
easier access to stretch areas
yeah yeah there's other reasons why you

3264
01:20:39,590 --> 01:20:39,600
yeah yeah there's other reasons why you
 

3265
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:40,970
yeah yeah there's other reasons why you
would want to be in the back of the

3266
01:20:40,970 --> 01:20:40,980
would want to be in the back of the
 

3267
01:20:40,980 --> 01:20:43,930
would want to be in the back of the
plane but generally if you don't wanna

3268
01:20:43,930 --> 01:20:43,940
plane but generally if you don't wanna
 

3269
01:20:43,940 --> 01:20:46,430
plane but generally if you don't wanna
like have this happen to you then don't

3270
01:20:46,430 --> 01:20:46,440
like have this happen to you then don't
 

3271
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:49,310
like have this happen to you then don't
be in the front of the plane

3272
01:20:49,310 --> 01:20:49,320
be in the front of the plane
 

3273
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:53,689
be in the front of the plane
yeah so my conclusion it's not about the

3274
01:20:53,689 --> 01:20:53,699
yeah so my conclusion it's not about the
 

3275
01:20:53,699 --> 01:20:56,770
yeah so my conclusion it's not about the
food is not influencing this at all

3276
01:20:56,770 --> 01:20:56,780
food is not influencing this at all
 

3277
01:20:56,780 --> 01:21:01,130
food is not influencing this at all
the flight was super comfortable really

3278
01:21:01,130 --> 01:21:01,140
the flight was super comfortable really
 

3279
01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:03,169
the flight was super comfortable really
but I still don't think it's worth the

3280
01:21:03,169 --> 01:21:03,179
but I still don't think it's worth the
 

3281
01:21:03,179 --> 01:21:04,970
but I still don't think it's worth the
money

3282
01:21:04,970 --> 01:21:04,980
money
 

3283
01:21:04,980 --> 01:21:07,490
money
if you get upgraded for free because of

3284
01:21:07,490 --> 01:21:07,500
if you get upgraded for free because of
 

3285
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:09,050
if you get upgraded for free because of
your status because you have so many

3286
01:21:09,050 --> 01:21:09,060
your status because you have so many
 

3287
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:11,209
your status because you have so many
miles or if you use your mouse instead

3288
01:21:11,209 --> 01:21:11,219
miles or if you use your mouse instead
 

3289
01:21:11,219 --> 01:21:14,330
miles or if you use your mouse instead
of real money then it's worth it

3290
01:21:14,330 --> 01:21:14,340
of real money then it's worth it
 

3291
01:21:14,340 --> 01:21:16,250
of real money then it's worth it
basically if you're not spending real

3292
01:21:16,250 --> 01:21:16,260
basically if you're not spending real
 

3293
01:21:16,260 --> 01:21:17,510
basically if you're not spending real
money

3294
01:21:17,510 --> 01:21:17,520
money
 

3295
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:21,169
money
then it's worth it the little upgrades

3296
01:21:21,169 --> 01:21:21,179
then it's worth it the little upgrades
 

3297
01:21:21,179 --> 01:21:25,250
then it's worth it the little upgrades
it it was fine like paying 800 extra on

3298
01:21:25,250 --> 01:21:25,260
it it was fine like paying 800 extra on
 

3299
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:27,470
it it was fine like paying 800 extra on
top of the normal ticket it was fine

3300
01:21:27,470 --> 01:21:27,480
top of the normal ticket it was fine
 

3301
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:29,930
top of the normal ticket it was fine
doing it like once but I don't want to

example in uh in January February I flew

example in uh in January February I flew
 

3391
01:23:55,260 --> 01:23:57,290
example in uh in January February I flew
with a different Airline than I flew

3392
01:23:57,290 --> 01:23:57,300

so I always always had to take a

3404
01:24:16,070 --> 01:24:16,080
so I always always had to take a
 

3405
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:18,050
so I always always had to take a
connection and there was always a

3406
01:24:18,050 --> 01:24:18,060

3407
01:24:18,060 --> 01:24:19,790

01:24:19,790 --> 01:24:19,800

and so I could never really collect the

3414
01:24:27,890 --> 01:24:27,900
and so I could never really collect the
 

3415
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:29,930
and so I could never really collect the
miles because some of them are connected

3416
01:24:29,930 --> 01:24:29,940
miles because some of them are connected
 

3417
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:32,149

um
 

3433
01:24:49,260 --> 01:24:50,810
um
I think I did especially because like

3434
01:24:50,810 --> 01:24:50,820
I think I did especially because like
 

3435
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:52,610
I think I did especially because like
for this flight I paid so I should be

3436
01:24:52,610 --> 01:24:52,620
for this flight I paid so I should be
 

3437
01:24:52,620 --> 01:24:54,770
for this flight I paid so I should be
getting a lot of miles for it right

3438
01:24:54,770 --> 01:24:54,780
getting a lot of miles for it right
 

3439
01:24:54,780 --> 01:24:56,570
getting a lot of miles for it right
I think so

3440
01:24:56,570 --> 01:24:56,580

3441
01:24:56,580 --> 01:24:58,669
I think so
um because it's an expensive expensive

3442
01:24:58,669 --> 01:24:58,679
um because it's an expensive expensive
 

3443
01:24:58,679 --> 01:25:00,530

02:03:35,940 --> 02:03:37,129
privately more or less while Germany and
some other countries there's like two

5125
02:03:39,179 --> 02:03:41,330
different ways I do it you know they do
all open auditions and then I think

5126
02:03:41,330 --> 02:03:41,340
all open auditions and then I think
 

5127
02:03:41,340 --> 02:03:44,390
all open auditions and then I think
there's like a like a elimination round

5128
02:03:44,390 --> 02:03:44,400
there's like a like a elimination round
 

5129
02:03:44,400 --> 02:03:46,609
there's like a like a elimination round
like they get like I don't know 10

5130
02:03:46,609 --> 02:03:46,619
like they get like I don't know 10
 

5131
02:03:46,619 --> 02:03:50,330
like they get like I don't know 10

5133
02:03:50,340 --> 02:03:52,490
people or so 10 artists and then I don't
I I'm not sure how the system is if like

5134
02:03:52,490 --> 02:03:52,500
I I'm not sure how the system is if like
 

5135
02:03:52,500 --> 02:03:55,850
I I'm not sure how the system is if like
uh the audience votes who will be the

5136
02:03:55,850 --> 02:03:55,860
uh the audience votes who will be the
 

5137
02:03:55,860 --> 02:03:58,129
uh the audience votes who will be the
German contestant or if it's like a

5138
02:03:58,129 --> 02:03:58,139
German contestant or if it's like a
 

5139
02:03:58,139 --> 02:04:00,589
German contestant or if it's like a
judge a jury

5140
02:04:00,589 --> 02:04:00,599
judge a jury
 

5141
02:04:00,599 --> 02:04:02,089
judge a jury
there's probably information about that

5142
02:04:02,089 --> 02:04:02,099
there's probably information about that
 

5143
02:04:02,099 --> 02:04:05,030
there's probably information about that
out there and I I'm not sure right now

5144
02:04:05,030 --> 02:04:05,040
out there and I I'm not sure right now
 

5145
02:04:05,040 --> 02:04:07,850
out there and I I'm not sure right now
um if it's an audience vote then we have

5146
02:04:07,850 --> 02:04:07,860
um if it's an audience vote then we have
 

5147
02:04:07,860 --> 02:04:10,729
um if it's an audience vote then we have
a chance but I first have to get chosen

5148
02:04:10,729 --> 02:04:10,739
a chance but I first have to get chosen
 

5149
02:04:10,739 --> 02:04:14,390
a chance but I first have to get chosen
to be one of the choices in the first

5150
02:04:14,390 --> 02:04:14,400
to be one of the choices in the first
 

5151
02:04:14,400 --> 02:04:18,169
to be one of the choices in the first
place so that's what I'm gonna do after

5152
02:04:18,169 --> 02:04:18,179
place so that's what I'm gonna do after
 

5153
02:04:18,179 --> 02:04:22,250
place so that's what I'm gonna do after
the stream and

5154
02:04:22,250 --> 02:04:22,260

 

5155
02:04:22,260 --> 02:04:25,430

I think

5156
02:04:25,430 --> 02:04:25,440

 

5157
02:04:25,440 --> 02:04:28,490

um it's about making headlines you want

5164
02:04:34,609 --> 02:04:34,619
um it's about making headlines you want
 

5165
02:04:34,619 --> 02:04:38,450

your country to stand out and even if
 

5167
02:04:38,460 --> 02:04:41,570
your country to stand out and even if
maybe for me it's not so much about

5168
02:04:41,570 --> 02:04:41,580
maybe for me it's not so much about
 

5169
02:04:41,580 --> 02:04:43,669
maybe for me it's not so much about
winning at all it's just about being

5170
02:04:43,669 --> 02:04:43,679
winning at all it's just about being
 

5171
02:04:43,679 --> 02:04:46,370
winning at all it's just about being
there and for the country it would be a

5172
02:04:46,370 --> 02:04:46,380
there and for the country it would be a
 

5173
02:04:46,380 --> 02:04:48,169
there and for the country it would be a
huge headline to have a YouTuber there

5174
02:04:48,169 --> 02:04:48,179
huge headline to have a YouTuber there
 

5175
02:04:48,179 --> 02:04:49,430
huge headline to have a YouTuber there
you know that's just what I'm thinking

5176
02:04:49,430 --> 02:04:49,440
you know that's just what I'm thinking
 

5177
02:04:49,440 --> 02:04:51,770
you know that's just what I'm thinking
like if you want your country to be the

5178
02:04:51,770 --> 02:04:51,780
like if you want your country to be the
 

5179
02:04:51,780 --> 02:04:54,709
like if you want your country to be the
number one topic of the Eurovision song

5180
02:04:54,709 --> 02:04:54,719
number one topic of the Eurovision song
 

5181
02:04:54,719 --> 02:04:58,370
number one topic of the Eurovision song
contest than having a YouTuber on stage

contest than having a YouTuber on stage
 

5183
02:04:58,380 --> 02:05:02,709
contest than having a YouTuber on stage
will definitely make that happen

5184
02:05:02,709 --> 02:05:02,719
will definitely make that happen
 

5185
02:05:02,719 --> 02:05:05,750
will definitely make that happen
everybody will talk about it some people

5186
02:05:05,750 --> 02:05:05,760
everybody will talk about it some people
 

5187
02:05:05,760 --> 02:05:08,450
everybody will talk about it some people
surely will make fun of it but it will

5188
02:05:08,450 --> 02:05:08,460
surely will make fun of it but it will
 

5189

02:05:27,530 --> 02:05:27,540
honestly really low I don't think they
 

5203
02:05:27,540 --> 02:05:29,089
honestly really low I don't think they
will go for it because I feel like

5204
02:05:29,089 --> 02:05:29,099
will go for it because I feel like
 

5205
02:05:29,099 --> 02:05:30,830
will go for it because I feel like
Austria might have gone for it because

5206
02:05:30,830 --> 02:05:30,840
Austria might have gone for it because
 

5207
02:05:30,840 --> 02:05:32,810
Austria might have gone for it because
they do crazy [\h__\h]

5210
02:05:35,209 --> 02:05:35,219

a contestant a few years ago who was

02:05:38,030 --> 02:05:38,040
a contestant a few years ago who was
 

5213
02:05:38,040 --> 02:05:40,910

Harajuku fashion I think

5216
02:05:42,890 --> 02:05:42,900
Harajuku fashion I think
 

5217
02:05:42,900 --> 02:05:44,689
Harajuku fashion I think
but I think she sang a pretty normal

5218
02:05:44,689 --> 02:05:44,699
but I think she sang a pretty normal
 

5219
02:05:44,699 --> 02:05:46,010
but I think she sang a pretty normal
song

5220
02:05:46,010 --> 02:05:46,020
song
 

5221
02:05:46,020 --> 02:05:49,010
song
but her visuals were like a weeb

5222
02:05:49,010 --> 02:05:49,020
but her visuals were like a weeb
 

5223
02:05:49,020 --> 02:05:51,290
but her visuals were like a weeb
but that's maybe the craziest thing that

5224
02:05:51,290 --> 02:05:51,300
but that's maybe the craziest thing that
 

5225
02:05:51,300 --> 02:05:53,160
but that's maybe the craziest thing that

um yeah okay I I don't think this is a
necessary thing generally but there's

6174
02:29:04,309 --> 02:29:04,319
necessary thing generally but there's
 

6175
02:29:04,319 --> 02:29:06,910
necessary thing generally but there's
one usage that I would say makes sense

6176
02:29:06,910 --> 02:29:06,920
one usage that I would say makes sense
 

6177
02:29:06,920 --> 02:29:11,990
one usage that I would say makes sense
in some way uh this is for cats

um you put the cat in there and I was

6188
02:29:25,670 --> 02:29:25,680

my cats are fine with entering I'm

6192
02:29:30,170 --> 02:29:30,180
my cats are fine with entering I'm
 

6193
02:29:30,180 --> 02:29:32,389
my cats are fine with entering I'm
surprised because I would feel like they

6194
02:29:32,389 --> 02:29:32,399
surprised because I would feel like they
 

6195
02:29:32,399 --> 02:29:35,150
surprised because I would feel like they
wouldn't want to be in there

6196
02:29:35,150 --> 02:29:35,160
wouldn't want to be in there
 

6197
02:29:35,160 --> 02:29:37,309
wouldn't want to be in there
um

6198
02:29:37,309 --> 02:29:37,319

 

6199
02:29:37,319 --> 02:29:39,170

um but we tested it out on one of her

6200
02:29:39,170 --> 02:29:39,180
um but we tested it out on one of her
 

6201
02:29:39,180 --> 02:29:41,450
um but we tested it out on one of her
cats because I wanted to see it and the

6202
02:29:41,450 --> 02:29:41,460
cats because I wanted to see it and the
 

6203
02:29:41,460 --> 02:29:44,630
cats because I wanted to see it and the
the one cat that I took a picture of it

6204
02:29:44,630 --> 02:29:44,640
the one cat that I took a picture of it
 

6205
02:29:44,640 --> 02:29:47,630
the one cat that I took a picture of it
went inside and then you turn it on and

6206
02:29:47,630 --> 02:29:47,640
went inside and then you turn it on and
 

6207
02:29:47,640 --> 02:29:51,530
went inside and then you turn it on and
then error error starts like

6208
02:29:51,530 --> 02:29:51,540
then error error starts like
 

6209
02:29:51,540 --> 02:29:53,630
then error error starts like
blowing at the cat

6210
02:29:53,630 --> 02:29:53,640
blowing at the cat
 

6211
02:29:53,640 --> 02:29:55,809
blowing at the cat
from several openings

6212
02:29:55,809 --> 02:29:55,819
from several openings
 

6213
02:29:55,819 --> 02:29:58,429
from several openings
and the cat was just chilling there the

6214
02:29:58,429 --> 02:29:58,439
and the cat was just chilling there the
 

6215
02:29:58,439 --> 02:30:02,050
and the cat was just chilling there the
cat was like cleaning itself

6216
02:30:02,050 --> 02:30:02,060

 

6217
02:30:02,060 --> 02:30:04,969

but I didn't see any hair really flying

6218
02:30:04,969 --> 02:30:04,979
but I didn't see any hair really flying
 

6219
02:30:04,979 --> 02:30:06,830
but I didn't see any hair really flying
around so I don't think it really works

6220
02:30:06,830 --> 02:30:06,840
around so I don't think it really works
 

6221
02:30:06,840 --> 02:30:09,290
around so I don't think it really works
well because once the cat went out and I

6222
02:30:09,290 --> 02:30:09,300
well because once the cat went out and I
 

6223
02:30:09,300 --> 02:30:11,870
well because once the cat went out and I
pet the cat again again I had a [\h__\h] ton

6224
02:30:11,870 --> 02:30:11,880
pet the cat again again I had a [\h__\h] ton
 

6225
02:30:11,880 --> 02:30:14,210
pet the cat again again I had a [\h__\h] ton
of hair on my hand this one was losing

6226
02:30:14,210 --> 02:30:14,220
of hair on my hand this one was losing
 

6227
02:30:14,220 --> 02:30:18,050
of hair on my hand this one was losing
so much hair

6228
02:30:18,050 --> 02:30:18,060

 

6229
02:30:18,060 --> 02:30:21,650

but the other usage that makes sense I

6230
02:30:21,650 --> 02:30:21,660
but the other usage that makes sense I
 

6231
02:30:21,660 --> 02:30:23,570
but the other usage that makes sense I
would say maybe also for small dogs

6232
02:30:23,570 --> 02:30:23,580
would say maybe also for small dogs
 

6233
02:30:23,580 --> 02:30:26,090
would say maybe also for small dogs
mostly

6234
02:30:26,090 --> 02:30:26,100
mostly
 

6235
02:30:26,100 --> 02:30:27,170
mostly
um because I don't think you really

6236
02:30:27,170 --> 02:30:27,180
um because I don't think you really
 

6237
02:30:27,180 --> 02:30:29,450
um because I don't think you really
watched you you shouldn't you don't need

6238
02:30:29,450 --> 02:30:29,460

is that if you washed your cat you can

6258

is that if you washed your cat you can
 

6259

is that if you washed your cat you can
put it in this room and it gets dried
