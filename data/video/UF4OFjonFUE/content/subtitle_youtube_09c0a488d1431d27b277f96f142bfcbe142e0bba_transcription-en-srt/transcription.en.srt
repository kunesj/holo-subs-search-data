again the second one uh it's a c
 

537
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,670
again the second one uh it's a c
and then it goes into a little loop oh

538
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:51,680
and then it goes into a little loop oh
 

539
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,310
and then it goes into a little loop oh
yeah okay

540
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:52,320

line through it
 

557
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,430
line through it
i think it's a pi symbol what's the pi

558
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:11,440
i think it's a pi symbol what's the pi
 

559
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,069
i think it's a pi symbol what's the pi
is that oh

560
00:16:12,069 --> 00:16:12,079
is that oh
 

561
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,430
is that oh
wait what does supply symbol look like

562
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:15,440
wait what does supply symbol look like
 

563
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,150
wait what does supply symbol look like
um but i guess it's this one from you

564
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:18,160
um but i guess it's this one from you
 

565
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,310
um but i guess it's this one from you
said there's a line going through it

566
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:20,320
said there's a line going through it
 

567
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,389
said there's a line going through it
yeah yeah that's probably what's the

568
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:22,399
yeah yeah that's probably what's the
 

569
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,670
yeah yeah that's probably what's the
fourth one

570
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:23,680
fourth one
 

571
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,910
fourth one
uh it's the x with the i in the middle

572
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:25,920
uh it's the x with the i in the middle
 

573
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,910
uh it's the x with the i in the middle
okay i think it's this column yeah

574
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:27,920
okay i think it's this column yeah
 

575
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,110
okay i think it's this column yeah
okay then you start with the c that

576
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:31,120
okay then you start with the c that
 

577
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,550
okay then you start with the c that
like continues to scribble

578
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:34,560
like continues to scribble
 

579
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,110
like continues to scribble
and then you go with the x with the i in

580
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:37,120
and then you go with the x with the i in
 

581
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,230
and then you go with the x with the i in
the middle

582
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:38,240
the middle
 

583
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,269
the middle
okay then the three where you

00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:41,279
okay then the three where you
 

585
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,389
okay then the three where you
couldn't write anymore i got it okay

586
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:44,399
couldn't write anymore i got it okay
 

587
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,269
couldn't write anymore i got it okay
nice next there's one more thing here
