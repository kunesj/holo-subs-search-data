03:47:11,510 --> 03:47:11,520
but
 

8755
03:47:11,520 --> 03:47:15,229
but
uh a lot of times just disappears

8756
03:47:15,229 --> 03:47:15,239
uh a lot of times just disappears
 

8757
03:47:15,239 --> 03:47:17,330
uh a lot of times just disappears
for example with the hedges as well I

8758
03:47:17,330 --> 03:47:17,340
for example with the hedges as well I
 

8759
03:47:17,340 --> 03:47:19,910
for example with the hedges as well I
couldn't find U-Haul anymore so

8760
03:47:19,910 --> 03:47:19,920
couldn't find U-Haul anymore so
 

8761
03:47:19,920 --> 03:47:22,910
couldn't find U-Haul anymore so
it's like every time I need is not

8762
03:47:22,910 --> 03:47:22,920
it's like every time I need is not
 

8763
03:47:22,920 --> 03:47:26,990
it's like every time I need is not
available

8764
03:47:26,990 --> 03:47:27,000

 

8765
03:47:27,000 --> 03:47:29,570

yeah I understand that it might be too

8766
03:47:29,570 --> 03:47:29,580
yeah I understand that it might be too
 

8767
03:47:29,580 --> 03:47:30,769
yeah I understand that it might be too
op

8768
03:47:30,769 --> 03:47:30,779
op
 

8769
03:47:30,779 --> 03:47:31,610

8773
03:47:36,060 --> 03:47:38,929

yeah it makes it makes sense because

8774
03:47:38,929 --> 03:47:38,939
yeah it makes it makes sense because
 

8775
03:47:38,939 --> 03:47:42,530
yeah it makes it makes sense because
it's just a a thing that can fly and

8776
03:47:42,530 --> 03:47:42,540
it's just a a thing that can fly and
 

8777
03:47:42,540 --> 03:47:44,809
it's just a a thing that can fly and
like it's an animal that I can easily

8778
03:47:44,809 --> 03:47:44,819
like it's an animal that I can easily
 

8779
03:47:44,819 --> 03:47:47,990
like it's an animal that I can easily
communicate to with my animal Ken

8780
03:47:47,990 --> 03:47:48,000
communicate to with my animal Ken
 

8781
03:47:48,000 --> 03:47:50,809
communicate to with my animal Ken
it's it's too op I guess yeah but now

8782
03:47:50,809 --> 03:47:50,819
it's it's too op I guess yeah but now
 

8783
