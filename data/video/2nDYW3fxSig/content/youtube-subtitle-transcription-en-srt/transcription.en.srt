because because i took it quite
 

5283
03:10:02,000 --> 03:10:03,030
because because i took it quite
seriously

5284
03:10:03,030 --> 03:10:03,040
seriously
 

5285
03:10:03,040 --> 03:10:05,910
seriously
i felt like i couldn't do much better

5286
03:10:05,910 --> 03:10:05,920
i felt like i couldn't do much better
 

5287
03:10:05,920 --> 03:10:07,349
i felt like i couldn't do much better
um

5288
03:10:07,349 --> 03:10:07,359
um
 

5289
03:10:07,359 --> 03:10:09,190
um
yeah it's kind of sad that we still

5290
03:10:09,190 --> 03:10:09,200
yeah it's kind of sad that we still
 

5291
03:10:09,200 --> 03:10:11,670
yeah it's kind of sad that we still
didn't really figure out the

5292
03:10:11,670 --> 03:10:11,680
didn't really figure out the
 

5293
03:10:11,680 --> 03:10:12,710
didn't really figure out the
the

5294
03:10:12,710 --> 03:10:12,720
the
 

5295
03:10:12,720 --> 03:10:15,110
the
um sync thing even though we tested it

5296
03:10:15,110 --> 03:10:15,120
um sync thing even though we tested it
 

5297
03:10:15,120 --> 03:10:17,510
um sync thing even though we tested it
out but i guess

5298
03:10:17,510 --> 03:10:17,520
out but i guess
 

5299
03:10:17,520 --> 03:10:20,229
out but i guess
yeah we we kind of

5300
03:10:20,229 --> 03:10:20,239
yeah we we kind of
 

5301
03:10:20,239 --> 03:10:22,150
yeah we we kind of
you know forgot to do it before the

5302
03:10:22,150 --> 03:10:22,160
you know forgot to do it before the
 

5303
03:10:22,160 --> 03:10:24,070
you know forgot to do it before the
stream properly but i think even if we

5304
03:10:24,070 --> 03:10:24,080
stream properly but i think even if we
 

5305
03:10:24,080 --> 03:10:25,910
stream properly but i think even if we
did it before the stream we still would

5306
03:10:25,910 --> 03:10:25,920
did it before the stream we still would
 

5307
03:10:25,920 --> 03:10:28,150
did it before the stream we still would
have had issues during this stream

5308
03:10:28,150 --> 03:10:28,160
have had issues during this stream
 

5309
03:10:28,160 --> 03:10:30,070
have had issues during this stream
because like even if we sync up the

5310
03:10:30,070 --> 03:10:30,080
because like even if we sync up the
 

5311
03:10:30,080 --> 03:10:32,630
because like even if we sync up the
audio then i guess my moves are not

5312
03:10:32,630 --> 03:10:32,640
audio then i guess my moves are not
 

5313
03:10:32,640 --> 03:10:34,070
audio then i guess my moves are not
synced for them or something like that i

5314
03:10:34,070 --> 03:10:34,080
synced for them or something like that i
 

5315
03:10:34,080 --> 03:10:35,269
synced for them or something like that i
don't know

5316
03:10:35,269 --> 03:10:35,279
don't know
 

5317
03:10:35,279 --> 03:10:37,990
don't know
uh i mean we need to think of a a

5318
03:10:37,990 --> 03:10:38,000
uh i mean we need to think of a a
 

5319
03:10:38,000 --> 03:10:40,710

8365
05:14:39,600 --> 05:14:42,070
and uh they were maybe
difficult to join into although you

8366
05:14:42,070 --> 05:14:42,080
difficult to join into although you
 

8367
05:14:42,080 --> 05:14:43,270
difficult to join into although you
should have just given it a chance

8368
05:14:43,270 --> 05:14:43,280
should have just given it a chance
 

8369
05:14:43,280 --> 05:14:45,510
should have just given it a chance
anyway but still anyway so for those

8370
05:14:45,510 --> 05:14:45,520
anyway but still anyway so for those
 

8371
05:14:45,520 --> 05:14:48,310
anyway but still anyway so for those
people i feel like

8372
05:14:48,310 --> 05:14:48,320
people i feel like
 

8373
05:14:48,320 --> 05:14:52,150
people i feel like
i want them to give those streams a try

8374
05:14:52,150 --> 05:14:52,160
i want them to give those streams a try
 

8375
05:14:52,160 --> 05:14:54,070
i want them to give those streams a try
the the ones

8376
05:14:54,070 --> 05:14:54,080
the the ones
 

8377
05:14:54,080 --> 05:14:56,390
the the ones
with the hand cam for example or the

8378
05:14:56,390 --> 05:14:56,400
with the hand cam for example or the
 

8379
05:14:56,400 --> 05:14:58,550
with the hand cam for example or the
dancing streams and all that

8380
05:14:58,550 --> 05:14:58,560
dancing streams and all that
 

8381
05:14:58,560 --> 05:14:59,910
dancing streams and all that
so

8382
05:14:59,910 --> 05:14:59,920
so
 

8383
05:14:59,920 --> 05:15:02,070
so
since those are short relatively short

8384
05:15:02,070 --> 05:15:02,080
since those are short relatively short
 

8385
05:15:02,080 --> 05:15:04,390
since those are short relatively short
and you don't need to know any

8386
05:15:04,390 --> 05:15:04,400

8393
05:15:11,840 --> 05:15:12,948

so

8394
05:15:12,948 --> 05:15:12,958
so
 

8395
05:15:12,958 --> 05:15:14,070
