1935
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:07,349
and well at home so i guess i can't
really judge

1936

that
 

1943
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,190
that
there should be this hand sanitizers in

like in the in the entrance but like if
i judge

1948
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:18,640
i judge
 

1949
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:21,910

just by the airport then i can say that

1950
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:21,920
just by the airport then i can say that
 

1951
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:25,990
just by the airport then i can say that
um yeah japanese airport had way more

1952

um yeah japanese airport had way more
 

1953
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,069
um yeah japanese airport had way more
hand sanitizers so i think it will be

and i don't think it's really necessary
because they they

3448
01:19:26,950 --> 01:19:26,960
because they they
 

3449
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:28,790
because they they
use their scratching poles and that

3450
01:19:28,790 --> 01:19:28,800

4874
02:00:47,669 --> 02:00:47,679
maybe that's what
 

4875
02:00:47,679 --> 02:00:51,270

got my waiting room shadow banned

4876
02:00:51,270 --> 02:00:51,280
got my waiting room shadow banned
 

4877
02:00:51,280 --> 02:00:54,390
got my waiting room shadow banned
eh i don't know it's weird but

4878
02:00:54,390 --> 02:00:54,400
eh i don't know it's weird but
 

4879
02:00:54,400 --> 02:00:56,229
eh i don't know it's weird but
like i don't want to take the pre-chat

4880
02:00:56,229 --> 02:00:56,239
like i don't want to take the pre-chat
 

4881
02:00:56,239 --> 02:00:58,310
like i don't want to take the pre-chat
away from you guys

4882
02:00:58,310 --> 02:00:58,320
away from you guys
 

4883
02:00:58,320 --> 02:01:01,430
away from you guys
but it seems to

4884
02:01:01,430 --> 02:01:01,440
but it seems to
 

4885
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:04,550
but it seems to
sometimes even though we don't want it

4886
02:01:04,550 --> 02:01:04,560
sometimes even though we don't want it
 

4887
02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:06,070
sometimes even though we don't want it
to cause anything and

4888
02:01:06,070 --> 02:01:06,080
to cause anything and
 

4889
02:01:06,080 --> 02:01:07,830
to cause anything and
you guys don't even write anything bad

4890
02:01:07,830 --> 02:01:07,840
you guys don't even write anything bad
 

4891
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:10,550
you guys don't even write anything bad
in there but it can cause

4892
02:01:10,550 --> 02:01:10,560
in there but it can cause
 

4893
02:01:10,560 --> 02:01:12,149
in there but it can cause
something and i think probably just the

4894
02:01:12,149 --> 02:01:12,159
something and i think probably just the
 

4895
02:01:12,159 --> 02:01:14,390
something and i think probably just the
fact that we mentioned the word shadow

4896
02:01:14,390 --> 02:01:14,400
fact that we mentioned the word shadow
 

4897
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:15,589
fact that we mentioned the word shadow
band in the chat

4898
02:01:15,589 --> 02:01:15,599
band in the chat
 

4899
02:01:15,599 --> 02:01:20,149
band in the chat
itself is also not very beneficial

4900
02:01:20,149 --> 02:01:20,159
itself is also not very beneficial
 

4901
02:01:20,159 --> 02:01:23,270
itself is also not very beneficial
so maybe from now on we should just not

4902
02:01:23,270 --> 02:01:23,280
so maybe from now on we should just not
 

4903
02:01:23,280 --> 02:01:24,149
so maybe from now on we should just not
mention

4904
02:01:24,149 --> 02:01:24,159
mention
 

4905
02:01:24,159 --> 02:01:26,229
mention
the word anymore and just say something

4906
02:01:26,229 --> 02:01:26,239

4907
02:01:26,239 --> 02:01:27,750
the word anymore and just say something
like

4908
02:01:27,750 --> 02:01:27,760

lot of issues
 

6633
02:45:23,200 --> 02:45:25,429
lot of issues
um in the beginning if we look back i

6634
02:45:25,429 --> 02:45:25,439
um in the beginning if we look back i
 

6635
02:45:25,439 --> 02:45:27,110
um in the beginning if we look back i
think we can all remember that i had

6636
02:45:27,110 --> 02:45:27,120
think we can all remember that i had
 

6637
02:45:27,120 --> 02:45:28,469
think we can all remember that i had
some issues

6638
02:45:28,469 --> 02:45:28,479
some issues
 

6639
02:45:28,479 --> 02:45:32,790
some issues
with my elgato many times

6640
02:45:32,790 --> 02:45:32,800
with my elgato many times
 

6641
02:45:32,800 --> 02:45:36,790
with my elgato many times
uh but it stabilized itself after a

6642
02:45:36,790 --> 02:45:36,800
uh but it stabilized itself after a
 

6643
02:45:36,800 --> 02:45:37,830
uh but it stabilized itself after a
while

6644
02:45:37,830 --> 02:45:37,840
while
 

6645
02:45:37,840 --> 02:45:40,550
while
so i didn't buy a new game capture card

6646
02:45:40,550 --> 02:45:40,560
so i didn't buy a new game capture card
 

6647
02:45:40,560 --> 02:45:42,550
so i didn't buy a new game capture card
but hey there we go i have a i have one

6648
02:45:42,550 --> 02:45:42,560
but hey there we go i have a i have one
 

6649
02:45:42,560 --> 02:45:44,550
but hey there we go i have a i have one
built in in my pc now so i'll just have

6650
02:45:44,550 --> 02:45:44,560
built in in my pc now so i'll just have
 

6651
02:45:44,560 --> 02:45:54,830
built in in my pc now so i'll just have
to figure out how it works exactly

6652
02:45:54,830 --> 02:45:54,840

 

6653
02:45:54,840 --> 02:45:58,070

what

6654
02:45:58,070 --> 02:45:58,080

 

6655
02:45:58,080 --> 02:45:59,670

yes that's it that's it that's it thank

6656
02:45:59,670 --> 02:45:59,680
yes that's it that's it that's it thank
 

6657
02:45:59,680 --> 02:46:02,070
yes that's it that's it that's it thank
you i forgot the name

6658
02:46:02,070 --> 02:46:02,080
you i forgot the name
 

6659
02:46:02,080 --> 02:46:04,070
you i forgot the name
so i just need uh the avermedia software

6660
02:46:04,070 --> 02:46:04,080
so i just need uh the avermedia software
 

6661
02:46:04,080 --> 02:46:05,750
so i just need uh the avermedia software
and then it should work i guess

6662
02:46:05,750 --> 02:46:05,760
and then it should work i guess
 

6663
02:46:05,760 --> 02:46:34,790
and then it should work i guess
so i know

6664
02:46:34,790 --> 02:46:34,800

 

6665
02:46:34,800 --> 02:46:36,389

so yeah i'll try to figure out maybe

6666
02:46:36,389 --> 02:46:36,399
so yeah i'll try to figure out maybe
 

6667
02:46:36,399 --> 02:46:38,550
so yeah i'll try to figure out maybe
that one is easier to use

6668
02:46:38,550 --> 02:46:38,560
that one is easier to use
 

6669
02:46:38,560 --> 02:46:41,830
that one is easier to use
i'll try to figure it out

6670
02:46:41,830 --> 02:46:41,840
i'll try to figure it out
 

6671
02:46:41,840 --> 02:46:45,349
i'll try to figure it out
very interesting um

6672
02:46:45,349 --> 02:46:45,359
very interesting um
 

6673
02:46:45,359 --> 02:46:49,750
