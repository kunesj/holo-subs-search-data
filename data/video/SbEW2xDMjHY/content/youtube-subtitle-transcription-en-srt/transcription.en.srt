301
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,629

302
00:11:57,629 --> 00:11:57,639
next raid will be super strong we're
 

303

305
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,550
ready we're going to do it we're going
to destroy okay we together I think that

306
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:03,560
to destroy okay we together I think that
 

307
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,269
to destroy okay we together I think that
it also has to do with our levels and

308
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:05,279
it also has to do with our levels and
 

309
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,470
it also has to do with our levels and
stuff so since no one L I think so

310
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:08,480
stuff so since no one L I think so
 

311
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,670
