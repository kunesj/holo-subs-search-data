1099
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:22,149
i think
i may have been aware of ax happening

1100
00:28:22,149 --> 00:28:22,159
i may have been aware of ax happening
 

1101

1104
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:24,720
but
 

1105
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,909
but
i think

1106
00:28:25,909 --> 00:28:25,919
i think
 

1107
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,710
i think
i didn't want to stay because i think my

1108
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:28,720
i didn't want to stay because i think my
 

1109
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,909

1111
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,630
stay was like 10 to 11 days
i think 11 i think

1112
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:34,640
i think 11 i think
 

1113
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,990
i think 11 i think
um so

1114
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:36,000

1395
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,790
because i did have
not much time

1396
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:10,800
not much time
 

1397
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,510
not much time
for

1398
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:11,520
for
 

1399
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,230
for
changing and i had to go

1400
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:14,240
changing and i had to go
 

1401
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,629
changing and i had to go
basically from one side of the airport

1402
00:34:16,629 --> 00:34:16,639
basically from one side of the airport
 

1403
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,710
basically from one side of the airport
to the other and i had to

1404
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:18,720
to the other and i had to
 

1405
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,829
to the other and i had to
i had like i think i had like 40 minutes

1406
00:34:21,829 --> 00:34:21,839
i had like i think i had like 40 minutes
 

1407
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:22,950
i had like i think i had like 40 minutes
or so

1408
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:22,960
or so
 

1409
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,430
or so
and i had to go from like terminal one

1410
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:25,440
and i had to go from like terminal one
 

1411
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,030
and i had to go from like terminal one
to terminal

1412
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:27,040
to terminal
 

1413
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,310
to terminal
wherever

1414
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:28,320
wherever
 

1415
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,069
wherever
and so [\h__\h] far away i had to only

1416
00:34:32,069 --> 00:34:32,079
and so [\h__\h] far away i had to only
 

1417
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,750
and so [\h__\h] far away i had to only
first of all you know i was i was

1418
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:33,760
first of all you know i was i was
 

1419
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,869
first of all you know i was i was
following the signs that said um

1420
00:34:36,869 --> 00:34:36,879
following the signs that said um
 

1421
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:40,950
following the signs that said um
terminal one two three four five etc

1422
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:40,960
terminal one two three four five etc
 

1423
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,869
terminal one two three four five etc
and at some point

1424
00:34:42,869 --> 00:34:42,879
and at some point
 

1425
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:45,589
and at some point
the terminal i was going to

1426
00:34:45,589 --> 00:34:45,599
the terminal i was going to
 

1427
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,510
the terminal i was going to
disappeared from the signs even though i

1428
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:47,520
disappeared from the signs even though i
 

1429
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,510
disappeared from the signs even though i
was just normally following them first

1430
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:49,520
was just normally following them first
 

1431
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,230
was just normally following them first
of all that's confusing

1432
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:52,240

1433
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,030

is the most obnoxious thing when you're

1500
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:11,680
is the most obnoxious thing when you're
 

1501
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,630
is the most obnoxious thing when you're
doing transit and makes me think that

1502
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:14,640
doing transit and makes me think that
 

1503
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,310
doing transit and makes me think that
this airport was not planned very well

1504
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:18,320
this airport was not planned very well
 

1505
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,630
this airport was not planned very well
and that is apparently america's biggest

1506
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:20,640
and that is apparently america's biggest
 

1507
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,670
and that is apparently america's biggest
airport

1508
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:21,680
airport
 

1509
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,829
airport
if it requires you

1510
00:36:23,829 --> 00:36:23,839
if it requires you
 

1511
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:26,470
if it requires you
to leave the airport once

1512
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:26,480
to leave the airport once
 

1513
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,910
to leave the airport once
completely

1514
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:27,920
completely
 

1515
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,790
completely
then you're doing something wrong

1516
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:30,800
then you're doing something wrong
 

1517
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,030
then you're doing something wrong
with the planning and creation of the

1518
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:33,040
with the planning and creation of the
 

1519
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,910

2234
00:51:56,470 --> 00:51:56,480
forward to but i mean i guess it doesn't
 

2235
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,510
forward to but i mean i guess it doesn't

01:13:32,149 --> 01:13:32,159
it takes a lot of like calibration and
 

3253
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:33,750
it takes a lot of like calibration and
[\h__\h] um

[\h__\h] um
 

3255
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:35,830
[\h__\h] um
and it takes some time so it was kind of

3256
01:13:35,830 --> 01:13:35,840
and it takes some time so it was kind of
 

3257
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:38,070
and it takes some time so it was kind of
scuffed but at least we got it done it

3258
01:13:38,070 --> 01:13:38,080
scuffed but at least we got it done it

4441
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,189
yeah so i couldn't use it anymore at
some point

4442
01:36:13,189 --> 01:36:13,199
some point
 

4443
01:36:13,199 --> 01:36:15,990
some point
and we also tried like this big big big

4444
01:36:15,990 --> 01:36:16,000
and we also tried like this big big big
 

4445
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,510
and we also tried like this big big big
piece of

4446
01:36:17,510 --> 01:36:17,520
piece of
 

4447
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:18,310
piece of
like

4448
01:36:18,310 --> 01:36:18,320
like
 

4449
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:19,910
like
plastic

4450
01:36:19,910 --> 01:36:19,920
plastic
 

4451
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:21,750
plastic
ground thing

ground thing
 

4453
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:24,310
ground thing
but that ended up like kind of

4454
01:36:24,310 --> 01:36:24,320
but that ended up like kind of
 

4455
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:27,430
but that ended up like kind of
interfering with the capturing

4456
01:36:27,430 --> 01:36:27,440
interfering with the capturing
 

4457
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:30,070
interfering with the capturing
um because of like reflection and [\h__\h]
