I'm not sure because this really

1138
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:39,320
I'm not sure because this really
 

1139
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,710
I'm not sure because this really
intimidated me now I'm not sure if we

1140
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:41,720
intimidated me now I'm not sure if we
 

1141
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,950
intimidated me now I'm not sure if we
want to like try this

1142
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:43,960
want to like try this
 

1143
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,509
want to like try this
again if we try it again it might be a

1144
00:33:46,509 --> 00:33:46,519
again if we try it again it might be a
 

1145
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:48,549
again if we try it again it might be a
different phrase or we go back to the

1146
00:33:48,549 --> 00:33:48,559
different phrase or we go back to the
 

1147
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,710
different phrase or we go back to the
original I don't

1148
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:50,720
original I don't
 

1149
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,350
original I don't

1153
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,350
know I think one of the problem is also
maybe that the back vocals were still

1154
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:02,360
maybe that the back vocals were still

1180
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:40,440
generally it will follow that kind of
 

1181
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,109
generally it will follow that kind of
pattern uh I think I think everybody

1182
00:34:43,109 --> 00:34:43,119
pattern uh I think I think everybody
 

1183
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:45,790
pattern uh I think I think everybody
always gets one solo I think and there

1184
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:45,800
always gets one solo I think and there
 

1185
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,149
always gets one solo I think and there
will always be units and

1186
00:34:48,149 --> 00:34:48,159
will always be units and
 

1187
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,109
will always be units and
stuff but just so you know we'll be

1188
00:34:50,109 --> 00:34:50,119
stuff but just so you know we'll be
 

1189
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:52,710
stuff but just so you know we'll be
mixing it up yeah I really like the

1190
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:52,720
mixing it up yeah I really like the
 

1191
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,550
mixing it up yeah I really like the
setup too like all except for like you

1192
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:56,560
setup too like all except for like you
 

1193
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,470
setup too like all except for like you
know depending on on um the venue the

1194
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:01,480
know depending on on um the venue the
 

1195
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:06,310
know depending on on um the venue the
sizes of the area where we can dance

1196
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:06,320
sizes of the area where we can dance
 

1197
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,990
sizes of the area where we can dance
will be difficult and so when we were

1198
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:10,000
will be difficult and so when we were
 

1199
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,349
will be difficult and so when we were
practicing for this

1200
00:35:14,349 --> 00:35:14,359

 

1201
00:35:14,359 --> 00:35:18,750

one we were uh first we were practicing

1202
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:18,760
one we were uh first we were practicing
 

1203
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:24,910
one we were uh first we were practicing
in like a wide formation and then at

1204
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:24,920
in like a wide formation and then at
 

1205
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,870
in like a wide formation and then at
rehearsal pretty suddenly we were told

1206
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:27,880
rehearsal pretty suddenly we were told
 

1207
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,069
rehearsal pretty suddenly we were told
oh actually you only have this tiny

1208
00:35:31,069 --> 00:35:31,079
oh actually you only have this tiny
 

1209
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:35,310
oh actually you only have this tiny
space here uh as you can see and I'm

1210
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:35,320
space here uh as you can see and I'm
 

1211
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,030
space here uh as you can see and I'm
like what [\h__\h] and then we went through

1212
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:38,040
like what [\h__\h] and then we went through
 

1213
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:42,109
like what [\h__\h] and then we went through
it a little bit and uh like I was

1214
00:35:42,109 --> 00:35:42,119
it a little bit and uh like I was
 

1215
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:44,710
it a little bit and uh like I was
bumping a little bit my arms like

1216
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:44,720
bumping a little bit my arms like
 

1217
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,030
bumping a little bit my arms like
against the

1218
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:47,040
against the
 

1219
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,750
against the
others yeah it was uh difficult to

1220
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:49,760
others yeah it was uh difficult to
 

1221
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:54,069
others yeah it was uh difficult to
squeeze in in such a tiny space um I

1222
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:54,079
squeeze in in such a tiny space um I
 

1223
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:55,910
squeeze in in such a tiny space um I
think you noticed maybe if you were

1224
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:55,920
think you noticed maybe if you were
 

1225
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,069
think you noticed maybe if you were
there that especially with the group

1226
00:35:58,069 --> 00:35:58,079
there that especially with the group
 

1227
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,230
there that especially with the group
songs um even with doyu though with four

1228
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:01,240
songs um even with doyu though with four
 

1229
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,190
songs um even with doyu though with four
people but also with the group songs

1230
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:03,200
people but also with the group songs
 

1231
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,069
people but also with the group songs
that we were really close to each other

1232
00:36:05,069 --> 00:36:05,079
that we were really close to each other
 

1233
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:07,230
that we were really close to each other
but then because we literally can't

1234
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:07,240
but then because we literally can't
 

1235
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,190
but then because we literally can't
stand in one line I think there's like

1236
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:10,200
stand in one line I think there's like
 

1237
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,069
stand in one line I think there's like
always people standing in the back and

1238
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:12,079
always people standing in the back and
 

1239
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,910
always people standing in the back and
then people standing in the

1240
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:14,920
then people standing in the
 

1241
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:18,710
then people standing in the
front and yeah just difficult because

1242
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:18,720
front and yeah just difficult because
 

1243
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:36,829
front and yeah just difficult because
the motion capture area was very small

1244
00:36:36,829 --> 00:36:36,839

 

1245
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:38,990

so yeah had to

1246
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:39,000
so yeah had to
 

1247
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,589
so yeah had to
adjust had to adjust like pretty

1248
00:36:43,589 --> 00:36:43,599
adjust had to adjust like pretty
 

1249
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:46,870
adjust had to adjust like pretty
spontaneously bit difficult but still

1250
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:46,880
spontaneously bit difficult but still
 

1251
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,510
spontaneously bit difficult but still
had a lot of

1252
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:48,520
had a lot of
 

1253
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:52,470
had a lot of
fun I like the setup I liked it um I

1254
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:52,480
fun I like the setup I liked it um I
 

1255
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,230
fun I like the setup I liked it um I
think like the problem in this uh anime

1256
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:55,240
think like the problem in this uh anime
 

1257
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:58,230
think like the problem in this uh anime
NYC venue is that it's isn't there like

1258
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:58,240
NYC venue is that it's isn't there like
 

1259
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,630
NYC venue is that it's isn't there like
these pillars right these big pillars so

1260
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:01,640
these pillars right these big pillars so
 

1261
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,150
these pillars right these big pillars so
you can't really stand behind the pillar

1262
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:04,160
you can't really stand behind the pillar
 

1263
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,349
you can't really stand behind the pillar
people have to like keep all that space

1264
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:06,359
people have to like keep all that space
 

1265
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:08,950
people have to like keep all that space
empty more or less so there's some

1266
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:08,960
empty more or less so there's some
 

1267
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,790
empty more or less so there's some
wasted space but you see here on the

1268
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:10,800
wasted space but you see here on the
 

1269
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,710
wasted space but you see here on the
picture that's not all there's like a

1270
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:12,720
picture that's not all there's like a
 

1271
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,270
picture that's not all there's like a
little bit of like walking space uh here

1272
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:16,280
little bit of like walking space uh here
 

1273
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,109
little bit of like walking space uh here
at the bottom um but it the the crowd

1274
00:37:19,109 --> 00:37:19,119
at the bottom um but it the the crowd
 

1275
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:21,589
at the bottom um but it the the crowd
continues behind that so it was pretty

1276
00:37:21,589 --> 00:37:21,599
continues behind that so it was pretty
 

1277
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,870
continues behind that so it was pretty
packed I think right like quite quite a

1278
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:24,880
packed I think right like quite quite a
 

1279
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,270
packed I think right like quite quite a
big amount of people in there uh even

1280
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:27,280
big amount of people in there uh even
 

1281
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,950
big amount of people in there uh even
though it's kind of awkward with the

1282
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:29,960
though it's kind of awkward with the
 

1283
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:33,230
though it's kind of awkward with the
pillars and yeah everybody I guess

1284
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:33,240
pillars and yeah everybody I guess
 

1285
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,190
pillars and yeah everybody I guess
stands on the same level

1286
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:35,200
stands on the same level
 

1287
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,870
stands on the same level
so probably was hard to

1288
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:38,880
so probably was hard to
 

1289
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,870
so probably was hard to
see like the full body version in the

1290
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:41,880
see like the full body version in the
 

1291
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,790
see like the full body version in the
middle if you're not in a good seat like

1292
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:45,800
middle if you're not in a good seat like
 

1293
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:49,069
middle if you're not in a good seat like
but you know that's just an issue with

1294
00:37:49,069 --> 00:37:49,079
but you know that's just an issue with
 

1295
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:51,950
but you know that's just an issue with
each of the convention venues whether or

1296
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:51,960
each of the convention venues whether or
 

1297
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,589
each of the convention venues whether or

the show I just watched
that it's such a classic I'm so glad

it's kind of different from the show
 

2527

because I think in the show it's like
it's not a restaurant where you can sit

it's not a restaurant where you can sit
 

2531

it's not a restaurant where you can sit
down but it's at least like kind of

2532
01:06:18,910 --> 01:06:18,920
down but it's at least like kind of
 

2533
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:22,190

01:06:22,190 --> 01:06:22,200
inside you walk into something this was
 

2535

um popular and fitting while when you're

um popular and fitting while when you're

5683
02:20:42,240 --> 02:20:45,630
but I thought if we want to do
something that leaves uh a great

5684
02:20:45,630 --> 02:20:45,640
something that leaves uh a great
 

5685
02:20:45,640 --> 02:20:47,830
something that leaves uh a great
impression then we should do a cool song

7020
02:52:51,630 --> 02:52:51,640
the phone I saying like maybe they're
 

7021
02:52:51,640 --> 02:52:53,389
the phone I saying like maybe they're
like cutting it off Somehow Here the

7022
02:52:53,389 --> 02:52:53,399
like cutting it off Somehow Here the
 

7023
02:52:53,399 --> 02:52:56,510
like cutting it off Somehow Here the
signal so that people can't look it

7024
02:52:56,510 --> 02:52:56,520
signal so that people can't look it
 

7025
02:52:56,520 --> 02:53:00,229
signal so that people can't look it
up and then also like um I was thinking

7026
02:53:00,229 --> 02:53:00,239
up and then also like um I was thinking
 

7027
02:53:00,239 --> 02:53:02,870
up and then also like um I was thinking
like uh this this was proven to be wrong

7028
02:53:02,870 --> 02:53:02,880
like uh this this was proven to be wrong
 

7029
02:53:02,880 --> 02:53:04,190
like uh this this was proven to be wrong
because Amy just didn't have enough

7030
02:53:04,190 --> 02:53:04,200
because Amy just didn't have enough
 

7031
02:53:04,200 --> 02:53:06,870
because Amy just didn't have enough
credit on her credit card apparently but

7032
02:53:06,870 --> 02:53:06,880
credit on her credit card apparently but
 

7033
02:53:06,880 --> 02:53:08,309
credit on her credit card apparently but
I was thinking like maybe her card

7034
02:53:08,309 --> 02:53:08,319
I was thinking like maybe her card
 

7035
02:53:08,319 --> 02:53:10,030
I was thinking like maybe her card
didn't work because credit cards are

7036
02:53:10,030 --> 02:53:10,040
didn't work because credit cards are
 

7037
02:53:10,040 --> 02:53:11,830
didn't work because credit cards are
easier to get your money back than debit

7038
02:53:11,830 --> 02:53:11,840
easier to get your money back than debit
 

7039
02:53:11,840 --> 02:53:13,550
easier to get your money back than debit
cards and they just don't let credit

7040
02:53:13,550 --> 02:53:13,560
cards and they just don't let credit
 

7041
02:53:13,560 --> 02:53:14,429
cards and they just don't let credit
cards

7042
02:53:14,429 --> 02:53:14,439
cards
 

7043
02:53:14,439 --> 02:53:16,750
cards
work um that's why my card worked but

7044
02:53:16,750 --> 02:53:16,760
work um that's why my card worked but
 

7045
02:53:16,760 --> 02:53:18,710
work um that's why my card worked but
hers didn't then this was proven to be

7046
02:53:18,710 --> 02:53:18,720
hers didn't then this was proven to be
 

7047
02:53:18,720 --> 02:53:21,309
hers didn't then this was proven to be
wrong but it would have been

7048
02:53:21,309 --> 02:53:21,319
wrong but it would have been
 

7049
02:53:21,319 --> 02:53:24,870
wrong but it would have been
