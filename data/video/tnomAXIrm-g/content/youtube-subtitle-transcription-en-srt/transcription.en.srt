it eventually ends up working which is
 

13263
05:18:00,718 --> 05:18:03,270
it eventually ends up working which is
just not realistic he should be dead by

13264
05:18:03,270 --> 05:18:03,280
just not realistic he should be dead by
 

13265
05:18:03,280 --> 05:18:04,788

but it is quite the character
 

13271
05:18:07,120 --> 05:18:09,030
but it is quite the character
development and as i said i understand

13272
05:18:09,030 --> 05:18:09,040
development and as i said i understand
 

13273
05:18:09,040 --> 05:18:10,948
development and as i said i understand
why they did it because he's he is a

13274
05:18:10,948 --> 05:18:10,958
why they did it because he's he is a
 

13275
05:18:10,958 --> 05:18:12,948
why they did it because he's he is a
