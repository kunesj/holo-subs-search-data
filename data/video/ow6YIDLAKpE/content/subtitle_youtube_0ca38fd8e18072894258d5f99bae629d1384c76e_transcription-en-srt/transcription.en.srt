101
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,689
um but I'm not a b but you know actually
like you know now now you probably hear

102
00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:41,699
like you know now now you probably hear
 

103
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:45,110
like you know now now you probably hear
it very loudly do you do you now now

104
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:45,120
it very loudly do you do you now now
 

105
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,629
it very loudly do you do you now now
even louder do you hear this

106
00:05:47,629 --> 00:05:47,639
even louder do you hear this
 

107
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,810

because I had to record myself

144
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:38,100
because I had to record myself
 

145
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:42,230
because I had to record myself
um and listen to the no bgm version

146
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:42,240
um and listen to the no bgm version
 

147
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,850
um and listen to the no bgm version
and then I hear this [\h__\h] what the [\h__\h]

148
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:46,860
and then I hear this [\h__\h] what the [\h__\h]

this is the result uh I tuned down the
 

155
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,650
this is the result uh I tuned down the
high frequencies but I feel like it

156
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:57,660
high frequencies but I feel like it
 

157
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:04,189
high frequencies but I feel like it
takes away a lot else than just dubs
