it was so short I I kind of was planning
 

1527
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,410
it was so short I I kind of was planning
it for

1528
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:36,420
it for
 

1529
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,530
it for
a while already

1530
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:39,540
a while already
 

1531
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:42,770
a while already
uh it was not as spontaneous as it

1532
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:42,780
uh it was not as spontaneous as it
 

1533
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:45,349
uh it was not as spontaneous as it
looked like to you guys

1534
00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:45,359
looked like to you guys
 

1535
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:49,870

00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,430
uh I just wanted I thought you know
for some reason I thought ID would be

1538
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:52,440
for some reason I thought ID would be
 

1539
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,410
for some reason I thought ID would be
relatively close to Japan because

1540
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:54,420
relatively close to Japan because
 

1541
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:57,589
relatively close to Japan because
there's only a two hour time difference

1542
00:37:57,589 --> 00:37:57,599
there's only a two hour time difference
 

1543
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,810
there's only a two hour time difference
so it would be easy to go from Japan to

1544
00:37:59,810 --> 00:37:59,820
so it would be easy to go from Japan to
 

1545
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:05,150
so it would be easy to go from Japan to
ID turns out well it wasn't

1546
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:05,160

 

1547
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,569

it was still a seven to eight hour

1548
00:38:08,569 --> 00:38:08,579
it was still a seven to eight hour
 

1549
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:10,970
it was still a seven to eight hour
flight

1550
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:10,980
flight
 

1551
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,050
flight
um

1552
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:12,060
um
 

1553
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,370
um
which

1554
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:13,380
which
 

1555
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:16,970
which
you know to get to Japan if there were

1556
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:16,980
you know to get to Japan if there were
 

1557
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:20,270
you know to get to Japan if there were

and I type in uh the airport name
 

3937

and I know that I need to go to I think
 

3939
01:32:55,620 --> 01:32:58,490
and I know that I need to go to I think
terminal free I think it was

3940
01:32:58,490 --> 01:32:58,500
terminal free I think it was
 

3941
01:32:58,500 --> 01:33:02,209
terminal free I think it was
so maybe people who live there and use

3942
01:33:02,209 --> 01:33:02,219
so maybe people who live there and use
 

3943
01:33:02,219 --> 01:33:04,669
so maybe people who live there and use
that app and have tried to type that in

3944
01:33:04,669 --> 01:33:04,679
that app and have tried to type that in
 

3945
01:33:04,679 --> 01:33:06,770
that app and have tried to type that in
know what I'm talking about

3946
01:33:06,770 --> 01:33:06,780
know what I'm talking about
 

3947
01:33:06,780 --> 01:33:09,890
know what I'm talking about
but there's something really confusing

3948
01:33:09,890 --> 01:33:09,900
but there's something really confusing
 

3949
01:33:09,900 --> 01:33:11,629
but there's something really confusing
at least from my point of view it was

3950
01:33:11,629 --> 01:33:11,639
at least from my point of view it was
 

3951
01:33:11,639 --> 01:33:13,790
at least from my point of view it was
really confusing there's I think there's

3952
01:33:13,790 --> 01:33:13,800
really confusing there's I think there's
 

3953
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:15,649
really confusing there's I think there's
free terminals

3954
01:33:15,649 --> 01:33:15,659
free terminals
 

3955
01:33:15,659 --> 01:33:17,149
free terminals
and

3956
01:33:17,149 --> 01:33:17,159
and
 

3957
01:33:17,159 --> 01:33:19,729
and
one I think it's the first one the first

3958
01:33:19,729 --> 01:33:19,739
one I think it's the first one the first
 

3959
01:33:19,739 --> 01:33:22,610
one I think it's the first one the first
terminal I think is mostly for

3960
01:33:22,610 --> 01:33:22,620
terminal I think is mostly for
 

3961
01:33:22,620 --> 01:33:26,870
terminal I think is mostly for
uh domestic flights but it does

3962
01:33:26,870 --> 01:33:26,880
uh domestic flights but it does
 

3963
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:28,370
uh domestic flights but it does
have

3964
01:33:28,370 --> 01:33:28,380
have
 

3965
01:33:28,380 --> 01:33:31,250
have
some international flights

3966
01:33:31,250 --> 01:33:31,260
some international flights
 

3967
01:33:31,260 --> 01:33:32,629
some international flights
on

3968
01:33:32,629 --> 01:33:32,639
on
 

3969
01:33:32,639 --> 01:33:34,910
on
a section of the terminal that's called

3970
01:33:34,910 --> 01:33:34,920
a section of the terminal that's called
 

3971
01:33:34,920 --> 01:33:37,010
a section of the terminal that's called
gate free so they have like gate one

3972
01:33:37,010 --> 01:33:37,020
gate free so they have like gate one
 

3973
01:33:37,020 --> 01:33:39,470
gate free so they have like gate one
gate two gate free get four and so on

3974
01:33:39,470 --> 01:33:39,480
gate two gate free get four and so on
 

3975
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:42,770
gate two gate free get four and so on
until five I think but that doesn't mean

3976
01:33:42,770 --> 01:33:42,780
until five I think but that doesn't mean
 

3977
01:33:42,780 --> 01:33:45,350
until five I think but that doesn't mean
that it's not the gates that are inside

3978
01:33:45,350 --> 01:33:45,360
that it's not the gates that are inside
 

3979
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:48,410
that it's not the gates that are inside
you know that go from like one to 60 70

3980
01:33:48,410 --> 01:33:48,420
you know that go from like one to 60 70
 

3981
01:33:48,420 --> 01:33:49,729
you know that go from like one to 60 70
or whatever you know those are different

3982
01:33:49,729 --> 01:33:49,739
or whatever you know those are different
 

3983
01:33:49,739 --> 01:33:50,870
or whatever you know those are different
Gates

3984
01:33:50,870 --> 01:33:50,880
Gates
 

3985
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:53,030
Gates
for some reason they call that gate one

3986
01:33:53,030 --> 01:33:53,040
for some reason they call that gate one
 

3987
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:55,010
for some reason they call that gate one
two three and so on outside where the

3988
01:33:55,010 --> 01:33:55,020
two three and so on outside where the
 

3989
01:33:55,020 --> 01:33:57,649
two three and so on outside where the
taxis would stop and drop you off and

3990
01:33:57,649 --> 01:33:57,659
taxis would stop and drop you off and
 

3991
01:33:57,659 --> 01:34:00,229
taxis would stop and drop you off and
depending on the gate you know gate one

3992
01:34:00,229 --> 01:34:00,239
depending on the gate you know gate one
 

3993
01:34:00,239 --> 01:34:02,570
depending on the gate you know gate one
to two would be domestic flights and

3994
01:34:02,570 --> 01:34:02,580
to two would be domestic flights and
 

3995
01:34:02,580 --> 01:34:06,290
to two would be domestic flights and
then free was apparently International

3996
01:34:06,290 --> 01:34:06,300
then free was apparently International
 

3997
01:34:06,300 --> 01:34:08,930
then free was apparently International
and that's the thing they had for all

3998
01:34:08,930 --> 01:34:08,940
and that's the thing they had for all
 

3999
01:34:08,940 --> 01:34:10,970
and that's the thing they had for all
the terminals

4000
01:34:10,970 --> 01:34:10,980
the terminals
 

4001
01:34:10,980 --> 01:34:13,490
the terminals
following me so far okay good now here

4002
01:34:13,490 --> 01:34:13,500
following me so far okay good now here
 

4003
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:15,890
following me so far okay good now here
is the problem

4004
01:34:15,890 --> 01:34:15,900
is the problem
 

4005
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:19,669
is the problem
I typed in the airport name and then it

4006
01:34:19,669 --> 01:34:19,679
I typed in the airport name and then it
 

4007
01:34:19,679 --> 01:34:21,770
I typed in the airport name and then it
gave me several suggestions

4008
01:34:21,770 --> 01:34:21,780
gave me several suggestions
 

4009
01:34:21,780 --> 01:34:24,890
gave me several suggestions
I swear it did not show me Terminal 3

4010
01:34:24,890 --> 01:34:24,900
I swear it did not show me Terminal 3
 

4011
01:34:24,900 --> 01:34:26,689
I swear it did not show me Terminal 3
suggestion for some reason

4012
01:34:26,689 --> 01:34:26,699
suggestion for some reason
 

4013
01:34:26,699 --> 01:34:29,930
suggestion for some reason
what it did show me was terminal

4014
01:34:29,930 --> 01:34:29,940
what it did show me was terminal
 

4015
01:34:29,940 --> 01:34:34,669
what it did show me was terminal
1 international flights gate free

4016
01:34:34,669 --> 01:34:34,679
1 international flights gate free
 

4017
01:34:34,679 --> 01:34:36,050
1 international flights gate free
so

4018
01:34:36,050 --> 01:34:36,060
so
 

4019
01:34:36,060 --> 01:34:37,729
so
since I didn't see anything else that

4020
01:34:37,729 --> 01:34:37,739
since I didn't see anything else that
 

4021
01:34:37,739 --> 01:34:39,649
since I didn't see anything else that
said international flights and the

4022
01:34:39,649 --> 01:34:39,659
said international flights and the
 

4023
01:34:39,659 --> 01:34:42,470
said international flights and the
number three I was like um I guess

4024
01:34:42,470 --> 01:34:42,480
number three I was like um I guess
 

4025
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:44,570
number three I was like um I guess
that's it

4026
01:34:44,570 --> 01:34:44,580
that's it
 

4027
01:34:44,580 --> 01:34:48,110
that's it
I I guess that's it

4028
01:34:48,110 --> 01:34:48,120
I I guess that's it
 

4029
01:34:48,120 --> 01:34:52,910
I I guess that's it
so I choose that

4030
01:34:52,910 --> 01:34:52,920

 

4031
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:56,629

and yeah it was the wrong terminal but

4032
01:34:56,629 --> 01:34:56,639
and yeah it was the wrong terminal but
 

4033
01:34:56,639 --> 01:34:59,629
and yeah it was the wrong terminal but
he dropped me off the taxi driver and I

4034
01:34:59,629 --> 01:34:59,639
he dropped me off the taxi driver and I
 

4035
01:34:59,639 --> 01:35:01,430
he dropped me off the taxi driver and I
was like wandering around the terminal I

4036
01:35:01,430 --> 01:35:01,440
was like wandering around the terminal I
 

4037
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:02,209
was like wandering around the terminal I
was like

4038
01:35:02,209 --> 01:35:02,219
was like
 

4039
01:35:02,219 --> 01:35:05,810
was like
I immediately knew this wasn't it but I

4040
01:35:05,810 --> 01:35:05,820
I immediately knew this wasn't it but I
 

4041
01:35:05,820 --> 01:35:08,209
I immediately knew this wasn't it but I
was looking for

4042
01:35:08,209 --> 01:35:08,219
was looking for
 

4043
01:35:08,219 --> 01:35:11,870
was looking for
you know maybe I'm wrong but I when I

4044
01:35:11,870 --> 01:35:11,880
you know maybe I'm wrong but I when I
 

4045
01:35:11,880 --> 01:35:13,070
you know maybe I'm wrong but I when I
looked at the flight schedule I

4046
01:35:13,070 --> 01:35:13,080
looked at the flight schedule I
 

4047
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:15,350
looked at the flight schedule I
immediately saw there's these are all

4048
01:35:15,350 --> 01:35:15,360
immediately saw there's these are all
 

4049
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:18,709
immediately saw there's these are all
not going anywhere outside of this

4050
01:35:18,709 --> 01:35:18,719
not going anywhere outside of this
 

4051
01:35:18,719 --> 01:35:21,649
not going anywhere outside of this
continent

4052
01:35:21,649 --> 01:35:21,659

 

4053
01:35:21,659 --> 01:35:24,590

so I was like okay time wise I'm still

4054
01:35:24,590 --> 01:35:24,600
so I was like okay time wise I'm still
 

4055
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:27,169
so I was like okay time wise I'm still
probably fine but how am I gonna get to

4056
01:35:27,169 --> 01:35:27,179
probably fine but how am I gonna get to
 

4057
01:35:27,179 --> 01:35:30,890
probably fine but how am I gonna get to
the other terminal so I I I I've tried

4058
01:35:30,890 --> 01:35:30,900
the other terminal so I I I I've tried
 

4059
01:35:30,900 --> 01:35:32,270
the other terminal so I I I I've tried
to find

4060
01:35:32,270 --> 01:35:32,280
to find
 

4061
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:34,490
to find
this was so stupid because there were

4062
01:35:34,490 --> 01:35:34,500
this was so stupid because there were
 

4063
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:37,250
this was so stupid because there were
there was a an Ebro that said terminal

4064
01:35:37,250 --> 01:35:37,260
there was a an Ebro that said terminal
 

4065
01:35:37,260 --> 01:35:40,669
there was a an Ebro that said terminal
two and three and I followed that but

4066
01:35:40,669 --> 01:35:40,679
two and three and I followed that but
 

4067

times by other ID members that I should
only order taxes for the app where it

4230
01:39:07,970 --> 01:39:07,980
only order taxes for the app where it
 

4231
01:39:07,980 --> 01:39:09,530
only order taxes for the app where it
already says the price before you ride

4232
01:39:09,530 --> 01:39:09,540
already says the price before you ride
 

4233
01:39:09,540 --> 01:39:11,689
already says the price before you ride
it so I was being very careful you know

4234
01:39:11,689 --> 01:39:11,699
it so I was being very careful you know
 

4235
01:39:11,699 --> 01:39:13,490
it so I was being very careful you know
and I think in theory that's a good idea

4236
01:39:13,490 --> 01:39:13,500
and I think in theory that's a good idea
 

4237
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:16,310
and I think in theory that's a good idea
to have to be careful you know in a

4238
01:39:16,310 --> 01:39:16,320
to have to be careful you know in a
 

4239
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:18,410
to have to be careful you know in a
country where our scamming tourists uh

country where our scamming tourists uh
 

4241
01:39:18,420 --> 01:39:22,610
country where our scamming tourists uh

4242
01:39:22,610 --> 01:39:22,620

4245
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:26,990
you guys I'm surprised you guys say
that's expensive because

4246
01:39:26,990 --> 01:39:27,000

4267
01:39:49,860 --> 01:39:52,729
embarrassing I wanted to
like disappear but apparently it wasn't

4268
01:39:52,729 --> 01:39:52,739
like disappear but apparently it wasn't
 

4269
01:39:52,739 --> 01:39:55,370
like disappear but apparently it wasn't
that unreasonable apparently

4270
01:39:55,370 --> 01:39:55,380
that unreasonable apparently
 

4271
01:39:55,380 --> 01:39:57,649
that unreasonable apparently
according to you guys so I thought he

4272
01:39:57,649 --> 01:39:57,659
according to you guys so I thought he
 

4273
01:39:57,659 --> 01:39:59,450
according to you guys so I thought he
was scamming me like big deal I thought

4274
01:39:59,450 --> 01:39:59,460

4275
01:39:59,460 --> 01:40:02,390
was scamming me like big deal I thought
he was asking for a million rupees and I

4276
01:40:02,390 --> 01:40:02,400
he was asking for a million rupees and I
 

4277
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:05,030
he was asking for a million rupees and I
said no no that makes no sense I paid

4278
01:40:05,030 --> 01:40:05,040
said no no that makes no sense I paid
 

4279
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:06,830
said no no that makes no sense I paid
half of that

4280
01:40:06,830 --> 01:40:06,840
half of that
 

4281
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:09,229
half of that
uh to get to the airport from the city

4282
01:40:09,229 --> 01:40:09,239

center
 

4285
01:40:10,260 --> 01:40:12,470
center
so I'm not gonna pay double just to get

4286
01:40:12,470 --> 01:40:12,480
so I'm not gonna pay double just to get
 

4287
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:14,090
so I'm not gonna pay double just to get
to a different terminal

4288
01:40:14,090 --> 01:40:14,100
to a different terminal
 

4289
01:40:14,100 --> 01:40:16,010
to a different terminal
that's that's the reasoning I gave him I

4290
01:40:16,010 --> 01:40:16,020
that's that's the reasoning I gave him I
 

4291
01:40:16,020 --> 01:40:17,090
that's that's the reasoning I gave him I
said that it makes no sense that's too

4292
01:40:17,090 --> 01:40:17,100
said that it makes no sense that's too
 

4293
01:40:17,100 --> 01:40:18,530
said that it makes no sense that's too
expensive

4294
01:40:18,530 --> 01:40:18,540
expensive
 

4295
01:40:18,540 --> 01:40:21,890
expensive
but all the oh in my mind he was asking

4296
01:40:21,890 --> 01:40:21,900
but all the oh in my mind he was asking
 

4297
01:40:21,900 --> 01:40:26,830
but all the oh in my mind he was asking
for like a hundred bucks not for 10.

4298
01:40:26,830 --> 01:40:26,840

 

4299
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:31,790

and then he's like yeah no that's that's

4300
01:40:31,790 --> 01:40:31,800
and then he's like yeah no that's that's
 

4301
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:33,350
and then he's like yeah no that's that's
the price it has to be this price

4302
01:40:33,350 --> 01:40:33,360
the price it has to be this price
 

4303
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:36,110
the price it has to be this price
because this and that yes and he was not

4304
01:40:36,110 --> 01:40:36,120
because this and that yes and he was not
 

4305
01:40:36,120 --> 01:40:39,290
because this and that yes and he was not
like changing his mind and I said no

4306
01:40:39,290 --> 01:40:39,300
like changing his mind and I said no
 

4307
01:40:39,300 --> 01:40:40,790
like changing his mind and I said no
I'm still hoping that he would go down

4308
01:40:40,790 --> 01:40:40,800
I'm still hoping that he would go down
 

4309
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:43,430
I'm still hoping that he would go down
with the price you know that yeah I was

4310
01:40:43,430 --> 01:40:43,440
with the price you know that yeah I was
 

4311

4314
01:40:48,229 --> 01:40:48,239

 

4315
01:40:48,239 --> 01:40:49,729

because I really thought he was asking

4316
01:40:49,729 --> 01:40:49,739
because I really thought he was asking
 

4317
01:40:49,739 --> 01:40:50,930
because I really thought he was asking
for 100 bucks I thought that was really

4318
01:40:50,930 --> 01:40:50,940
for 100 bucks I thought that was really
 

4319
01:40:50,940 --> 01:40:52,250
for 100 bucks I thought that was really
unreasonable so I was like this is

4369
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:43,970
I don't want to go to the same people
and be like I guess I'm taking the taxi

4370
01:41:43,970 --> 01:41:43,980
and be like I guess I'm taking the taxi
 

4371
01:41:43,980 --> 01:41:46,129
and be like I guess I'm taking the taxi
after all

4372
01:41:46,129 --> 01:41:46,139
after all
 

4373
01:41:46,139 --> 01:41:48,109
after all
but I was hoping that it would already

4374
01:41:48,109 --> 01:41:48,119
but I was hoping that it would already
 

4375
01:41:48,119 --> 01:41:49,669
but I was hoping that it would already
be different people but it was really

4376
01:41:49,669 --> 01:41:49,679
be different people but it was really
 

4377
01:41:49,679 --> 01:41:52,430
be different people but it was really
early in the morning like four or five

4378
01:41:52,430 --> 01:41:52,440
early in the morning like four or five
 

4379
01:41:52,440 --> 01:41:54,890
early in the morning like four or five
a.m so there was no way that so many

4380
01:41:54,890 --> 01:41:54,900
a.m so there was no way that so many
 

4381
01:41:54,900 --> 01:41:57,050
a.m so there was no way that so many
people would be taking taxes so I walk

4382
01:41:57,050 --> 01:41:57,060
people would be taking taxes so I walk
 

4383
01:41:57,060 --> 01:42:00,350
people would be taking taxes so I walk
back it's like literally a walk of shame

4384
01:42:00,350 --> 01:42:00,360
back it's like literally a walk of shame
 

4385
01:42:00,360 --> 01:42:03,490
back it's like literally a walk of shame
for me

4386
01:42:03,490 --> 01:42:03,500

 

4387
01:42:03,500 --> 01:42:07,609

and I'm like I I get I guess I'm taking

4388
01:42:07,609 --> 01:42:07,619
and I'm like I I get I guess I'm taking
 

4389
01:42:07,619 --> 01:42:10,070

6117
02:29:28,380 --> 02:29:32,690
do it let's do it why is it so short
took me 12 hours yeah I mean I heard

6118
02:29:32,690 --> 02:29:32,700
took me 12 hours yeah I mean I heard
 

6119
02:29:32,700 --> 02:29:34,190
took me 12 hours yeah I mean I heard
also that it sounds so difficult because

6120
02:29:34,190 --> 02:29:34,200
also that it sounds so difficult because
 

6121
02:29:34,200 --> 02:29:35,750
also that it sounds so difficult because
it locks

6122
02:29:35,750 --> 02:29:35,760
it locks
 

6123
02:29:35,760 --> 02:29:38,510
it locks
it might be FPS but it locks there it's

6124
02:29:38,510 --> 02:29:38,520
it might be FPS but it locks there it's
 

6125
02:29:38,520 --> 02:29:40,309
it might be FPS but it locks there it's
like there's like a lock function so

6126
02:29:40,309 --> 02:29:40,319
like there's like a lock function so
 

6127
02:29:40,319 --> 02:29:43,070
like there's like a lock function so
it's not difficult to hit

6128
02:29:43,070 --> 02:29:43,080
it's not difficult to hit
 

6129
02:29:43,080 --> 02:29:44,929
it's not difficult to hit
so I might not struggle that much with

6130
02:29:44,929 --> 02:29:44,939
so I might not struggle that much with
 

6131
02:29:44,939 --> 02:29:48,950
so I might not struggle that much with
it right

6132

6199
02:31:40,160 --> 02:31:42,230

now on the next you know public stream

6200
02:31:42,230 --> 02:31:42,240
now on the next you know public stream
 

6201
02:31:42,240 --> 02:31:46,010
now on the next you know public stream
right in when is her next public stream

6202
02:31:46,010 --> 02:31:46,020
right in when is her next public stream
 

6203
02:31:46,020 --> 02:31:48,710
right in when is her next public stream
when is it what will it be

6204
02:31:48,710 --> 02:31:48,720
when is it what will it be
 

6205
02:31:48,720 --> 02:31:50,870
when is it what will it be
and will she even let me in is the

6206
02:31:50,870 --> 02:31:50,880
and will she even let me in is the
 

6207
02:31:50,880 --> 02:31:52,429
and will she even let me in is the
question because if she doesn't expect

6208
02:31:52,429 --> 02:31:52,439
question because if she doesn't expect
 

6209
02:31:52,439 --> 02:31:54,670
question because if she doesn't expect
it then she probably also didn't clean

6210
02:31:54,670 --> 02:31:54,680
it then she probably also didn't clean
 

6211
02:31:54,680 --> 02:31:56,990
it then she probably also didn't clean
her room

6212
02:31:56,990 --> 02:31:57,000
her room
 

6213
02:31:57,000 --> 02:32:01,370
her room
so I don't know if she will let me in we

6214
02:32:01,370 --> 02:32:01,380
so I don't know if she will let me in we
 

6215
02:32:01,380 --> 02:32:03,410
so I don't know if she will let me in we
can apply pressure

6216
02:32:03,410 --> 02:32:03,420
can apply pressure
 

6217
02:32:03,420 --> 02:32:06,900
can apply pressure
on her

6218
02:32:06,900 --> 02:32:06,910

9031
03:41:40,380 --> 03:41:41,929
I chose a size too small and in the

03:41:41,929 --> 03:41:41,939
beginning it didn't bother me too much I
 

9033
03:41:41,939 --> 03:41:43,849
beginning it didn't bother me too much I
was like I guess that's a bit tight but

9034
03:41:43,849 --> 03:41:43,859
was like I guess that's a bit tight but
 

9035
03:41:43,859 --> 03:41:46,269
was like I guess that's a bit tight but
it will give me grip so that's okay

9036
03:41:46,269 --> 03:41:46,279
it will give me grip so that's okay
 

9037
03:41:46,279 --> 03:41:48,769
it will give me grip so that's okay
but after dancing

9038
03:41:48,769 --> 03:41:48,779
but after dancing
 

9039
03:41:48,779 --> 03:41:50,269
but after dancing
a lot

9040
03:41:50,269 --> 03:41:50,279
a lot
 

9041
03:41:50,279 --> 03:41:51,830
a lot
more and more

9042
03:41:51,830 --> 03:41:51,840
more and more
 

9043
03:41:51,840 --> 03:41:54,830
more and more
it felt more and more painful

9044
03:41:54,830 --> 03:41:54,840
it felt more and more painful
 

9045
03:41:54,840 --> 03:41:56,090
it felt more and more painful
um

9046
03:41:56,090 --> 03:41:56,100
um
 

9047
03:41:56,100 --> 03:41:59,929
um

03:42:03,469 --> 03:42:03,479
they said ideally not because then maybe
 

9051
03:42:03,479 --> 03:42:05,510
they said ideally not because then maybe
we have some you know calibration issues

9052
03:42:05,510 --> 03:42:05,520
we have some you know calibration issues
 

9053
03:42:05,520 --> 03:42:06,889

this and that

9054

this and that
 

9055

this and that
so you're already calibrated with this

9056
03:42:08,450 --> 03:42:08,460
so you're already calibrated with this
 

9057
03:42:08,460 --> 03:42:09,950
so you're already calibrated with this

9063
03:42:15,000 --> 03:42:18,530

I insisted on it and it was fine it was
fine no problem with calibration but

9066
03:42:21,650 --> 03:42:21,660

prefer to change on our own

9168
03:44:58,910 --> 03:44:58,920
prefer to change on our own
 

9169
03:44:58,920 --> 03:45:02,450
prefer to change on our own
actually because

9170
03:45:02,450 --> 03:45:02,460

 

9171
03:45:02,460 --> 03:45:05,210

do like stuff with 3D but I just don't
 

10329

um
 

10433
04:14:13,920 --> 04:14:15,950
um
stage because we could we can only have

10434
04:14:15,950 --> 04:14:15,960
stage because we could we can only have
 

10435
04:14:15,960 --> 04:14:17,330
stage because we could we can only have
one stage

10436
04:14:17,330 --> 04:14:17,340
one stage
 

10437
04:14:17,340 --> 04:14:19,429
one stage
for ourselves

10438
04:14:19,429 --> 04:14:19,439
for ourselves
 

10439
04:14:19,439 --> 04:14:22,670
for ourselves
uh that they would make for us

10440
04:14:22,670 --> 04:14:22,680
uh that they would make for us
 

10441
04:14:22,680 --> 04:14:24,769
uh that they would make for us
unless I mean I just found out about

10442
04:14:24,769 --> 04:14:24,779
unless I mean I just found out about
 

10443
04:14:24,779 --> 04:14:26,450
unless I mean I just found out about
this today so I'm just gonna correct

10444
04:14:26,450 --> 04:14:26,460
this today so I'm just gonna correct
 

10445
04:14:26,460 --> 04:14:28,070
this today so I'm just gonna correct
myself because no we don't want

10446
04:14:28,070 --> 04:14:28,080
myself because no we don't want
 

10447
04:14:28,080 --> 04:14:30,950
myself because no we don't want
misunderstandings but in the case like

10448
04:14:30,950 --> 04:14:30,960
misunderstandings but in the case like
 

10449
04:14:30,960 --> 04:14:33,170
misunderstandings but in the case like
gouda apparently it was okay to have two

10450
04:14:33,170 --> 04:14:33,180
gouda apparently it was okay to have two
 

10451
04:14:33,180 --> 04:14:36,889
gouda apparently it was okay to have two
because uh one of them was simple both

10452
04:14:36,889 --> 04:14:36,899
because uh one of them was simple both
 

10453
04:14:36,899 --> 04:14:38,809
because uh one of them was simple both
of them were apparently simple enough to

10454
04:14:38,809 --> 04:14:38,819
of them were apparently simple enough to
 

10455
04:14:38,819 --> 04:14:40,910
of them were apparently simple enough to
have two

10456
04:14:40,910 --> 04:14:40,920
have two
 

10457
04:14:40,920 --> 04:14:43,010
have two
um but I as far as I know I could only

10458
04:14:43,010 --> 04:14:43,020
um but I as far as I know I could only
 

10459
04:14:43,020 --> 04:14:45,769
um but I as far as I know I could only
have two at one so I I wanted it to be

10460
04:14:45,769 --> 04:14:45,779
have two at one so I I wanted it to be
 

10461
04:14:45,779 --> 04:14:48,290
have two at one so I I wanted it to be
somewhat versatile

10462
04:14:48,290 --> 04:14:48,300
somewhat versatile
 

10463
04:14:48,300 --> 04:14:53,389
somewhat versatile
so I wanted it to have a function where

10464
04:14:53,389 --> 04:14:53,399
so I wanted it to have a function where
 

10465
04:14:53,399 --> 04:14:56,450
so I wanted it to have a function where
it could be used as a performance stage

10466
04:14:56,450 --> 04:14:56,460
it could be used as a performance stage
 

10467
04:14:56,460 --> 04:14:58,610
it could be used as a performance stage
I don't think I'll use it again in the

10468
04:14:58,610 --> 04:14:58,620
I don't think I'll use it again in the
 

10469
04:14:58,620 --> 04:15:00,590
I don't think I'll use it again in the
future but if I if I do

10470
04:15:00,590 --> 04:15:00,600
future but if I if I do
 

10471
04:15:00,600 --> 04:15:01,729
future but if I if I do
um

10472
04:15:01,729 --> 04:15:01,739
um
 

10473
04:15:01,739 --> 04:15:04,550
um
I mean but it's almost a waste no use

10474
04:15:04,550 --> 04:15:04,560
I mean but it's almost a waste no use
 

10475
04:15:04,560 --> 04:15:06,170
I mean but it's almost a waste no use
this game but I most of the time I don't

10476
04:15:06,170 --> 04:15:06,180
this game but I most of the time I don't
 

10477
04:15:06,180 --> 04:15:09,410
this game but I most of the time I don't
really see these kind of stages not

10478
04:15:09,410 --> 04:15:09,420
really see these kind of stages not
 

10479
04:15:09,420 --> 04:15:13,070
really see these kind of stages not
stages like rooms being reused a lot

10480
04:15:13,070 --> 04:15:13,080
stages like rooms being reused a lot
 

10481
04:15:13,080 --> 04:15:16,070
stages like rooms being reused a lot
most of them are not that's like

10482
04:15:16,070 --> 04:15:16,080
most of them are not that's like
 

10483
04:15:16,080 --> 04:15:22,130
most of them are not that's like
reusable

10484

10485
04:15:22,140 --> 04:15:24,370

most of them don't seem that reusable

10486
04:15:24,370 --> 04:15:24,380
most of them don't seem that reusable
 

10487
04:15:24,380 --> 04:15:26,750
most of them don't seem that reusable
stuff like that on an energy stage for

10488
04:15:26,750 --> 04:15:26,760
stuff like that on an energy stage for
 

10489
04:15:26,760 --> 04:15:29,510
stuff like that on an energy stage for
example is super reusable for anybody

10490
04:15:29,510 --> 04:15:29,520
example is super reusable for anybody
 

10491
04:15:29,520 --> 04:15:31,910
example is super reusable for anybody
by the way the place I performed Sparks

10492
04:15:31,910 --> 04:15:31,920
by the way the place I performed Sparks
 

10493
04:15:31,920 --> 04:15:34,090
by the way the place I performed Sparks
in was

10494
04:15:34,090 --> 04:15:34,100
in was
 

10495
04:15:34,100 --> 04:15:37,550
in was
Matsuri Senpai stage

10496
04:15:37,550 --> 04:15:37,560
Matsuri Senpai stage
 

10497
04:15:37,560 --> 04:15:39,469
Matsuri Senpai stage
that I have

10498
04:15:39,469 --> 04:15:39,479
that I have
 

10499
04:15:39,479 --> 04:15:43,670
that I have
not seen being used in a long long time

10500
04:15:43,670 --> 04:15:43,680
not seen being used in a long long time
 

10501
04:15:43,680 --> 04:15:45,170
not seen being used in a long long time
I think

10502
04:15:45,170 --> 04:15:45,180
I think
 

10503
04:15:45,180 --> 04:15:47,210
I think
yeah

10504
04:15:47,210 --> 04:15:47,220
yeah
 

10505
04:15:47,220 --> 04:15:48,490
yeah
yeah

10506
04:15:48,490 --> 04:15:48,500
yeah
 

10507
04:15:48,500 --> 04:15:53,030
yeah
but like for example for my birthday I I

10508
04:15:53,030 --> 04:15:53,040
but like for example for my birthday I I
 

10509
04:15:53,040 --> 04:15:56,090
but like for example for my birthday I I
I don't know if I would use it again

10510
04:15:56,090 --> 04:15:56,100
I don't know if I would use it again
 

10511
04:15:56,100 --> 04:15:57,410
I don't know if I would use it again
um

10512
04:15:57,410 --> 04:15:57,420
um
 

10513
04:15:57,420 --> 04:16:00,590
um
but as far as I know

10514
04:16:00,590 --> 04:16:00,600
but as far as I know
 

10515
04:16:00,600 --> 04:16:03,950
but as far as I know
uh for birthday concerts I think they

10516
04:16:03,950 --> 04:16:03,960
uh for birthday concerts I think they
 

10517
04:16:03,960 --> 04:16:06,550
uh for birthday concerts I think they
like from what I've seen in Japanese

10518
04:16:06,550 --> 04:16:06,560
like from what I've seen in Japanese
 

10519
04:16:06,560 --> 04:16:09,769
like from what I've seen in Japanese
birthday concerts

10520
04:16:09,769 --> 04:16:09,779
birthday concerts
 

10521
04:16:09,779 --> 04:16:12,290
birthday concerts
they arrange

10522
04:16:12,290 --> 04:16:12,300
they arrange
 

10523
04:16:12,300 --> 04:16:14,469
they arrange
the stage

10524
04:16:14,469 --> 04:16:14,479
the stage
 

10525
04:16:14,479 --> 04:16:17,090
the stage
uh once per year for these kind of

10526
04:16:17,090 --> 04:16:17,100
uh once per year for these kind of
 

10527
04:16:17,100 --> 04:16:20,450
uh once per year for these kind of
occasions they arrange it uh like the

10528
04:16:20,450 --> 04:16:20,460
occasions they arrange it uh like the
 

10529
04:16:20,460 --> 04:16:22,429
occasions they arrange it uh like the
general use stage they arrange it for

10530
04:16:22,429 --> 04:16:22,439
general use stage they arrange it for
 

10531
04:16:22,439 --> 04:16:23,809
general use stage they arrange it for
you

10532
04:16:23,809 --> 04:16:23,819
you
 

10533
04:16:23,819 --> 04:16:26,570
you
according to the theme that you want

10534
04:16:26,570 --> 04:16:26,580
according to the theme that you want
 

10535
04:16:26,580 --> 04:16:27,769
according to the theme that you want
yeah

10536
04:16:27,769 --> 04:16:27,779
yeah
 

10537
04:16:27,779 --> 04:16:29,929
yeah
so maybe that's what will happen with

10538
04:16:29,929 --> 04:16:29,939
so maybe that's what will happen with
 

10539
04:16:29,939 --> 04:16:31,550
so maybe that's what will happen with
the Eon stage because it didn't happen

10540
04:16:31,550 --> 04:16:31,560
the Eon stage because it didn't happen
 

10541
04:16:31,560 --> 04:16:33,769
the Eon stage because it didn't happen
this time it was not

10542
04:16:33,769 --> 04:16:33,779
this time it was not
 

10543
04:16:33,779 --> 04:16:36,110
this time it was not
arranged according to

10544
04:16:36,110 --> 04:16:36,120
arranged according to
 

10545
04:16:36,120 --> 04:16:45,650
arranged according to
us it was just like left the way it is

10546
04:16:45,650 --> 04:16:45,660

 

10547
04:16:45,660 --> 04:16:49,550

I used the dedicated em stage

10548
04:16:49,550 --> 04:16:49,560
I used the dedicated em stage
 

10549
04:16:49,560 --> 04:16:51,469
I used the dedicated em stage
the whole live English stage the new one

10550
04:16:51,469 --> 04:16:51,479
the whole live English stage the new one
 

10551
04:16:51,479 --> 04:16:53,210
the whole live English stage the new one
I used it

10552
04:16:53,210 --> 04:16:53,220
I used it
 

10553
04:16:53,220 --> 04:16:54,469
I used it
and

10554
04:16:54,469 --> 04:16:54,479
and
 

10555
04:16:54,479 --> 04:16:56,450
and
you know used it that Kelly used it

10556
04:16:56,450 --> 04:16:56,460
you know used it that Kelly used it
 

10557
04:16:56,460 --> 04:16:58,610
you know used it that Kelly used it
kelly didn't use it did she

10558
04:16:58,610 --> 04:16:58,620
kelly didn't use it did she
 

10559
04:16:58,620 --> 04:17:00,290
kelly didn't use it did she
hold it

10560
04:17:00,290 --> 04:17:00,300
hold it
 

10561
04:17:00,300 --> 04:17:05,870
hold it
good I also didn't use it

10562
04:17:05,870 --> 04:17:05,880

 

10563
04:17:05,880 --> 04:17:08,809

this is kfb you can have skits yeah but

10564
04:17:08,809 --> 04:17:08,819
this is kfb you can have skits yeah but
 

10565
04:17:08,819 --> 04:17:10,490
this is kfb you can have skits yeah but
like most of these things they're like

10566
04:17:10,490 --> 04:17:10,500
like most of these things they're like
 

10567
04:17:10,500 --> 04:17:12,349
like most of these things they're like
you make them for the Showcase and then

10568
04:17:12,349 --> 04:17:12,359
you make them for the Showcase and then
 

10569
04:17:12,359 --> 04:17:13,790
you make them for the Showcase and then
you don't really

10570
04:17:13,790 --> 04:17:13,800
you don't really
 

10571
04:17:13,800 --> 04:17:18,429
you don't really
use it again which seems really wasteful

10572
04:17:18,429 --> 04:17:18,439

 

10573
04:17:18,439 --> 04:17:20,630

especially when I don't have access to

10574
04:17:20,630 --> 04:17:20,640
especially when I don't have access to
 

10575
04:17:20,640 --> 04:17:24,290
especially when I don't have access to
3D I asked if they will let me use the

10576
04:17:24,290 --> 04:17:24,300
3D I asked if they will let me use the
 

10577
04:17:24,300 --> 04:17:27,889
3D I asked if they will let me use the
kfb background in home 3D because there

10578
04:17:27,889 --> 04:17:27,899
kfb background in home 3D because there
 

10579
04:17:27,899 --> 04:17:29,150
kfb background in home 3D because there
are some backgrounds right like the

10580
04:17:29,150 --> 04:17:29,160
are some backgrounds right like the
 

10581
04:17:29,160 --> 04:17:30,650
are some backgrounds right like the
Christmasy background and the beach

10582
04:17:30,650 --> 04:17:30,660
Christmasy background and the beach
 

10583
04:17:30,660 --> 04:17:32,510
Christmasy background and the beach
background and so on

10584
04:17:32,510 --> 04:17:32,520
background and so on
 

10585
04:17:32,520 --> 04:17:35,990
background and so on
and I was told no

10586
04:17:35,990 --> 04:17:36,000
and I was told no
 

10587
04:17:36,000 --> 04:17:38,870
and I was told no
maybe in the Far Far Future but

10588
04:17:38,870 --> 04:17:38,880
maybe in the Far Far Future but
 

10589
04:17:38,880 --> 04:17:40,910
maybe in the Far Far Future but
no

10590
04:17:40,910 --> 04:17:40,920
no
 

10591
04:17:40,920 --> 04:17:42,650
no
I guess it's like something like with

10592
04:17:42,650 --> 04:17:42,660
I guess it's like something like with
 

10593
04:17:42,660 --> 04:17:49,070
I guess it's like something like with
importing it is difficult

10594
04:17:49,070 --> 04:17:49,080

 

10595
04:17:49,080 --> 04:17:52,070

so I can't even like that would I would

10596
04:17:52,070 --> 04:17:52,080
so I can't even like that would I would
 

10597
04:17:52,080 --> 04:17:57,290
so I can't even like that would I would
use it as a stream background

10598
04:17:57,290 --> 04:17:57,300

 

10599
04:17:57,300 --> 04:17:59,389

and then I could like change it every

10600
04:17:59,389 --> 04:17:59,399
and then I could like change it every
 

10601
04:17:59,399 --> 04:18:00,950
and then I could like change it every
time because there's so many angles I

10602
04:18:00,950 --> 04:18:00,960
time because there's so many angles I
 

10603
04:18:00,960 --> 04:18:02,809
time because there's so many angles I
could use

10604
04:18:02,809 --> 04:18:02,819
could use
 

10605
04:18:02,819 --> 04:18:04,429
could use
um

10606
04:18:04,429 --> 04:18:04,439
um
 

10607
04:18:04,439 --> 04:18:06,349
um
I would totally love to use that stage

10608
04:18:06,349 --> 04:18:06,359
I would totally love to use that stage
 

10609
04:18:06,359 --> 04:18:07,670
I would totally love to use that stage
on my stream

10610
04:18:07,670 --> 04:18:07,680
on my stream
 

10611
04:18:07,680 --> 04:18:09,410
on my stream
maybe they'll change their mind who

10612
04:18:09,410 --> 04:18:09,420
maybe they'll change their mind who
 

10613
04:18:09,420 --> 04:18:10,309
maybe they'll change their mind who
knows

10614
04:18:10,309 --> 04:18:10,319
knows
 

10615
04:18:10,319 --> 04:18:13,130
knows
great loading screens all right those

10616
04:18:13,130 --> 04:18:13,140
great loading screens all right those
 

10617
04:18:13,140 --> 04:18:15,910
great loading screens all right those
were all my idea

10618
04:18:15,910 --> 04:18:15,920
were all my idea
 

10619
04:18:15,920 --> 04:18:18,349
were all my idea
I was messing around with those I like

10620
04:18:18,349 --> 04:18:18,359
I was messing around with those I like
 

10621
04:18:18,359 --> 04:18:23,150
I was messing around with those I like
them so much

10622
04:18:23,150 --> 04:18:23,160

 

10623
04:18:23,160 --> 04:18:26,030

[Music]

10624
04:18:26,030 --> 04:18:26,040
[Music]
 

10625
04:18:26,040 --> 04:18:28,550
[Music]
I mean maybe if they don't

10626
04:18:28,550 --> 04:18:28,560
I mean maybe if they don't
 

10627
04:18:28,560 --> 04:18:30,650
I mean maybe if they don't
maybe I can

10628
04:18:30,650 --> 04:18:30,660
maybe I can
 

10629
04:18:30,660 --> 04:18:32,689
maybe I can
if they send me the file and I get some

10630
04:18:32,689 --> 04:18:32,699
if they send me the file and I get some
 

10631
04:18:32,699 --> 04:18:35,150
if they send me the file and I get some
like 3D program maybe I can at least

10632
04:18:35,150 --> 04:18:35,160
like 3D program maybe I can at least
 

10633
04:18:35,160 --> 04:18:38,090
like 3D program maybe I can at least
even if I can't use it within our

10634
04:18:38,090 --> 04:18:38,100
even if I can't use it within our
 

10635
04:18:38,100 --> 04:18:40,309
even if I can't use it within our
program you know and move it around live

10636
04:18:40,309 --> 04:18:40,319
program you know and move it around live
 

10637
04:18:40,319 --> 04:18:42,650
program you know and move it around live
maybe I can just render some

10638
04:18:42,650 --> 04:18:42,660
maybe I can just render some
 

10639
04:18:42,660 --> 04:18:45,650
maybe I can just render some
like basically screenshots

10640
04:18:45,650 --> 04:18:45,660
like basically screenshots
 

10641
04:18:45,660 --> 04:18:47,030
like basically screenshots
you know what I mean

10642
04:18:47,030 --> 04:18:47,040
you know what I mean
 

10643
04:18:47,040 --> 04:18:51,050
you know what I mean
and use them as backgrounds

10644
04:18:51,050 --> 04:18:51,060

 

10645
04:18:51,060 --> 04:18:53,510

I won't be able to like move around in

10646
04:18:53,510 --> 04:18:53,520
I won't be able to like move around in
 

10647
04:18:53,520 --> 04:18:54,710
I won't be able to like move around in
them

10648
04:18:54,710 --> 04:18:54,720
them
 

10649
04:18:54,720 --> 04:18:58,510
them
but

10650
