battle arenas are getting more and more
 

11719
05:13:14,798 --> 05:13:16,150
battle arenas are getting more and more
difficult because the first time it was

11720
05:13:16,150 --> 05:13:16,160
difficult because the first time it was
 

11721
05:13:16,160 --> 05:13:17,430
difficult because the first time it was
so easy because you could just run

11722
05:13:17,430 --> 05:13:17,440
so easy because you could just run
 

11723
05:13:17,440 --> 05:13:18,868
so easy because you could just run
around the tree and

11724
05:13:18,868 --> 05:13:18,878
around the tree and
 

11725
05:13:18,878 --> 05:13:21,190
around the tree and
he would always bonk against the tree

11726
05:13:21,190 --> 05:13:21,200
he would always bonk against the tree
 

11727
05:13:21,200 --> 05:13:23,270
he would always bonk against the tree
and then in the in the uh in the one

11728
05:13:23,270 --> 05:13:23,280
and then in the in the uh in the one
 

11729
05:13:23,280 --> 05:13:25,350
and then in the in the uh in the one
that we had uh at the beginning of

11730
05:13:25,350 --> 05:13:25,360
that we had uh at the beginning of
 

11731
05:13:25,360 --> 05:13:27,830
that we had uh at the beginning of
today's stream

11732
05:13:27,830 --> 05:13:27,840
today's stream
 

11733
05:13:27,840 --> 05:13:29,990
today's stream
it was like there was no place to hide

11734
05:13:29,990 --> 05:13:30,000
it was like there was no place to hide
 

11735
05:13:30,000 --> 05:13:32,550
it was like there was no place to hide
but it was at least a pretty big and

11736
05:13:32,550 --> 05:13:32,560
but it was at least a pretty big and
 

11737
05:13:32,560 --> 05:13:34,550
but it was at least a pretty big and
round simple flat

11738
05:13:34,550 --> 05:13:34,560
round simple flat
 

11739
05:13:34,560 --> 05:13:35,590
round simple flat
arena

11740
05:13:35,590 --> 05:13:35,600
arena
 

11741
05:13:35,600 --> 05:13:38,310
arena
and then for this one

11742
05:13:38,310 --> 05:13:38,320
and then for this one
 

11743
05:13:38,320 --> 05:13:39,830
and then for this one
there's uh

11744
05:13:39,830 --> 05:13:39,840
there's uh
 

11745
05:13:39,840 --> 05:13:41,830
there's uh
barely any space to move around and it's

11746
05:13:41,830 --> 05:13:41,840
barely any space to move around and it's
 

11747
05:13:41,840 --> 05:13:44,310
barely any space to move around and it's
very uneven um

11748
05:13:44,310 --> 05:13:44,320
very uneven um
 

11749
05:13:44,320 --> 05:13:47,350
very uneven um
because there's so much lava in between

11750
05:13:47,350 --> 05:13:47,360
because there's so much lava in between
 

11751
