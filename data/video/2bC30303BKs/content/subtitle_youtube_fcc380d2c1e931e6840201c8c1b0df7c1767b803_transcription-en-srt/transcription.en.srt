normally cannot really super chat and
 

4973
02:17:55,599 --> 02:17:56,389
normally cannot really super chat and
therefore

4974
02:17:56,389 --> 02:17:56,399
therefore
 

4975
02:17:56,399 --> 02:17:58,230

02:18:02,230 --> 02:18:02,240
message in the chat but it's just
 

4981
02:18:02,240 --> 02:18:05,910
message in the chat but it's just
too many messages if i only had like

4982
02:18:05,910 --> 02:18:05,920
too many messages if i only had like
 

4983
02:18:05,920 --> 02:18:07,990
too many messages if i only had like
what 50 viewers or something like that i
