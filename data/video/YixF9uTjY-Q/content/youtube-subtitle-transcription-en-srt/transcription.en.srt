counter that with maybe 3 000 takodachis

13614
05:58:01,670 --> 05:58:01,680
counter that with maybe 3 000 takodachis
 

13615
05:58:01,680 --> 05:58:04,150
counter that with maybe 3 000 takodachis
but they will not know that we basically

13616
05:58:04,150 --> 05:58:04,160
but they will not know that we basically
 

13617
05:58:04,160 --> 05:58:05,510
but they will not know that we basically
count double

13618
05:58:05,510 --> 05:58:05,520
count double
 

13619
05:58:05,520 --> 05:58:06,548
count double
because

13620
05:58:06,548 --> 05:58:06,558
