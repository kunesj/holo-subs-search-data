although my Game of Thrones is like kind

7418
03:26:02,090 --> 03:26:02,100
although my Game of Thrones is like kind
 

7419
03:26:02,100 --> 03:26:04,070
although my Game of Thrones is like kind
of medieval too it's like just more open

7420
03:26:04,070 --> 03:26:04,080
of medieval too it's like just more open
 

7421
03:26:04,080 --> 03:26:05,510
of medieval too it's like just more open
more fantasy but they're kind of

7422
03:26:05,510 --> 03:26:05,520
more fantasy but they're kind of
 

7423
03:26:05,520 --> 03:26:07,670
more fantasy but they're kind of
medieval too

7424
03:26:07,670 --> 03:26:07,680
medieval too
 

7425
03:26:07,680 --> 03:26:12,010

but she had the Majestic Aura and and

7426
03:26:12,010 --> 03:26:12,020
but she had the Majestic Aura and and
 

7427
03:26:12,020 --> 03:26:17,269
but she had the Majestic Aura and and
man she I thought that this is not the

7428
03:26:17,269 --> 03:26:17,279
man she I thought that this is not the
 

7429
03:26:17,279 --> 03:26:19,429
man she I thought that this is not the
fact that I didn't recognize her is not

7430
03:26:19,429 --> 03:26:19,439
fact that I didn't recognize her is not
 

7431
03:26:19,439 --> 03:26:21,349
fact that I didn't recognize her is not
only due to

7432
03:26:21,349 --> 03:26:21,359
only due to
 

7433
03:26:21,359 --> 03:26:23,870
only due to
um her looks being different because

7434
03:26:23,870 --> 03:26:23,880
um her looks being different because
 

7435
03:26:23,880 --> 03:26:25,370
um her looks being different because
they're not that different

7436
03:26:25,370 --> 03:26:25,380
they're not that different
 

7437
03:26:25,380 --> 03:26:27,349

I think it's more because her acting is

7438
03:26:27,349 --> 03:26:27,359
I think it's more because her acting is
 

7439
03:26:27,359 --> 03:26:29,030
I think it's more because her acting is
so good

7440
03:26:29,030 --> 03:26:29,040
so good
 

7441
03:26:29,040 --> 03:26:31,969

12283
05:34:48,360 --> 05:34:49,670
need art and that takes some time so I
don't want to do it in February though

12284
05:34:49,670 --> 05:34:49,680
don't want to do it in February though
 

12285
05:34:49,680 --> 05:34:52,070
don't want to do it in February though
because in February the thing with Ahmed

12286
05:34:52,070 --> 05:34:52,080
because in February the thing with Ahmed
 

12287
05:34:52,080 --> 05:34:53,930
because in February the thing with Ahmed
will be happening and I don't want two

12288
05:34:53,930 --> 05:34:53,940
will be happening and I don't want two
 

12289
05:34:53,940 --> 05:34:56,330
will be happening and I don't want two
things in one month you know I try to

12290
05:34:56,330 --> 05:34:56,340
things in one month you know I try to
 

12291
05:34:56,340 --> 05:34:58,548
things in one month you know I try to
spread it out at least to have a month

12292
05:34:58,548 --> 05:34:58,558
spread it out at least to have a month
 

12293
05:34:58,558 --> 05:35:00,230
spread it out at least to have a month
in between

12294
05:35:00,230 --> 05:35:00,240
in between
 

12295
05:35:00,240 --> 05:35:03,770
in between
so it probably will have to wait until

12296
05:35:03,770 --> 05:35:03,780
so it probably will have to wait until
 

12297
05:35:03,780 --> 05:35:05,930
so it probably will have to wait until
March even though I'm like really into
