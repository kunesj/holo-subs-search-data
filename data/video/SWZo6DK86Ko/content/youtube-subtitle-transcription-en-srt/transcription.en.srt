if i record

1408
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:06,400
if i record
 

1409
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,550
if i record
my dances in

1410
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:08,560
my dances in
 

1411
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,470
my dances in
the whole japan studio i think

1412
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:12,480
the whole japan studio i think
 

1413
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,069
the whole japan studio i think
i think uh

1414
00:35:14,069 --> 00:35:14,079
i think uh
 

1415
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,510
i think uh
it might be

1416
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:15,520
it might be
 

1417
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,870
it might be
more

1418
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:16,880
more
 

1419
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:22,950
more
true to the real deal

1420
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:22,960

 

1421
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,190

yeah um

1422
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:25,200
yeah um
 

1423
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,190
yeah um
a lot of them

1424
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:27,200
a lot of them
 

1425
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,270
a lot of them
uh

1426
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:29,280
uh
 

1427
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,190
uh
tracking was

1428
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:31,200
tracking was
 

1429
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,470
tracking was
like for example for a heart challenger

1430
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:34,480
like for example for a heart challenger
 

1431
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,109
like for example for a heart challenger
there's like this movement where i move

there's like this movement where i move
my arms really really fast like uh

about but like fast movements like that
 

1447
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,390
about but like fast movements like that
uh would often

1448
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:56,400
uh would often
 

1449
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,510
uh would often
like

1450
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:57,520
like
 

1451
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,950
like

00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:08,710
we actually tried our best to smooth

bit

1468
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:16,560
bit
 

1469
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,710
bit
now

1470
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:18,720
now
 

1471
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,829
now
um

1472
00:36:19,829 --> 00:36:19,839
um
 

1473
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:20,710
um
like

1474
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:20,720
like
 

1475
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,829
like

00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:28,240
all of that in one day but there's like
 

1481
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,750
all of that in one day but there's like
uh

1482
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:29,760
uh
 

1483
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,550
uh
you know you you you could think that oh

1484
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:32,560
you know you you you could think that oh
 

1485
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,150
you know you you you could think that oh
then maybe it only took one hour because

1486
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:34,160
then maybe it only took one hour because
 

1487
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,069
then maybe it only took one hour because
the concert was one hour

1488
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:36,079
the concert was one hour
 

1489
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,430
the concert was one hour
but

1490
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:37,440
but
 

1491
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,069
but
it was like approximately maybe 40 to 50

1492
00:36:40,069 --> 00:36:40,079
it was like approximately maybe 40 to 50
 

1493
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:41,430
it was like approximately maybe 40 to 50
minutes

1494
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:41,440
minutes
 

1495
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,270
minutes
for one song

1496
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:43,280
for one song
 

1497
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,710
for one song
because

1498
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:44,720
because
 

1499
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,109
because
there was so much recalibrating in

1500
00:36:47,109 --> 00:36:47,119
there was so much recalibrating in
 

1501
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:48,470
there was so much recalibrating in
between

1502
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:48,480
between
 

1503
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,430
between
and

1504
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:49,440
and
 

1505
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,510
and
kind of had to

1506
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:51,520
kind of had to
 

1507
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,109
kind of had to
split the songs into several parts as

1508
00:36:55,109 --> 00:36:55,119
split the songs into several parts as
 

1509
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,230
split the songs into several parts as
well

1510
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:56,240
well
 

1511
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,589
well
um

1512
00:36:57,589 --> 00:36:57,599
um
 

1513
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:58,950
um
because

1514
00:36:58,950 --> 00:36:58,960
because
 

1515
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,150
because
we even needed to recalibrate in between

1516
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:02,160
we even needed to recalibrate in between
 

1517
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,670
we even needed to recalibrate in between
just to make sure and sometimes you know

1518
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:05,680
just to make sure and sometimes you know
 

1519
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,510
just to make sure and sometimes you know
when i would move around i would go a

1520
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:07,520
when i would move around i would go a
 

1521
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,230
when i would move around i would go a
little bit out of the

1522
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:10,240
little bit out of the
 

1523
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,069
little bit out of the
out of the area that would capture me

1524
00:37:12,069 --> 00:37:12,079
out of the area that would capture me
 

1525
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,710
out of the area that would capture me
perfectly because if i go too close to

1526
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:14,720
perfectly because if i go too close to
 

1527
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,829
perfectly because if i go too close to
you know the

1528
00:37:15,829 --> 00:37:15,839
you know the
 

1529
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:17,030
you know the
edges

1530
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:17,040
edges
 

1531
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,270
edges
uh it would kind of mess up my limbs and

1532
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:19,280
uh it would kind of mess up my limbs and
 

1533
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,270
uh it would kind of mess up my limbs and
all that

1534
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:21,280
all that
 

1535
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,190
all that
so one song

1536
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:23,200
so one song
 

1537
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,550
so one song
would take

1538
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:24,560
would take
 

1539
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,750
would take
about 40 to 50 minutes

1540
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:27,760
about 40 to 50 minutes
 

1541
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,589
about 40 to 50 minutes
now that means like i was dancing indeed

1542
00:37:31,589 --> 00:37:31,599
now that means like i was dancing indeed
 

1543
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:36,150
now that means like i was dancing indeed
for around nine to ten hours

1544
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:36,160
for around nine to ten hours
 

1545
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,109
for around nine to ten hours
yeah and and even even on that day we

1546
00:37:39,109 --> 00:37:39,119
yeah and and even even on that day we
 

1547
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,109
yeah and and even even on that day we
were still figuring things out like in

1548
00:37:41,109 --> 00:37:41,119
were still figuring things out like in
 

1549
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:43,349
were still figuring things out like in
the beginning we had this

1550
00:37:43,349 --> 00:37:43,359
the beginning we had this
 

1551
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:48,710
the beginning we had this
um see-through plastic mat uh

1552
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:48,720
um see-through plastic mat uh
 

1553
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,630
um see-through plastic mat uh
on the on the ground to make it easier

1554
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:50,640
on the on the ground to make it easier
 

1555
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,790
on the on the ground to make it easier
for me to dance

1556
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:52,800
for me to dance
 

1557
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,630
for me to dance
which was really helpful and then we

1558
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:54,640
which was really helpful and then we
 

1559
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,030
which was really helpful and then we
recorded one or two songs of that but

1560
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:57,040
recorded one or two songs of that but
 

1561
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,109
recorded one or two songs of that but
then we realized

1562
00:37:59,109 --> 00:37:59,119
then we realized
 

1563
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,349
then we realized
holy [\h__\h] this thing

1564
00:38:01,349 --> 00:38:01,359
holy [\h__\h] this thing
 

1565
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,670
holy [\h__\h] this thing
which does not look

1566
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:03,680
which does not look
 

1567
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,829
which does not look
like it's reflecting anything actually

1568
00:38:05,829 --> 00:38:05,839
like it's reflecting anything actually
 

1569
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:08,630
like it's reflecting anything actually
did apparently reflect things

1570
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:08,640
did apparently reflect things
 

1571
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,829
did apparently reflect things
really [\h__\h] sensitive man

1572
00:38:11,829 --> 00:38:11,839
really [\h__\h] sensitive man
 

1573
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:12,630
really [\h__\h] sensitive man
so

1574
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:12,640
so
 

1575
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,190
so
we had to get rid of that and then we

1576
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:15,200
we had to get rid of that and then we
 

1577
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,910
we had to get rid of that and then we
re-recorded those songs again later i

1578
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:17,920
re-recorded those songs again later i

00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:35,760
we captured
 

1643
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,030
we captured
the hand move where we tried we tried to

1644
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:39,040
the hand move where we tried we tried to
 

1645
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:44,150
the hand move where we tried we tried to
capture the hand movement separately

03:55:01,510 --> 03:55:01,520

 

9287
03:55:01,520 --> 03:55:03,750

no i'm just assuming that i don't know

9288
03:55:03,750 --> 03:55:03,760
no i'm just assuming that i don't know
 

9289
03:55:03,760 --> 03:55:05,990
no i'm just assuming that i don't know
id japan

9290
03:55:05,990 --> 03:55:06,000
id japan
 

9291
03:55:06,000 --> 03:55:08,710
id japan
maybe and i don't know one year later

9292
03:55:08,710 --> 03:55:08,720
maybe and i don't know one year later
 

9293
03:55:08,720 --> 03:55:11,269
maybe and i don't know one year later
you would assume that probably

9294
03:55:11,269 --> 03:55:11,279
you would assume that probably
 

9295
03:55:11,279 --> 03:55:18,070
you would assume that probably
it might be growth i don't know anything

9296
03:55:18,070 --> 03:55:18,080

 

9297
03:55:18,080 --> 03:55:20,630

it's just if you look at the past of the

9298
03:55:20,630 --> 03:55:20,640
it's just if you look at the past of the
 

9299
03:55:20,640 --> 03:55:22,950
it's just if you look at the past of the
whole life so far every year we've

9300
03:55:22,950 --> 03:55:22,960
whole life so far every year we've
 

9301
03:55:22,960 --> 03:55:28,870
whole life so far every year we've
gained members so it just makes sense

9302
03:55:28,870 --> 03:55:28,880

 

9303
03:55:28,880 --> 03:55:31,269

do two parts like louie ah but that in

9304
03:55:31,269 --> 03:55:31,279
do two parts like louie ah but that in
 

9305
03:55:31,279 --> 03:55:33,349
do two parts like louie ah but that in

9306
03:55:33,349 --> 03:55:33,359
the end also just makes it longer if you
 

9307
03:55:33,359 --> 03:55:34,870
the end also just makes it longer if you
have if it's so long that you have to

9308
03:55:34,870 --> 03:55:34,880
have if it's so long that you have to
 

9309
03:55:34,880 --> 03:55:36,950
have if it's so long that you have to
split it into two groups

9310
03:55:36,950 --> 03:55:36,960
split it into two groups
 

9311
03:55:36,960 --> 03:55:38,790
split it into two groups
two streams

9312
03:55:38,790 --> 03:55:38,800
