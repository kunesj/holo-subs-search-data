yeah it ended up being a little RP but

15742
07:04:30,750 --> 07:04:30,760
yeah it ended up being a little RP but
 

15743

of
 

15809
07:06:36,760 --> 07:06:39,350
of
thing but the for this one this one it

15810
07:06:39,350 --> 07:06:39,360
thing but the for this one this one it
 

15811
07:06:39,360 --> 07:06:41,590
thing but the for this one this one it
was definitely a uh was this one was

15812
07:06:41,590 --> 07:06:41,600
was definitely a uh was this one was
 

15813
07:06:41,600 --> 07:06:44,310
was definitely a uh was this one was
definitely a I felt responsibility to

15814
07:06:44,310 --> 07:06:44,320
definitely a I felt responsibility to
 

15815
07:06:44,320 --> 07:06:47,670
definitely a I felt responsibility to
keep up

15816
07:06:47,670 --> 07:06:47,680

 

15817
07:06:47,680 --> 07:06:50,750

with um the progression I guess this

15818
07:06:50,750 --> 07:06:50,760
with um the progression I guess this
 

15819
07:06:50,760 --> 07:06:52,948
with um the progression I guess this
this one this one was definitely I like

15820
07:06:52,948 --> 07:06:52,958
this one this one was definitely I like
 

15821
07:06:52,958 --> 07:06:56,910
this one this one was definitely I like
I felt I felt like the responsibility of

15822
07:06:56,910 --> 07:06:56,920
I felt I felt like the responsibility of
 

15823
07:06:56,920 --> 07:06:59,708
I felt I felt like the responsibility of
keeping up cuz if you don't play every

15824
07:06:59,708 --> 07:06:59,718
keeping up cuz if you don't play every
 

15825
07:06:59,718 --> 07:07:02,070
keeping up cuz if you don't play every
day you fall behind a little little bit

15826
07:07:02,070 --> 07:07:02,080
day you fall behind a little little bit
 

15827
07:07:02,080 --> 07:07:08,270
day you fall behind a little little bit
progression wise

15828
07:07:08,270 --> 07:07:08,280

 

15829
07:07:08,280 --> 07:07:11,150

yeah I feel like I feel like maybe if we

15830
07:07:11,150 --> 07:07:11,160
yeah I feel like I feel like maybe if we
 

15831
07:07:11,160 --> 07:07:13,548
yeah I feel like I feel like maybe if we
do a season

15832
07:07:13,548 --> 07:07:13,558
do a season
 

15833
07:07:13,558 --> 07:07:16,750
do a season
2 um we should do it where it's not s

15834
07:07:16,750 --> 07:07:16,760
2 um we should do it where it's not s
 

15835
07:07:16,760 --> 07:07:18,868
2 um we should do it where it's not s
days in a row and maybe like a couple of

15836
07:07:18,868 --> 07:07:18,878
days in a row and maybe like a couple of
 

15837
07:07:18,878 --> 07:07:20,430
days in a row and maybe like a couple of
days and then the next week a couple of

15838
07:07:20,430 --> 07:07:20,440
days and then the next week a couple of
 

15839
07:07:20,440 --> 07:07:22,270
days and then the next week a couple of
days and the next week a couple of days

15840
07:07:22,270 --> 07:07:22,280
days and the next week a couple of days
 

15841
07:07:22,280 --> 07:07:24,830
days and the next week a couple of days
so that way people are more inclined

15842
07:07:24,830 --> 07:07:24,840
so that way people are more inclined
 

15843
07:07:24,840 --> 07:07:28,590
so that way people are more inclined
to like play a couple days in a row and

15844
07:07:28,590 --> 07:07:28,600
to like play a couple days in a row and
 

15845
07:07:28,600 --> 07:07:33,230
to like play a couple days in a row and
then pause and stuff because that way

15846
07:07:33,230 --> 07:07:33,240
then pause and stuff because that way
 

15847
07:07:33,240 --> 07:07:36,110
then pause and stuff because that way
some people like people who can't do

15848
07:07:36,110 --> 07:07:36,120
some people like people who can't do
 

15849
07:07:36,120 --> 07:07:37,708
some people like people who can't do
like all seven days will't fall behind

15850
07:07:37,708 --> 07:07:37,718
like all seven days will't fall behind
 

15851
07:07:37,718 --> 07:07:49,590
like all seven days will't fall behind
as much or something like

15852
07:07:49,590 --> 07:07:49,600

 

15853
07:07:49,600 --> 07:07:52,110

that cuz I think it would be better if

15854
07:07:52,110 --> 07:07:52,120
that cuz I think it would be better if
 

15855
07:07:52,120 --> 07:07:54,190
that cuz I think it would be better if
everybody is

15856
07:07:54,190 --> 07:07:54,200
everybody is
 

15857
07:07:54,200 --> 07:07:58,590
everybody is
like on the same pain maybe like
