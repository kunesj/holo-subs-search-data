11807
05:32:15,180 --> 05:32:18,288

do longer streams like RPGs and so on I

11808

have to start early

11810
05:32:20,830 --> 05:32:20,840
have to start early
 

11811
05:32:20,840 --> 05:32:25,910
have to start early
but I see that in general I have more

11812
05:32:25,910 --> 05:32:25,920
but I see that in general I have more
 

11813
05:32:25,920 --> 05:32:28,970
but I see that in general I have more
viewers if I stream later in the day so

11814
05:32:28,970 --> 05:32:28,980
viewers if I stream later in the day so
 

11815
05:32:28,980 --> 05:32:31,610
viewers if I stream later in the day so
that's why I try to schedule shorter
