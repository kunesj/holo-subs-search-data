a secret

3210
02:23:39,590 --> 02:23:39,600
a secret
 

3211
02:23:39,600 --> 02:23:41,590
a secret
totally because if we if we say it then

3212
02:23:41,590 --> 02:23:41,600
totally because if we if we say it then
 

3213
02:23:41,600 --> 02:23:43,830
totally because if we if we say it then
it won't come true right so yeah exactly
