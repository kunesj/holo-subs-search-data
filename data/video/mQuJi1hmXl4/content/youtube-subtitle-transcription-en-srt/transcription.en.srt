4429
01:59:35,099 --> 01:59:37,490
staying up until three am or even 5 a.m
because it will take a little while

4430
01:59:37,490 --> 01:59:37,500
because it will take a little while
 

4431
01:59:37,500 --> 01:59:40,870
because it will take a little while
just to see

04:24:15,290 --> 04:24:15,300
place and then it failed so I had to
 

9761
04:24:15,300 --> 04:24:16,969
place and then it failed so I had to
re-record it in the studio but it was

9762
04:24:16,969 --> 04:24:16,979
re-record it in the studio but it was
 

9763

04:24:26,090 --> 04:24:26,100
alone and then because I was recording a
 

9769
04:24:26,100 --> 04:24:28,370
alone and then because I was recording a
lot of software that I wasn't so

9799
04:25:00,840 --> 04:25:02,809
there's a small no and then I guess it
was recording in mono but then when I

9800

was recording in mono but then when I
 

9801
04:25:02,819 --> 04:25:04,429
was recording in mono but then when I
was like

9802
04:25:04,429 --> 04:25:04,439

filed I saved them in mono in Stereo but

9808
04:25:13,130 --> 04:25:13,140
filed I saved them in mono in Stereo but
 

9809
04:25:13,140 --> 04:25:17,389
filed I saved them in mono in Stereo but
like in my mind it's it feels like

9810
04:25:17,389 --> 04:25:17,399
like in my mind it's it feels like
 

9811
04:25:17,399 --> 04:25:19,130
like in my mind it's it feels like
yeah that shouldn't be like such a

9812
04:25:19,130 --> 04:25:19,140
yeah that shouldn't be like such a
 

9813
04:25:19,140 --> 04:25:21,530
yeah that shouldn't be like such a
difficult thing like what an impossible

9814
04:25:21,530 --> 04:25:21,540
difficult thing like what an impossible

04:25:25,849 --> 04:25:25,859
especially if it was originally recorded
 

9819
04:25:25,859 --> 04:25:27,530
especially if it was originally recorded
in mono anyway because I imagine that

9820
04:25:27,530 --> 04:25:27,540
in mono anyway because I imagine that
 

9821
04:25:27,540 --> 04:25:29,570
in mono anyway because I imagine that
it's just like a force stereo kind of

9822
04:25:29,570 --> 04:25:29,580
it's just like a force stereo kind of
 

9823
04:25:29,580 --> 04:25:32,450
it's just like a force stereo kind of
thing well I don't know I don't I mean I

hear that because I guess I felt the
 

9961
04:28:25,140 --> 04:28:27,469
hear that because I guess I felt the
same like it's it's nice to record

9962
04:28:27,469 --> 04:28:27,479
same like it's it's nice to record
 

9963
04:28:27,479 --> 04:28:29,510
same like it's it's nice to record
things alone at home

9964
04:28:29,510 --> 04:28:29,520
things alone at home

04:28:29,520 --> 04:28:31,490
things alone at home
at my own pace

9966
04:28:31,490 --> 04:28:31,500
at my own pace
 

9967
04:28:31,500 --> 04:28:33,889
at my own pace
but at the same time it's also nice to

9968
04:28:33,889 --> 04:28:33,899
but at the same time it's also nice to
 

9969
04:28:33,899 --> 04:28:36,710
but at the same time it's also nice to
record with someone there who can tell

9970
04:28:36,710 --> 04:28:36,720
record with someone there who can tell
 

9971
04:28:36,720 --> 04:28:39,830
record with someone there who can tell
me uh this this one's out this take

9972
04:28:39,830 --> 04:28:39,840
me uh this this one's out this take
 

9973
04:28:39,840 --> 04:28:41,090
me uh this this one's out this take
sounded a little bit better than this

9974
04:28:41,090 --> 04:28:41,100
sounded a little bit better than this
 

9975
04:28:41,100 --> 04:28:44,210
sounded a little bit better than this
take or this vowel wasn't pronounced so

9976
04:28:44,210 --> 04:28:44,220
take or this vowel wasn't pronounced so
 

9977
04:28:44,220 --> 04:28:47,149
take or this vowel wasn't pronounced so
clearly so let's redo that and can get

9978
04:28:47,149 --> 04:28:47,159
clearly so let's redo that and can get
 

9979
04:28:47,159 --> 04:28:49,250
clearly so let's redo that and can get
some other people's opinions and it's

9980
04:28:49,250 --> 04:28:49,260
some other people's opinions and it's
 

9981
04:28:49,260 --> 04:28:51,110
some other people's opinions and it's
also easy when someone else just

9982
04:28:51,110 --> 04:28:51,120
also easy when someone else just
 

9983
04:28:51,120 --> 04:28:53,870
also easy when someone else just
controls the program and and they can

9984
04:28:53,870 --> 04:28:53,880
controls the program and and they can
 

9985
04:28:53,880 --> 04:28:56,210
controls the program and and they can
like quickly delete takes make new ones

9986
04:28:56,210 --> 04:28:56,220
like quickly delete takes make new ones
 

9987
04:28:56,220 --> 04:28:59,450

04:47:28,440 --> 04:47:30,550

because

10772
04:47:30,550 --> 04:47:30,560
because
 

10773
04:47:30,560 --> 04:47:34,910

them both up at once I mean you can you

10798
04:48:06,770 --> 04:48:06,780
them both up at once I mean you can you
 

10799
04:48:06,780 --> 04:48:09,350
them both up at once I mean you can you
can but you can only use one of them at

10800
04:48:09,350 --> 04:48:09,360
can but you can only use one of them at
 

10801
04:48:09,360 --> 04:48:10,490
can but you can only use one of them at
once

10802
04:48:10,490 --> 04:48:10,500
once
 

10803
04:48:10,500 --> 04:48:12,010
once
um

10804
04:48:12,010 --> 04:48:12,020
um
 

10805
04:48:12,020 --> 04:48:14,930
um
if you look up the

10806
04:48:14,930 --> 04:48:14,940
if you look up the
 

10807
04:48:14,940 --> 04:48:17,270
if you look up the
video or so you can see it it has like

10808
04:48:17,270 --> 04:48:17,280
video or so you can see it it has like
 

10809
04:48:17,280 --> 04:48:19,610
video or so you can see it it has like
six trackers I think or so

10810
04:48:19,610 --> 04:48:19,620
six trackers I think or so
 

10811
04:48:19,620 --> 04:48:22,550
six trackers I think or so
and it's not a suit it's like trackers

10812
04:48:22,550 --> 04:48:22,560
and it's not a suit it's like trackers
 

10813
04:48:22,560 --> 04:48:24,770
and it's not a suit it's like trackers
that you attach to what you're wearing I

10814
04:48:24,770 --> 04:48:24,780
that you attach to what you're wearing I
 

10815
04:48:24,780 --> 04:48:26,750
that you attach to what you're wearing I
guess

10816
04:48:26,750 --> 04:48:26,760
guess
 

10817
04:48:26,760 --> 04:48:30,170
guess
um what's what I have is a suit which is

10818
04:48:30,170 --> 04:48:30,180
um what's what I have is a suit which is
 

10819
04:48:30,180 --> 04:48:32,510
um what's what I have is a suit which is
not as good as the suit in the studio

10820
04:48:32,510 --> 04:48:32,520
not as good as the suit in the studio
 

10821
04:48:32,520 --> 04:48:34,788
not as good as the suit in the studio
that for example I recorded my new

10822
04:48:34,788 --> 04:48:34,798
that for example I recorded my new
 

10823
04:48:34,798 --> 04:48:37,670
that for example I recorded my new
YouTube short in

YouTube short in
 

10825
04:48:37,680 --> 04:48:41,448
YouTube short in
um so definitely not on that level

10826
04:48:41,448 --> 04:48:41,458
um so definitely not on that level
 

10827
04:48:41,458 --> 04:48:43,730
um so definitely not on that level
and honestly our suit isn't much better

10828
04:48:43,730 --> 04:48:43,740
and honestly our suit isn't much better
 

10829
04:48:43,740 --> 04:48:46,310
and honestly our suit isn't much better
but I see definitely it's

10830
04:48:46,310 --> 04:48:46,320
but I see definitely it's
 

10831
04:48:46,320 --> 04:48:49,368
but I see definitely it's
somewhat a little bit better than mokopi

10832
04:48:49,368 --> 04:48:49,378
somewhat a little bit better than mokopi
 

10833
04:48:49,378 --> 04:48:51,470
somewhat a little bit better than mokopi
