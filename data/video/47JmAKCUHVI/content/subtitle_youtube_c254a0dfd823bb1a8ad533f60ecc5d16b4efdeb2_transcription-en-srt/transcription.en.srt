the reason i chose to play it
 

95
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,749
the reason i chose to play it
is because i

96
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:21,759
is because i
 

97
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,070
is because i
bought um the creators just simply the

98
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,080
bought um the creators just simply the
 

99
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,469
bought um the creators just simply the
even just by looking at the creators i

100
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:28,479
even just by looking at the creators i
 

101
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,029
even just by looking at the creators i
was like yo i gotta give that a try and

102
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:31,039
was like yo i gotta give that a try and
 

103
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,629

if you guys are also hyped for it then

104
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:32,639
if you guys are also hyped for it then
 

105
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:41,990
if you guys are also hyped for it then
there must be a reason for it

106
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:42,000

 

107
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,830

um i've heard a lot of people say that

108
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:43,840
um i've heard a lot of people say that
 

109
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,390
um i've heard a lot of people say that
it's really difficult

110
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:46,400
it's really difficult
 

111
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,029
it's really difficult
and that you die a lot uh

112
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:49,039
and that you die a lot uh
 

113
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,430
and that you die a lot uh
so i'll probably do a really bad job

114
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:53,440
so i'll probably do a really bad job
 

115
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,589
so i'll probably do a really bad job
but we start off with a character

116
00:07:55,589 --> 00:07:55,599
but we start off with a character
 

117
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,350
but we start off with a character
creation apparently

118
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:57,360
creation apparently
 

119
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,869
creation apparently
so that's good

120
00:07:58,869 --> 00:07:58,879
so that's good
 

121
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,749
so that's good
um some warming up time i guess and also

122
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:01,759
um some warming up time i guess and also
 

123
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,150
um some warming up time i guess and also
some time to charge my controller uh

124
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:04,160
some time to charge my controller uh
 

125
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,350
some time to charge my controller uh
it's currently

126
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:05,360
it's currently
 

127
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,710
it's currently
on the wire

128
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:06,720
on the wire
 

129
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,629
on the wire
but yeah and let's i guess start with

130
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:08,639
but yeah and let's i guess start with
 

131
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,309
but yeah and let's i guess start with
that because that's probably gonna take

132
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:10,319
that because that's probably gonna take
 

133
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,390
that because that's probably gonna take
some time uh do you guys hear the bgm

10710
04:57:44,230 --> 04:57:44,240
it on another one or
 

10711
04:57:44,240 --> 04:57:48,708
it on another one or
is it like one time only

10712
04:57:48,708 --> 04:57:48,718

 

10713
04:57:48,718 --> 04:57:52,628

not reusable okay

10714
04:57:52,628 --> 04:57:52,638

 

10715
04:57:52,638 --> 04:57:54,550

so

10716
04:57:54,550 --> 04:57:54,560
so
 

10717
04:57:54,560 --> 04:57:59,110
so
uh

10718
04:57:59,110 --> 04:57:59,120

 

10719
04:57:59,120 --> 04:58:03,110

wait so this is what it is currently

10720
04:58:03,110 --> 04:58:03,120

 

10721
04:58:03,120 --> 04:58:05,190

and that's on both of them

10722
04:58:05,190 --> 04:58:05,200
and that's on both of them
 

10723
04:58:05,200 --> 04:58:07,670
and that's on both of them
on all of them is that the main basic

10724
