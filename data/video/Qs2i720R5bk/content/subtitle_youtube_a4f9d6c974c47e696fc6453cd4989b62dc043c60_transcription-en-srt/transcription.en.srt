yeah the time zone juggling I was

3640
01:44:26,270 --> 01:44:26,280
yeah the time zone juggling I was
 

3641
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:27,890
yeah the time zone juggling I was
difficult

3642
01:44:27,890 --> 01:44:27,900
difficult
 

3643
01:44:27,900 --> 01:44:31,310
difficult
but I mean we could rotate that

3644
01:44:31,310 --> 01:44:31,320
but I mean we could rotate that
 

3645
01:44:31,320 --> 01:44:35,870
but I mean we could rotate that
every time this group plays together

02:51:04,190 --> 02:51:04,200
so
 

5819
02:51:04,200 --> 02:51:08,650

we can make a plane

5820
02:51:08,650 --> 02:51:08,660

um
 

9125
04:28:41,520 --> 04:28:45,889
um
I only have a donut weapon

9126
04:28:45,889 --> 04:28:45,899

 

9127
04:28:45,899 --> 04:28:49,130

I'll have to

9128
04:28:49,130 --> 04:28:49,140
I'll have to
 

9129
04:28:49,140 --> 04:28:51,170
I'll have to
fuse it with something else

9130
04:28:51,170 --> 04:28:51,180
fuse it with something else
 

9131
04:28:51,180 --> 04:28:53,689
fuse it with something else
uh

9132
04:28:53,689 --> 04:28:53,699
uh
 

9133
04:28:53,699 --> 04:28:55,790
uh
um I guess this thing

9134
04:28:55,790 --> 04:28:55,800
um I guess this thing
 

9135
04:28:55,800 --> 04:29:01,070
um I guess this thing
oh that was just a number one core

9136
04:29:01,070 --> 04:29:01,080

 

9137
04:29:01,080 --> 04:29:08,689

okay

9138
04:29:08,689 --> 04:29:08,699

 

9139
04:29:08,699 --> 04:29:12,469

this one's turning

9140
04:29:12,469 --> 04:29:12,479

 

9141
04:29:12,479 --> 04:29:16,429

can you

9142
04:29:16,429 --> 04:29:16,439

 

9143
04:29:16,439 --> 04:29:18,349

um

9144
04:29:18,349 --> 04:29:18,359
um
 

9145
04:29:18,359 --> 04:29:20,689
um
what is that

9146
04:29:20,689 --> 04:29:20,699
what is that
 

9147
04:29:20,699 --> 04:29:23,809
what is that
hmm

9148
04:29:23,809 --> 04:29:23,819

 

9149
04:29:23,819 --> 04:29:27,110

Flintstones

04:29:27,110 --> 04:29:27,120

 

9151
04:29:27,120 --> 04:29:29,929

oh

9152

oh

9156
04:29:41,990 --> 04:29:42,000

 

9157
04:29:42,000 --> 04:29:48,010

is it because they're turned on

9158
04:29:48,010 --> 04:29:48,020

 

9159
04:29:48,020 --> 04:29:49,809

what

9160
04:29:49,809 --> 04:29:49,819
what
 

9161
04:29:49,819 --> 04:29:53,510
what
a what

9162
04:29:53,510 --> 04:29:53,520

 

9163
04:29:53,520 --> 04:29:55,370

four hours

9164
04:29:55,370 --> 04:29:55,380
four hours
 

9165
04:29:55,380 --> 04:29:57,649
four hours
four and a half hours very comfortable

9166
04:29:57,649 --> 04:29:57,659
four and a half hours very comfortable
 

9167
04:29:57,659 --> 04:30:00,710
four and a half hours very comfortable
hours

9168
04:30:00,710 --> 04:30:00,720

 

9169
04:30:00,720 --> 04:30:02,149

huh

9170
04:30:02,149 --> 04:30:02,159
huh
 

9171
04:30:02,159 --> 04:30:03,170
huh
like

9172
04:30:03,170 --> 04:30:03,180
like
 

9173
04:30:03,180 --> 04:30:05,750
like
what

9174
04:30:05,750 --> 04:30:05,760

 

9175
04:30:05,760 --> 04:30:09,170

what can I

9176
04:30:09,170 --> 04:30:09,180

 

9177
04:30:09,180 --> 04:30:13,849

well let me go over there first anyway

9178
04:30:13,849 --> 04:30:13,859

 

9179
04:30:13,859 --> 04:30:19,309

but no I was far I was right to under it

9180
04:30:19,309 --> 04:30:19,319

 

9181
04:30:19,319 --> 04:30:24,229

what about this one this one works okay

9182
04:30:24,229 --> 04:30:24,239

 

9183
04:30:24,239 --> 04:30:30,050

um this one already has a rocket on it

9184
04:30:30,050 --> 04:30:30,060

 

9185
04:30:30,060 --> 04:30:32,090

and some other tools

9186
04:30:32,090 --> 04:30:32,100
and some other tools
 

9187
04:30:32,100 --> 04:30:34,670
and some other tools
oh I want to make oh since there's so

9188
04:30:34,670 --> 04:30:34,680
oh I want to make oh since there's so
 

9189
04:30:34,680 --> 04:30:37,729
oh I want to make oh since there's so
many Rockets here or do I need them

9190
04:30:37,729 --> 04:30:37,739
many Rockets here or do I need them
 

9191
04:30:37,739 --> 04:30:41,030
many Rockets here or do I need them
all

9192
04:30:41,030 --> 04:30:41,040

 

9193
04:30:41,040 --> 04:30:44,450

I wanna make some rocket Shields I never

9194
04:30:44,450 --> 04:30:44,460
I wanna make some rocket Shields I never
 

9195
04:30:44,460 --> 04:30:46,969
I wanna make some rocket Shields I never
did that before really

9196
04:30:46,969 --> 04:30:46,979
did that before really
 

9197
04:30:46,979 --> 04:30:52,070
did that before really
but it's just so efficient

9198
04:30:52,070 --> 04:30:52,080

 

9199
04:30:52,080 --> 04:30:53,990

and they probably work even better with

9200
04:30:53,990 --> 04:30:54,000
and they probably work even better with
 

9201
04:30:54,000 --> 04:30:57,070
and they probably work even better with
donut Shields

9202
04:30:57,070 --> 04:30:57,080

 

9203
04:30:57,080 --> 04:31:01,860

I won't need all of them okay good

9204
04:31:01,860 --> 04:31:01,870

 

9205
04:31:01,870 --> 04:31:12,670

[Music]

9206
04:31:12,670 --> 04:31:12,680

 

9207
04:31:12,680 --> 04:31:15,229

what's up here

9208
04:31:15,229 --> 04:31:15,239
what's up here
 

9209
04:31:15,239 --> 04:31:17,469
what's up here
one rocket but if you fuse it like this

9210
04:31:17,469 --> 04:31:17,479
one rocket but if you fuse it like this
 

9211
04:31:17,479 --> 04:31:20,570
one rocket but if you fuse it like this
does that even

9212
04:31:20,570 --> 04:31:20,580
does that even
 

9213
04:31:20,580 --> 04:31:26,330
does that even
work

9214
04:31:26,330 --> 04:31:26,340

 

9215
04:31:26,340 --> 04:31:28,370

don't they break off when when they're

9216
04:31:28,370 --> 04:31:28,380
don't they break off when when they're
 

9217
04:31:28,380 --> 04:31:29,389
don't they break off when when they're
like

9218
04:31:29,389 --> 04:31:29,399
like
 

9219
04:31:29,399 --> 04:31:32,389
like
power

9220
04:31:32,389 --> 04:31:32,399

 

9221
04:31:32,399 --> 04:31:34,610

when they're

9222
04:31:34,610 --> 04:31:34,620
when they're
 

9223
04:31:34,620 --> 04:31:38,630
when they're
has no free

9224
04:31:38,630 --> 04:31:38,640

 

9225
04:31:38,640 --> 04:31:43,309

um space you know

9226
04:31:43,309 --> 04:31:43,319

 

9227
04:31:43,319 --> 04:31:46,610

anyway I guess we're using this one

9228
04:31:46,610 --> 04:31:46,620
anyway I guess we're using this one
 

9229
04:31:46,620 --> 04:31:49,550
anyway I guess we're using this one
why I don't know it's so far away why am

9230
04:31:49,550 --> 04:31:49,560
why I don't know it's so far away why am
 

9231
04:31:49,560 --> 04:31:51,469
why I don't know it's so far away why am
I doing this

9232
04:31:51,469 --> 04:31:51,479
I doing this
 

9233
04:31:51,479 --> 04:31:53,389
I doing this
why am I doing this

9234
04:31:53,389 --> 04:31:53,399
why am I doing this
 

9235
04:31:53,399 --> 04:31:55,370
why am I doing this
and how many do we need

9236
04:31:55,370 --> 04:31:55,380
and how many do we need
 

9237
04:31:55,380 --> 04:31:56,510
and how many do we need
um

9238
04:31:56,510 --> 04:31:56,520
um
 

9239
04:31:56,520 --> 04:31:58,189
um
okay we might need a bunch more though

9240
04:31:58,189 --> 04:31:58,199
okay we might need a bunch more though
 

9241
04:31:58,199 --> 04:32:01,550
okay we might need a bunch more though
yeah yeah yeah a bunch more

9242
04:32:01,550 --> 04:32:01,560
yeah yeah yeah a bunch more
 

9243
04:32:01,560 --> 04:32:05,210
yeah yeah yeah a bunch more
and then a steering wheel I think will

9244
04:32:05,210 --> 04:32:05,220
and then a steering wheel I think will
 

9245
04:32:05,220 --> 04:32:07,610
and then a steering wheel I think will
give us that luxury

9246
04:32:07,610 --> 04:32:07,620
give us that luxury
 

9247
04:32:07,620 --> 04:32:10,389
give us that luxury
right

9248
04:32:10,389 --> 04:32:10,399

 

9249
04:32:10,399 --> 04:32:15,530

angle the Rockets

9250
04:32:15,530 --> 04:32:15,540

 

9251
04:32:15,540 --> 04:32:18,889

I guess I could do that too but steering

9252
04:32:18,889 --> 04:32:18,899
I guess I could do that too but steering
 

9253
04:32:18,899 --> 04:32:22,729
I guess I could do that too but steering
wheel will make things easier

9254
04:32:22,729 --> 04:32:22,739

 

9255
04:32:22,739 --> 04:32:25,550

no

9256
04:32:25,550 --> 04:32:25,560

 

9257
04:32:25,560 --> 04:32:28,670

you don't think it makes a difference

9258
04:32:28,670 --> 04:32:28,680
you don't think it makes a difference
 

9259
04:32:28,680 --> 04:32:30,649
you don't think it makes a difference
maybe instead of more Rockets just more

9260
04:32:30,649 --> 04:32:30,659
maybe instead of more Rockets just more
 

9261
04:32:30,659 --> 04:32:33,469
maybe instead of more Rockets just more
batteries nah although but not with

9262
04:32:33,469 --> 04:32:33,479
batteries nah although but not with
 

9263
04:32:33,479 --> 04:32:36,410
batteries nah although but not with
rockets they just really fall off

9264
04:32:36,410 --> 04:32:36,420
rockets they just really fall off
 

9265
04:32:36,420 --> 04:32:40,610
rockets they just really fall off
after a certain dunno

9266
04:32:40,610 --> 04:32:40,620

 

9267
04:32:40,620 --> 04:32:47,570

you'd use angled pockets

9268
04:32:47,570 --> 04:32:47,580

 

9269
04:32:47,580 --> 04:32:55,670

he wow a space program

9270
04:32:55,670 --> 04:32:55,680

 

9271
04:32:55,680 --> 04:32:58,070

yeah I guess I can leave them oh God

9272
04:32:58,070 --> 04:32:58,080
yeah I guess I can leave them oh God
 

9273
04:32:58,080 --> 04:32:59,389
yeah I guess I can leave them oh God
damn it

9274
04:32:59,389 --> 04:32:59,399
damn it
 

9275
04:32:59,399 --> 04:33:02,330
damn it
on the platform on the touch yeah that's

9276
04:33:02,330 --> 04:33:02,340
on the platform on the touch yeah that's
 

9277
04:33:02,340 --> 04:33:03,590
on the platform on the touch yeah that's
probably the smartest thing to do then

9278
04:33:03,590 --> 04:33:03,600
probably the smartest thing to do then
 

9279
04:33:03,600 --> 04:33:06,170
probably the smartest thing to do then
you can also just have better control

9280
04:33:06,170 --> 04:33:06,180
you can also just have better control
 

9281
04:33:06,180 --> 04:33:07,910
you can also just have better control
over

9282
04:33:07,910 --> 04:33:07,920
over
 

9283
04:33:07,920 --> 04:33:09,830
over
how

9284
04:33:09,830 --> 04:33:09,840
how
 

9285
04:33:09,840 --> 04:33:19,689
how
far you're going

9286
04:33:19,689 --> 04:33:19,699

 

9287
04:33:19,699 --> 04:33:36,650

yeah okay

9288
04:33:36,650 --> 04:33:36,660

 

9289
04:33:36,660 --> 04:33:39,470

okay then let me uh fix this a little

9290
04:33:39,470 --> 04:33:39,480
okay then let me uh fix this a little
 

9291
04:33:39,480 --> 04:33:40,189
okay then let me uh fix this a little
bit

9292
04:33:40,189 --> 04:33:40,199
bit
 

9293
04:33:40,199 --> 04:33:49,429
bit
um

9294

so we should build can we combine a
glider with a hot air balloon

15734
08:03:45,888 --> 08:03:45,898
glider with a hot air balloon
 

15735
08:03:45,898 --> 08:03:51,708
glider with a hot air balloon
or do we put fans on the hot air balloon

15736
08:03:51,708 --> 08:03:51,718

 

15737
08:03:51,718 --> 08:03:54,468

oh my God it's eight hours

15738
08:03:54,468 --> 08:03:54,478
oh my God it's eight hours
 

15739
08:03:54,478 --> 08:03:56,810
oh my God it's eight hours
what am I doing first of all

15740
08:03:56,810 --> 08:03:56,820
what am I doing first of all
 

15741
08:03:56,820 --> 08:04:00,548
what am I doing first of all
oh

15742
08:04:00,548 --> 08:04:00,558

 

15743
08:04:00,558 --> 08:04:04,670

yeah I think we got all the parts huh

15744
08:04:04,670 --> 08:04:04,680
yeah I think we got all the parts huh
 

15745
08:04:04,680 --> 08:04:06,468
yeah I think we got all the parts huh
don't know that

15746
08:04:06,468 --> 08:04:06,478
don't know that
 

15747
08:04:06,478 --> 08:04:08,510
don't know that
fans won't lift but it will push okay

15748
08:04:08,510 --> 08:04:08,520
fans won't lift but it will push okay
 

15749
08:04:08,520 --> 08:04:10,670
fans won't lift but it will push okay
and that's what I want anyway so we can

15750
08:04:10,670 --> 08:04:10,680
and that's what I want anyway so we can
 

15751
08:04:10,680 --> 08:04:12,770
and that's what I want anyway so we can
hide

15752
08:04:12,770 --> 08:04:12,780
hide
 

15753
08:04:12,780 --> 08:04:17,510
hide
oh if you attach and

15754
08:04:17,510 --> 08:04:17,520
oh if you attach and
 

15755
08:04:17,520 --> 08:04:19,628
oh if you attach and
steering wheel

15756
08:04:19,628 --> 08:04:19,638
steering wheel
 

15757
08:04:19,638 --> 08:04:26,750
steering wheel
can I steer it

15758
08:04:26,750 --> 08:04:26,760

 

15759
08:04:26,760 --> 08:04:28,490

also this goes

15760
08:04:28,490 --> 08:04:28,500
also this goes
 

15761
08:04:28,500 --> 08:04:30,650
also this goes
that way right if I place the fans like

15762
08:04:30,650 --> 08:04:30,660
that way right if I place the fans like
 

15763
08:04:30,660 --> 08:04:32,750
that way right if I place the fans like
this

15764
08:04:32,750 --> 08:04:32,760
this
 

15765
08:04:32,760 --> 08:04:35,690
this
it goes front right

15766
08:04:35,690 --> 08:04:35,700
it goes front right
 

15767
08:04:35,700 --> 08:04:37,310
it goes front right
never tried we're probably there's not

15768
08:04:37,310 --> 08:04:37,320
never tried we're probably there's not
 

15769
08:04:37,320 --> 08:04:40,070
never tried we're probably there's not
even like really actually space still so

15770
08:04:40,070 --> 08:04:40,080
even like really actually space still so
 

15771
08:04:40,080 --> 08:04:41,388
even like really actually space still so
maybe I won't

15772
08:04:41,388 --> 08:04:41,398
maybe I won't
 

15773
08:04:41,398 --> 08:04:43,070
maybe I won't
we'll just try to go in the right

15774
08:04:43,070 --> 08:04:43,080
we'll just try to go in the right
 

15775
08:04:43,080 --> 08:04:44,930
we'll just try to go in the right
direction by starting it off in the

15776
08:04:44,930 --> 08:04:44,940
direction by starting it off in the
 

15777
08:04:44,940 --> 08:04:46,448
direction by starting it off in the
right direction

15778
08:04:46,448 --> 08:04:46,458
right direction
 

15779
08:04:46,458 --> 08:04:48,190
right direction
okay okay

15780
08:04:48,190 --> 08:04:48,200
okay okay
 

15781
08:04:48,200 --> 08:04:51,230
okay okay
so we should be rising

15782
08:04:51,230 --> 08:04:51,240
so we should be rising
 

15783
08:04:51,240 --> 08:05:00,770
so we should be rising
and gliding wait

15784
08:05:00,770 --> 08:05:00,780

 

15785
08:05:00,780 --> 08:05:03,350

however

15786
08:05:03,350 --> 08:05:03,360
however
 

15787
08:05:03,360 --> 08:05:05,930
however
wait these things maybe I should set the

15788
08:05:05,930 --> 08:05:05,940
wait these things maybe I should set the
 

15789
08:05:05,940 --> 08:05:08,570
wait these things maybe I should set the
hot air balloon on top of one of these

15790
08:05:08,570 --> 08:05:08,580
hot air balloon on top of one of these
 

15791
08:05:08,580 --> 08:05:11,510
hot air balloon on top of one of these
because if it stops it will stay in

15792
08:05:11,510 --> 08:05:11,520
because if it stops it will stay in
 

15793
08:05:11,520 --> 08:05:16,368
because if it stops it will stay in
place right

15794
08:05:16,368 --> 08:05:16,378

 

15795
08:05:16,378 --> 08:05:23,448

I I hope

15796
08:05:23,448 --> 08:05:23,458

 

15797
08:05:23,458 --> 08:05:28,128

and how about

15798
08:05:28,128 --> 08:05:28,138

 

15799
08:05:28,138 --> 08:05:37,670

we add battery

15800
08:05:37,670 --> 08:05:37,680

 

15801
08:05:37,680 --> 08:05:39,230

it won't because it will stop floating

15802
08:05:39,230 --> 08:05:39,240
it won't because it will stop floating
 

15803
08:05:39,240 --> 08:05:40,788
it won't because it will stop floating
when you run out of the battery

15804
08:05:40,788 --> 08:05:40,798
when you run out of the battery
 

15805
08:05:40,798 --> 08:05:43,150
when you run out of the battery
oh okay

15806
08:05:43,150 --> 08:05:43,160
oh okay
 

15807
08:05:43,160 --> 08:05:46,910
oh okay
so these are not quite like the the big

15808
08:05:46,910 --> 08:05:46,920
so these are not quite like the the big
 

15809
08:05:46,920 --> 08:05:50,208
so these are not quite like the the big
Bros

15810
08:05:50,208 --> 08:05:50,218

 

15811
08:05:50,218 --> 08:05:54,410

there's like a bigger version of them

15812
08:05:54,410 --> 08:05:54,420

 

15813
08:05:54,420 --> 08:05:56,990

okay I'll attach one more battery we'll

15814
08:05:56,990 --> 08:05:57,000
okay I'll attach one more battery we'll
 

15815
08:05:57,000 --> 08:05:59,330
okay I'll attach one more battery we'll
see how far we get I mean it's not that

15816
08:05:59,330 --> 08:05:59,340
see how far we get I mean it's not that
 

15817
08:05:59,340 --> 08:06:01,850
see how far we get I mean it's not that
far away anymore

15818
08:06:01,850 --> 08:06:01,860
far away anymore
 

15819
08:06:01,860 --> 08:06:03,948
far away anymore
we just need some Heights and the hot

15820
08:06:03,948 --> 08:06:03,958
we just need some Heights and the hot
 

15821
08:06:03,958 --> 08:06:05,510
we just need some Heights and the hot
air balloon will hopefully slowly give

15822
08:06:05,510 --> 08:06:05,520
air balloon will hopefully slowly give
 

15823
08:06:05,520 --> 08:06:07,610
air balloon will hopefully slowly give
it to us

15824
08:06:07,610 --> 08:06:07,620
it to us
 

15825
08:06:07,620 --> 08:06:10,010
it to us
although now I'm wondering if we uh end

15826
08:06:10,010 --> 08:06:10,020
although now I'm wondering if we uh end
 

15827
08:06:10,020 --> 08:06:12,410
although now I'm wondering if we uh end
up we'll we will like probably end up

15828
08:06:12,410 --> 08:06:12,420
up we'll we will like probably end up
 

15829
08:06:12,420 --> 08:06:13,968
up we'll we will like probably end up
bunking against

15830
08:06:13,968 --> 08:06:13,978
bunking against
 

15831
08:06:13,978 --> 08:06:16,490
bunking against
a big wall again because we get more

15832
08:06:16,490 --> 08:06:16,500
a big wall again because we get more
 

15833
08:06:16,500 --> 08:06:18,888
a big wall again because we get more
distance than we get height because the

15834
08:06:18,888 --> 08:06:18,898
distance than we get height because the
 

15835
08:06:18,898 --> 08:06:21,170
distance than we get height because the
height is so slow

15836
08:06:21,170 --> 08:06:21,180
height is so slow
 

15837
08:06:21,180 --> 08:06:29,930
height is so slow
but oh well

15838
08:06:29,930 --> 08:06:29,940
