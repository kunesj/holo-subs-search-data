just continue playing this character on
my own why that was what I was gonna do

1978
00:58:05,930 --> 00:58:05,940
my own why that was what I was gonna do
 

1979
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:08,930
my own why that was what I was gonna do
sure because I I cannot see us like

1980
00:58:08,930 --> 00:58:08,940
sure because I I cannot see us like
 

1981
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:10,790
sure because I I cannot see us like
finishing the whole game together I

1982
00:58:10,790 --> 00:58:10,800
finishing the whole game together I
 

1983
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:14,510
finishing the whole game together I
doubt that we can make time so often and

1984
00:58:14,510 --> 00:58:14,520
doubt that we can make time so often and
 

1985
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:16,630
doubt that we can make time so often and
yeah

1986
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:16,640
yeah
 

1987
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:19,309
yeah
especially because I want to play

1988
00:58:19,309 --> 00:58:19,319
especially because I want to play
 

1989
00:58:19,319 --> 00:58:21,170
especially because I want to play
a lot of times where not everybody is

1990

a lot of times where not everybody is
 

1991
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:22,849
a lot of times where not everybody is
available so I'll probably beat the game

00:58:22,849 --> 00:58:22,859
available so I'll probably beat the game
 

1993
00:58:22,859 --> 00:58:24,470
