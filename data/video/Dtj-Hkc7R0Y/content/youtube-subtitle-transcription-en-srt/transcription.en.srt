01:20:00,790 --> 01:20:00,800
i've been suspicious about gura was
 

2539
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:03,189
i've been suspicious about gura was
because i kept bumping into her every

2540
01:20:03,189 --> 01:20:03,199
because i kept bumping into her every
 

2541
01:20:03,199 --> 01:20:06,149
because i kept bumping into her every
time uh it was just three of us in total

2542
01:20:06,149 --> 01:20:06,159
time uh it was just three of us in total
 

2543
01:20:06,159 --> 01:20:08,550
time uh it was just three of us in total
so if one person uh left

2544
01:20:08,550 --> 01:20:08,560
so if one person uh left
 

2545
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:10,229
so if one person uh left
it would just be two of us

2546
01:20:10,229 --> 01:20:10,239
it would just be two of us
 

2547
