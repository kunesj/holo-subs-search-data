00:33:45,509 --> 00:33:45,519
consistent I didn't die at all the
 

1069
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:48,430
consistent I didn't die at all the
others did die a couple times because

1070
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:48,440
others did die a couple times because
 

1071
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,470
others did die a couple times because
apparently I didn't think it would be so

1072
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:50,480
apparently I didn't think it would be so
 

1073
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,549
apparently I didn't think it would be so
easy to uh you know shoot someone down

1074
00:33:54,549 --> 00:33:54,559
easy to uh you know shoot someone down
 

1075
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:57,470
easy to uh you know shoot someone down
while they're flying that fast it was

1076
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:57,480
while they're flying that fast it was
 

1077
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,629
while they're flying that fast it was
apparently

1078
00:33:58,629 --> 00:33:58,639
apparently
 

1079
00:33:58,639 --> 00:34:00,830
apparently
quite

1080
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:00,840
quite
 

1081
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,789
quite
manageable that was making me feel

1082
00:34:03,789 --> 00:34:03,799
manageable that was making me feel
 

1083
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:06,750
manageable that was making me feel
pretty uh pressured

1084
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:06,760
pretty uh pressured
 

1085
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:11,109
pretty uh pressured
oh what you I was I was quite under some

1086
00:34:11,109 --> 00:34:11,119
oh what you I was I was quite under some
 

1087
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,389
oh what you I was I was quite under some
pressure but I mean it was decent I got

1088
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:14,399
pressure but I mean it was decent I got
 

1089
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,669
pressure but I mean it was decent I got
what 40

1090
00:34:16,669 --> 00:34:16,679
what 40
 

1091
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:19,030
what 40
points um at least I didn't die that's

1092
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:19,040
points um at least I didn't die that's
 

1093
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,310
points um at least I didn't die that's
like the most important thing and maybe

1094
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:21,320
like the most important thing and maybe
 

1095
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:25,190
like the most important thing and maybe
the only important thing oh

1096
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:25,200
the only important thing oh
 

1097
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,030
the only important thing oh
ah kind of the only important thing

1098
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:28,040
ah kind of the only important thing
 

1099
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,230
ah kind of the only important thing
there because if you die then you get

1100
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:30,240
there because if you die then you get
 

1101
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,109
there because if you die then you get
zero points and that's worse than

1102
00:34:32,109 --> 00:34:32,119
zero points and that's worse than
 

1103
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:34,069
zero points and that's worse than
everything else and I think during the

1104
00:34:34,069 --> 00:34:34,079
everything else and I think during the
 

1105
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,669
everything else and I think during the
actual sports festival there might be a

1106
00:34:36,669 --> 00:34:36,679
actual sports festival there might be a
 

1107
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:39,990
actual sports festival there might be a
few people who are that unlucky to have

1108
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:40,000
few people who are that unlucky to have
 

1109
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,790
few people who are that unlucky to have
an accident like that and I want

1110
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:42,800
an accident like that and I want
 

1111
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,270
an accident like that and I want
to avoid

1112
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:46,280
to avoid
 

1113
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:51,109
to avoid
that so like you can do two TR tries you

1114
00:34:51,109 --> 00:34:51,119
that so like you can do two TR tries you
 

1115
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,190
that so like you can do two TR tries you
can try two times um but if I get a

1116
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:54,200
can try two times um but if I get a
 

1117
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,829
can try two times um but if I get a
decent score the first time I will not

1118
00:34:56,829 --> 00:34:56,839
decent score the first time I will not
 

1119
00:34:56,839 --> 00:34:59,069
decent score the first time I will not
try the second time cuz that's so

1120
00:34:59,069 --> 00:34:59,079
try the second time cuz that's so
 

1121
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:07,570
try the second time cuz that's so
risky right way too

1122
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:07,580

the ideas and in the in that stream and
 

9867
04:41:29,718 --> 04:41:31,628
the ideas and in the in that stream and
she added so much to the map again I

9868
04:41:31,628 --> 04:41:31,638
she added so much to the map again I
 

9869
04:41:31,638 --> 04:41:33,910

added again I don't know where she gets
all those ideas from that map is turning

9874
04:41:39,390 --> 04:41:39,400
all those ideas from that map is turning
 

9875
04:41:39,400 --> 04:41:41,110
all those ideas from that map is turning
into a whole game like you could you

9876
04:41:41,110 --> 04:41:41,120
into a whole game like you could you
 

9877
04:41:41,120 --> 04:41:45,708
into a whole game like you could you
could base a whole game off of that

9878
04:41:45,708 --> 04:41:45,718

 

9879
04:41:45,718 --> 04:41:47,310

map
 

9881
04:41:47,320 --> 04:41:50,868
map
yeah I really thought that the new

9882
04:41:50,868 --> 04:41:50,878
yeah I really thought that the new
 

9883
04:41:50,878 --> 04:41:52,470
yeah I really thought that the new
additional Maps were really really

9884
04:41:52,470 --> 04:41:52,480
additional Maps were really really
 

9885
04:41:52,480 --> 04:41:54,390
additional Maps were really really
pretty very welld

9886
04:41:54,390 --> 04:41:54,400
pretty very welld
 

9887
04:41:54,400 --> 04:41:57,350
pretty very welld

amazing plans to use small vampire K

9894
04:42:06,030 --> 04:42:06,040
amazing plans to use small vampire K
 

9895
04:42:06,040 --> 04:42:08,868
amazing plans to use small vampire K
again oh I mean I guess it would be a

9896
04:42:08,868 --> 04:42:08,878
again oh I mean I guess it would be a
 

9897
04:42:08,878 --> 04:42:13,030
again oh I mean I guess it would be a
waste so even if it's not really

9898
04:42:13,030 --> 04:42:13,040
waste so even if it's not really
 

9899
04:42:13,040 --> 04:42:16,830
waste so even if it's not really
fitting uh sure why

9900
04:42:16,830 --> 04:42:16,840
fitting uh sure why
 

9901
04:42:16,840 --> 04:42:20,948
fitting uh sure why
not via chat is actually dope it is I

9902
04:42:20,948 --> 04:42:20,958
not via chat is actually dope it is I
 

9903
04:42:20,958 --> 04:42:25,590
not via chat is actually dope it is I
see it as a special way for us

9904
04:42:25,590 --> 04:42:25,600
see it as a special way for us
 

9905
04:42:25,600 --> 04:42:28,750
see it as a special way for us
to kind of

9906
04:42:28,750 --> 04:42:28,760
to kind of
 

9907
04:42:28,760 --> 04:42:32,750
to kind of
like satisfy ourselves for the time

9908
04:42:32,750 --> 04:42:32,760
like satisfy ourselves for the time
 

9909
04:42:32,760 --> 04:42:37,470
like satisfy ourselves for the time
being um because I feel like you know if

9910
04:42:37,470 --> 04:42:37,480
being um because I feel like you know if
 

9911
04:42:37,480 --> 04:42:38,910
being um because I feel like you know if
it weren't for the

9912
04:42:38,910 --> 04:42:38,920
it weren't for the
 

9913
04:42:38,920 --> 04:42:41,390
it weren't for the
seing we I don't know who knows maybe

9914
04:42:41,390 --> 04:42:41,400
seing we I don't know who knows maybe
 

9915
04:42:41,400 --> 04:42:44,628
seing we I don't know who knows maybe
maybe we would have gotten 3D already

9916
04:42:44,628 --> 04:42:44,638
maybe we would have gotten 3D already
 

9917
04:42:44,638 --> 04:42:48,868
maybe we would have gotten 3D already
and um also the fact that we can't live

9918
04:42:48,868 --> 04:42:48,878
and um also the fact that we can't live
 

9919
04:42:48,878 --> 04:42:51,830
and um also the fact that we can't live
we can't meet up that easily to do off

9920
04:42:51,830 --> 04:42:51,840
we can't meet up that easily to do off
 

9921
04:42:51,840 --> 04:42:55,590
we can't meet up that easily to do off
collabs so it's kind of like our way to

9922
04:42:55,590 --> 04:42:55,600
collabs so it's kind of like our way to
 

9923
04:42:55,600 --> 04:42:57,708
collabs so it's kind of like our way to
make up for it for ourselves not really

9924
04:42:57,708 --> 04:42:57,718
make up for it for ourselves not really
 

9925
04:42:57,718 --> 04:42:59,150
make up for it for ourselves not really
for the viewers for

9926
04:42:59,150 --> 04:42:59,160
for the viewers for
 

9927
04:42:59,160 --> 04:43:01,750
for the viewers for
ourselves that we can't meet and we

9928
04:43:01,750 --> 04:43:01,760
ourselves that we can't meet and we
 

9929
04:43:01,760 --> 04:43:04,590
ourselves that we can't meet and we
can't just do 3D like that like the

9930
04:43:04,590 --> 04:43:04,600
can't just do 3D like that like the
 

9931
04:43:04,600 --> 04:43:08,590
can't just do 3D like that like the
Japanese members can do it so it's our

9932
04:43:08,590 --> 04:43:08,600
Japanese members can do it so it's our
 

9933
04:43:08,600 --> 04:43:10,110
Japanese members can do it so it's our
special

9934
04:43:10,110 --> 04:43:10,120
special
 

9935
04:43:10,120 --> 04:43:14,550
special
thing and and and yeah for now I think

9936
04:43:14,550 --> 04:43:14,560
thing and and and yeah for now I think
 

9937
04:43:14,560 --> 04:43:16,948
thing and and and yeah for now I think
it's really cool that we have it and it

9938
04:43:16,948 --> 04:43:16,958
it's really cool that we have it and it
 

9939
04:43:16,958 --> 04:43:19,510
it's really cool that we have it and it
it does a good job at making up for it

9940
04:43:19,510 --> 04:43:19,520
it does a good job at making up for it
 

9941
04:43:19,520 --> 04:43:22,990
it does a good job at making up for it
cuz the streams and the clips and the

9942

and I feel like like you know those
 

9951
04:43:32,798 --> 04:43:36,070
and I feel like like you know those
those 3D deut streams in in whole live

9952
04:43:36,070 --> 04:43:36,080
those 3D deut streams in in whole live
 

9953
04:43:36,080 --> 04:43:39,150
those 3D deut streams in in whole live
as much as I love watching those now

9954
04:43:39,150 --> 04:43:39,160
as much as I love watching those now
 

9955
04:43:39,160 --> 04:43:41,670
as much as I love watching those now
that we've done VR chat stuff I I feel

9956
04:43:41,670 --> 04:43:41,680
that we've done VR chat stuff I I feel
 

9957
04:43:41,680 --> 04:43:44,910
that we've done VR chat stuff I I feel
like the VR chat collapse that we've

9958
04:43:44,910 --> 04:43:44,920
like the VR chat collapse that we've
 

9959
04:43:44,920 --> 04:43:49,670
like the VR chat collapse that we've
done so far kind of show our our

9960
04:43:49,670 --> 04:43:49,680
done so far kind of show our our
 

9961
04:43:49,680 --> 04:43:51,670
done so far kind of show our our
derpiness and

9962
04:43:51,670 --> 04:43:51,680
derpiness and
 

9963
04:43:51,680 --> 04:43:56,030
derpiness and
our charm way more than like one of

9964
04:43:56,030 --> 04:43:56,040
our charm way more than like one of
 

9965
04:43:56,040 --> 04:43:58,550
our charm way more than like one of
those 3D streams could ever do cuz those

9966
04:43:58,550 --> 04:43:58,560
those 3D streams could ever do cuz those
 

9967
04:43:58,560 --> 04:44:02,230
those 3D streams could ever do cuz those
are so perfectly organized and

9968
04:44:02,230 --> 04:44:02,240
are so perfectly organized and
 

9969
04:44:02,240 --> 04:44:06,030
are so perfectly organized and
everything must be perfect and and and I

9970
04:44:06,030 --> 04:44:06,040
everything must be perfect and and and I
 

9971
04:44:06,040 --> 04:44:08,910
everything must be perfect and and and I
don't know everything must be planned

9972
04:44:08,910 --> 04:44:08,920
don't know everything must be planned
 

9973
04:44:08,920 --> 04:44:11,390
don't know everything must be planned
and and I don't know it's just it's just

9974
04:44:11,390 --> 04:44:11,400
and and I don't know it's just it's just
 

9975
04:44:11,400 --> 04:44:14,310
and and I don't know it's just it's just
has to be absolutely perfect right so

9976
04:44:14,310 --> 04:44:14,320
has to be absolutely perfect right so
 

9977
04:44:14,320 --> 04:44:16,868
has to be absolutely perfect right so
with the VR chat stuff it's just us

9978
04:44:16,868 --> 04:44:16,878
with the VR chat stuff it's just us
 

9979
04:44:16,878 --> 04:44:19,708
with the VR chat stuff it's just us
derping around having fun doing stupid

9980
04:44:19,708 --> 04:44:19,718
derping around having fun doing stupid
 

9981
04:44:19,718 --> 04:44:23,270
derping around having fun doing stupid
things that we want to do being

9982
04:44:23,270 --> 04:44:23,280
things that we want to do being
 

9983
04:44:23,280 --> 04:44:24,910
things that we want to do being
dorks

9984
04:44:24,910 --> 04:44:24,920
dorks
 

9985
04:44:24,920 --> 04:44:27,628
dorks
and I don't know it's so it it's it's

9986

and I don't know it's so it it's it's
 

9987
04:44:27,638 --> 04:44:31,750
and I don't know it's so it it's it's
probably so much more entertaining

9988
04:44:31,750 --> 04:44:31,760
probably so much more entertaining
 

9989
04:44:31,760 --> 04:44:35,390
probably so much more entertaining
than you know a normal 3D debut stream

9990
04:44:35,390 --> 04:44:35,400
than you know a normal 3D debut stream
 

9991
04:44:35,400 --> 04:44:36,830
than you know a normal 3D debut stream
or whatever could be I mean those are

9992

9995
04:44:39,360 --> 04:44:41,830
always legendary don't get me wrong and
I can't wait to do one of those

9996
04:44:41,830 --> 04:44:41,840
I can't wait to do one of those
 

9997
04:44:41,840 --> 04:44:45,190
I can't wait to do one of those
on my own I love watching those I would

9998
