um the [\h__\h] monkey anymore you would
 

4377
02:03:02,239 --> 02:03:03,830
um the [\h__\h] monkey anymore you would
assume that we can't go through the

02:03:03,830 --> 02:03:03,840
assume that we can't go through the
 

4379
02:03:03,840 --> 02:03:05,390
assume that we can't go through the
tunnel anymore cuz we're scared but

5495
02:34:59,840 --> 02:35:01,910
yeah and the hoodie hoody or parker I
think I called it Parker because I think

5496
02:35:01,910 --> 02:35:01,920
think I called it Parker because I think
 

5497
02:35:01,920 --> 02:35:03,990
think I called it Parker because I think
there's a difference when there's a

5498
02:35:03,990 --> 02:35:04,000
there's a difference when there's a
 

5499
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,070
there's a difference when there's a
zipper I think it's called a Parker but

5500
02:35:06,070 --> 02:35:06,080
zipper I think it's called a Parker but
 

5501
02:35:06,080 --> 02:35:07,590
zipper I think it's called a Parker but
I guess it also depends

5502
02:35:07,590 --> 02:35:07,600
I guess it also depends
 

5503
02:35:07,600 --> 02:35:11,269
I guess it also depends
on the region and the language I don't

5504
02:35:11,269 --> 02:35:11,279
on the region and the language I don't
 

5505
02:35:11,279 --> 02:35:14,510
on the region and the language I don't
know cuz yeah this one has a zipper uh I

5506
02:35:14,510 --> 02:35:14,520
know cuz yeah this one has a zipper uh I
 

5507
02:35:14,520 --> 02:35:16,750

5509
02:35:16,760 --> 02:35:19,110
I I I felt it was really important for
it to have a zipper uh cuz it's more

5510
02:35:19,110 --> 02:35:19,120
it to have a zipper uh cuz it's more
 

5511
02:35:19,120 --> 02:35:21,429
it to have a zipper uh cuz it's more
convenient in my opinion you can kind of

5512
02:35:21,429 --> 02:35:21,439
convenient in my opinion you can kind of
 

5513
02:35:21,439 --> 02:35:23,550
convenient in my opinion you can kind of
use it like as a jacket when it's a

5514
02:35:23,550 --> 02:35:23,560
use it like as a jacket when it's a

there's only one microphone if there
 

6745
03:07:11,000 --> 03:07:12,550
there's only one microphone if there
would have been more microphones I maybe

would have been more microphones I maybe
 

6747
03:07:12,560 --> 03:07:16,469
would have been more microphones I maybe
could have changed each knob on its own

6748
03:07:16,469 --> 03:07:16,479
could have changed each knob on its own
 

6749
03:07:16,479 --> 03:07:18,389
could have changed each knob on its own
but we just had one which is fine though

about the the size of the Parker but
 

7197
03:19:57,920 --> 03:19:59,710
about the the size of the Parker but
that's also one thing I was considering

7198
03:19:59,710 --> 03:19:59,720
that's also one thing I was considering
 

7199
03:19:59,720 --> 03:20:01,510
that's also one thing I was considering
like you know we can only do one size

7200
03:20:01,510 --> 03:20:01,520
like you know we can only do one size
 

7201
03:20:01,520 --> 03:20:03,229
like you know we can only do one size
but the fact that it has a

7202
03:20:03,229 --> 03:20:03,239
but the fact that it has a
 

7203
03:20:03,239 --> 03:20:05,630
but the fact that it has a
zipper means you can you can kind of

7204
03:20:05,630 --> 03:20:05,640
zipper means you can you can kind of
 

7205
03:20:05,640 --> 03:20:07,590
zipper means you can you can kind of
just like throw it over and you know use

7211
03:20:13,760 --> 03:20:16,469
perhaps if if that's the
case but at least maybe you can still

7212
03:20:16,469 --> 03:20:16,479

7615
03:31:07,760 --> 03:31:10,990
yeah I've been met with agreement of
course but it's like um I guess there's

7616
03:31:10,990 --> 03:31:11,000
course but it's like um I guess there's
 

7617
03:31:11,000 --> 03:31:13,630
course but it's like um I guess there's
a lot of other projects to be worked on

7618
03:31:13,630 --> 03:31:13,640
a lot of other projects to be worked on
 

7619
03:31:13,640 --> 03:31:16,229
a lot of other projects to be worked on
and that's this is like kind of on the

7620
03:31:16,229 --> 03:31:16,239
and that's this is like kind of on the
 

7621
03:31:16,239 --> 03:31:17,710
and that's this is like kind of on the
back burner

7622
03:31:17,710 --> 03:31:17,720
back burner
 

7623
03:31:17,720 --> 03:31:20,790
back burner
maybe um but it's definitely in the back

7624
03:31:20,790 --> 03:31:20,800
maybe um but it's definitely in the back
 

7625
03:31:20,800 --> 03:31:23,790
maybe um but it's definitely in the back
of their minds

7626
03:31:23,790 --> 03:31:23,800
of their minds
 

7627
03:31:23,800 --> 03:31:26,830
of their minds
so I think there will be more it's just

7628
03:31:26,830 --> 03:31:26,840
so I think there will be more it's just
 

7629
03:31:26,840 --> 03:31:28,590
so I think there will be more it's just
uh the question of

7630
03:31:28,590 --> 03:31:28,600
uh the question of
 

7631
03:31:28,600 --> 03:31:30,309
uh the question of
when

7632
03:31:30,309 --> 03:31:30,319
when
 

7633
03:31:30,319 --> 03:31:32,470

8122
03:44:24,910 --> 03:44:24,920
just you know a cute little badge didn't
 

8123
03:44:24,920 --> 03:44:27,950
just you know a cute little badge didn't
think it was actually possible cuz yeah

8124
03:44:27,950 --> 03:44:27,960
think it was actually possible cuz yeah
 

8125
03:44:27,960 --> 03:44:31,550
think it was actually possible cuz yeah
I never saw it combined before and

8126
03:44:31,550 --> 03:44:31,560
I never saw it combined before and
 

8127
03:44:31,560 --> 03:44:33,790
I never saw it combined before and
suddenly it's combined it looks so cool

8128
03:44:33,790 --> 03:44:33,800
suddenly it's combined it looks so cool
 

8129
03:44:33,800 --> 03:44:39,670
suddenly it's combined it looks so cool
and and now it makes sense why the sword

8130
03:44:39,670 --> 03:44:39,680
and and now it makes sense why the sword
 

8131
03:44:39,680 --> 03:44:42,710
and and now it makes sense why the sword
is so

8132
03:44:42,710 --> 03:44:42,720
