but
 

1903
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:39,430
but
okay five meters is probably

1904
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:39,440
okay five meters is probably
 

1905
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,309
okay five meters is probably
exaggerating

1906
00:45:42,309 --> 00:45:42,319

 

1907
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:43,990

and uh
yeah anyway so this was really

1914
00:45:49,589 --> 00:45:49,599
yeah anyway so this was really
 

1915
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:52,230
yeah anyway so this was really
surprising to because aft so many years
