put out something in 3D but the
 

3985
01:52:29,820 --> 01:52:32,810

3989
01:52:34,920 --> 01:52:39,590
absolutely nailed it with this one I've
made the best use possible from a 3D

3990
01:52:39,590 --> 01:52:39,600
made the best use possible from a 3D
 

3991

when you compare normal music videos uh

3998
01:52:49,129 --> 01:52:49,139
when you compare normal music videos uh
 

3999
01:52:49,139 --> 01:52:51,649
when you compare normal music videos uh
in the YouTuber world with like

4000
01:52:51,649 --> 01:52:51,659
in the YouTuber world with like
 

4001
01:52:51,659 --> 01:52:55,010
in the YouTuber world with like
just some like images like two one two

4002
01:52:55,010 --> 01:52:55,020
just some like images like two one two
 

4003
01:52:55,020 --> 01:52:57,350
just some like images like two one two
three illustrations or so that get used

4004
01:52:57,350 --> 01:52:57,360
three illustrations or so that get used
 

4005
01:52:57,360 --> 01:52:59,570
three illustrations or so that get used
in the music video That's like the most

4006
01:52:59,570 --> 01:52:59,580
in the music video That's like the most
 

4007
01:52:59,580 --> 01:53:01,550
in the music video That's like the most
basic one

4008
01:53:01,550 --> 01:53:01,560
basic one
 

4009
01:53:01,560 --> 01:53:04,729
basic one
um but it works well often and then then

4010
01:53:04,729 --> 01:53:04,739
um but it works well often and then then
 

4011
01:53:04,739 --> 01:53:08,330
um but it works well often and then then
there's like some next step music video

4012
01:53:08,330 --> 01:53:08,340
there's like some next step music video
 

4013
01:53:08,340 --> 01:53:10,149
there's like some next step music video
would be like animations

4014
01:53:10,149 --> 01:53:10,159
would be like animations
 

4015
01:53:10,159 --> 01:53:12,590
would be like animations
drawn animations

4016
01:53:12,590 --> 01:53:12,600
drawn animations
 

4017
01:53:12,600 --> 01:53:15,890
drawn animations
that one is uh the more animations you

4018
01:53:15,890 --> 01:53:15,900
that one is uh the more animations you
 

4019
01:53:15,900 --> 01:53:17,810
that one is uh the more animations you
do and the more high levels they are the

4020
01:53:17,810 --> 01:53:17,820
do and the more high levels they are the
 

4021
01:53:17,820 --> 01:53:20,709
do and the more high levels they are the
more really really expensive they get

4022
01:53:20,709 --> 01:53:20,719
more really really expensive they get
 

4023
01:53:20,719 --> 01:53:23,810
more really really expensive they get
and yeah the more implement the more you

4024
01:53:23,810 --> 01:53:23,820
and yeah the more implement the more you
 

4025
01:53:23,820 --> 01:53:25,609
and yeah the more implement the more you
implement of that style

4026
01:53:25,609 --> 01:53:25,619
implement of that style
 

4027
01:53:25,619 --> 01:53:28,189
implement of that style
the more expensive it gets and uh

4028
01:53:28,189 --> 01:53:28,199
the more expensive it gets and uh
 

4029
01:53:28,199 --> 01:53:31,669
the more expensive it gets and uh
however those are really popular

4030
01:53:31,669 --> 01:53:31,679
however those are really popular
 

4031
01:53:31,679 --> 01:53:35,149
however those are really popular
I would say and then 3D animation is

4032
01:53:35,149 --> 01:53:35,159
I would say and then 3D animation is
 

4033
01:53:35,159 --> 01:53:38,390
I would say and then 3D animation is
actually from what I've seen so far even

4034
01:53:38,390 --> 01:53:38,400
actually from what I've seen so far even
 

4035
01:53:38,400 --> 01:53:41,470
actually from what I've seen so far even
though it costs a lot too

4036
01:53:41,470 --> 01:53:41,480
though it costs a lot too
 

4037
01:53:41,480 --> 01:53:46,970
though it costs a lot too
uh it doesn't quite get the amount of

4038
01:53:46,970 --> 01:53:46,980
uh it doesn't quite get the amount of
 

4039
01:53:46,980 --> 01:53:48,410
uh it doesn't quite get the amount of
positive feedback

4040
01:53:48,410 --> 01:53:48,420
positive feedback
 

4041
01:53:48,420 --> 01:53:51,410
positive feedback
as you would think it does

4042
01:53:51,410 --> 01:53:51,420
as you would think it does
 

4043
01:53:51,420 --> 01:53:52,790
as you would think it does
hmm

4044
01:53:52,790 --> 01:53:52,800
hmm
 

4045
01:53:52,800 --> 01:53:56,270
hmm
sometimes even the cheapest option does

4046
01:53:56,270 --> 01:53:56,280
sometimes even the cheapest option does
 

4047
01:53:56,280 --> 01:53:59,090
sometimes even the cheapest option does
better

4048
01:53:59,090 --> 01:53:59,100

 

4049
01:53:59,100 --> 01:54:04,010

than if you make a 3D music video

4050
01:54:04,010 --> 01:54:04,020

 

4051
01:54:04,020 --> 01:54:06,890

hmm

4052
01:54:06,890 --> 01:54:06,900

 

4053
01:54:06,900 --> 01:54:09,410

yeah for some reason people don't like

4054
01:54:09,410 --> 01:54:09,420
yeah for some reason people don't like
 

4055
01:54:09,420 --> 01:54:12,890
yeah for some reason people don't like
it that much A lot of the time but I

4056
01:54:12,890 --> 01:54:12,900
it that much A lot of the time but I
 

4057
01:54:12,900 --> 01:54:15,590
it that much A lot of the time but I
think I have

4058
01:54:15,590 --> 01:54:15,600
think I have
 

4059
01:54:15,600 --> 01:54:18,250
think I have
done it the right way

4060
01:54:18,250 --> 01:54:18,260
done it the right way
 

4061
01:54:18,260 --> 01:54:22,129
done it the right way
like the whole visuals

4062
01:54:22,129 --> 01:54:22,139
like the whole visuals
 

4063
01:54:22,139 --> 01:54:25,010
like the whole visuals
um the different scenes the outfit the

4064
01:54:25,010 --> 01:54:25,020
um the different scenes the outfit the
 

4065
01:54:25,020 --> 01:54:28,490
um the different scenes the outfit the
way I changed it so it would fit and Rel

4066
01:54:28,490 --> 01:54:28,500
way I changed it so it would fit and Rel
 

4067
01:54:28,500 --> 01:54:31,270
way I changed it so it would fit and Rel
as much as I could and the choreography

4068
01:54:31,270 --> 01:54:31,280
as much as I could and the choreography
 

4069
01:54:31,280 --> 01:54:34,010
as much as I could and the choreography
the sick choreography

4070
01:54:34,010 --> 01:54:34,020
the sick choreography
 

4071
01:54:34,020 --> 01:54:35,930
the sick choreography
hmm

4072
01:54:35,930 --> 01:54:35,940
hmm
 

4073
01:54:35,940 --> 01:54:39,410
hmm
the city choreography very important

4074
01:54:39,410 --> 01:54:39,420
the city choreography very important
 

4075
01:54:39,420 --> 01:54:41,930
the city choreography very important
so I'm really happy that even though

4076
01:54:41,930 --> 01:54:41,940
so I'm really happy that even though
 

4077
01:54:41,940 --> 01:54:43,609
so I'm really happy that even though
it's 3D

4078
01:54:43,609 --> 01:54:43,619
it's 3D
 

4079
01:54:43,619 --> 01:54:46,250
it's 3D
people like it so much because like if I

4080
01:54:46,250 --> 01:54:46,260
people like it so much because like if I
 

4081
01:54:46,260 --> 01:54:49,189
people like it so much because like if I
want to put dance in my music and I

4082
01:54:49,189 --> 01:54:49,199
want to put dance in my music and I
 

4083
01:54:49,199 --> 01:54:52,729
want to put dance in my music and I
really want to then it has to be free

really want to then it has to be free
 

4085
01:54:52,739 --> 01:54:57,229
really want to then it has to be free
if I were to animes that dance in 2D and

4086
01:54:57,229 --> 01:54:57,239
if I were to animes that dance in 2D and
 

4087
01:54:57,239 --> 01:55:00,050
if I were to animes that dance in 2D and
drawn animation first of all it would

4088
01:55:00,050 --> 01:55:00,060
drawn animation first of all it would
 

4089
01:55:00,060 --> 01:55:02,149
drawn animation first of all it would
look this smooth and even if I spent

4090
01:55:02,149 --> 01:55:02,159
look this smooth and even if I spent
 

4091
01:55:02,159 --> 01:55:04,189
look this smooth and even if I spent
like Millions on it it's like not worth

4092
01:55:04,189 --> 01:55:04,199
like Millions on it it's like not worth
 

4093
01:55:04,199 --> 01:55:05,950
like Millions on it it's like not worth
it

4094
01:55:05,950 --> 01:55:05,960
it
 

4095
01:55:05,960 --> 01:55:10,070
it
and I I really really wanted to make

4096
01:55:10,070 --> 01:55:10,080
and I I really really wanted to make
 

4097
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:12,050
and I I really really wanted to make
more stuff like this where I can show

4098
01:55:12,050 --> 01:55:12,060
more stuff like this where I can show
 

4099
01:55:12,060 --> 01:55:14,330
more stuff like this where I can show
off my my dancing so this is really the

4100
01:55:14,330 --> 01:55:14,340
off my my dancing so this is really the
 

4101
01:55:14,340 --> 01:55:16,070
off my my dancing so this is really the
only way for me

4102
01:55:16,070 --> 01:55:16,080
only way for me
 

4103
01:55:16,080 --> 01:55:16,790
only way for me
um

4104
01:55:16,790 --> 01:55:16,800
um
 

4105
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:20,750
um
3D freebie is the one chance that I get

4106
01:55:20,750 --> 01:55:20,760
3D freebie is the one chance that I get
 

4107
01:55:20,760 --> 01:55:23,689
3D freebie is the one chance that I get
at expressing myself

4108
01:55:23,689 --> 01:55:23,699
at expressing myself
 

4109
01:55:23,699 --> 01:55:25,750
at expressing myself
yeah

4110
01:55:25,750 --> 01:55:25,760
yeah
 

4111
01:55:25,760 --> 01:55:29,330
yeah
expressing myself with my full body

4112
01:55:29,330 --> 01:55:29,340
expressing myself with my full body
 

4113
01:55:29,340 --> 01:55:32,810
expressing myself with my full body
and I think a cool choreography gives a

4114
01:55:32,810 --> 01:55:32,820
and I think a cool choreography gives a
 

4115
01:55:32,820 --> 01:55:36,109
and I think a cool choreography gives a
song so much more to look at and enjoy

4116
01:55:36,109 --> 01:55:36,119
song so much more to look at and enjoy
 

4117
01:55:36,119 --> 01:55:38,450
song so much more to look at and enjoy
and

4118
01:55:38,450 --> 01:55:38,460
and
 

4119
01:55:38,460 --> 01:55:40,129
and
be hype about

4120
01:55:40,129 --> 01:55:40,139
be hype about
 

4121
01:55:40,139 --> 01:55:42,709
be hype about
appreciate

4122
01:55:42,709 --> 01:55:42,719

 

4123
01:55:42,719 --> 01:55:46,490

5314
02:27:09,950 --> 02:27:09,960
feel like is such a such a basic
 

5315
02:27:09,960 --> 02:27:11,630
feel like is such a such a basic
question is that people ask in like

5316
02:27:11,630 --> 02:27:11,640
question is that people ask in like
 

5317
02:27:11,640 --> 02:27:13,790
question is that people ask in like
interviews but also like generally if I

5318
02:27:13,790 --> 02:27:13,800

5321
02:27:16,260 --> 02:27:18,590
if I open marshmallows or whatever
that's such a difficult question to

5322
02:27:18,590 --> 02:27:18,600
that's such a difficult question to
 

5323
02:27:18,600 --> 02:27:20,090
that's such a difficult question to
answer

5324
02:27:20,090 --> 02:27:20,100
answer
 

5325
02:27:20,100 --> 02:27:23,690
answer
that's why I I try to not ask stuff like

5326
02:27:23,690 --> 02:27:23,700
that's why I I try to not ask stuff like
 

5327

5337
02:27:34,020 --> 02:27:36,650
I'm sure that if I would put the girls
that I interview on the spot like that

5338
02:27:36,650 --> 02:27:36,660
that I interview on the spot like that
 

5339
02:27:36,660 --> 02:27:38,990
that I interview on the spot like that
that they often wouldn't know

um
because I don't think I'm the only one

5348
02:27:45,050 --> 02:27:45,060
because I don't think I'm the only one
 

5349
02:27:45,060 --> 02:27:46,370
because I don't think I'm the only one
