um usually the bus has like only one

3820
01:56:38,950 --> 01:56:38,960
um usually the bus has like only one
 

3821
01:56:38,960 --> 01:56:41,189
um usually the bus has like only one
price I guess

3822
01:56:41,189 --> 01:56:41,199
price I guess
 

3823
01:56:41,199 --> 01:56:44,830
price I guess
so it charges you whatever like 150 250

3824
01:56:44,830 --> 01:56:44,840
so it charges you whatever like 150 250
 

3825
01:56:44,840 --> 01:56:47,870
so it charges you whatever like 150 250
or so Yen I guess in the beginning but

3826
01:56:47,870 --> 01:56:47,880
or so Yen I guess in the beginning but
 

3827
01:56:47,880 --> 01:56:49,510
or so Yen I guess in the beginning but
sometimes I've had buses in Japan where

3828
01:56:49,510 --> 01:56:49,520
sometimes I've had buses in Japan where
 

3829
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:52,189
sometimes I've had buses in Japan where
where at the exit door there's another

3830
01:56:52,189 --> 01:56:52,199
where at the exit door there's another
 

3831
01:56:52,199 --> 01:56:56,149
where at the exit door there's another
PE touch terminal where it will

3832
01:56:56,149 --> 01:56:56,159
PE touch terminal where it will
 

3833
01:56:56,159 --> 01:56:58,510
PE touch terminal where it will
calculate how far you've been how far

3834
01:56:58,510 --> 01:56:58,520
calculate how far you've been how far
 

3835
01:56:58,520 --> 01:57:00,709
calculate how far you've been how far
you've traveled and then deduct it from

3836
01:57:00,709 --> 01:57:00,719
you've traveled and then deduct it from
 

3837
01:57:00,719 --> 01:57:03,430
you've traveled and then deduct it from
your card but that depends on the bus

3838
01:57:03,430 --> 01:57:03,440
your card but that depends on the bus
 

3839
01:57:03,440 --> 01:57:04,750
your card but that depends on the bus
you have to check if there's like a

3840
01:57:04,750 --> 01:57:04,760
you have to check if there's like a
 

3841
01:57:04,760 --> 01:57:06,990
you have to check if there's like a
terminal at the exit if there's no

3842
01:57:06,990 --> 01:57:07,000
terminal at the exit if there's no
 

3843
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:08,669
terminal at the exit if there's no
terminal at the exit and you see like

3844
01:57:08,669 --> 01:57:08,679
terminal at the exit and you see like
 

3845
01:57:08,679 --> 01:57:12,430
terminal at the exit and you see like
people walking out of the bus without

3846
01:57:12,430 --> 01:57:12,440
people walking out of the bus without
 

3847
01:57:12,440 --> 01:57:14,910
people walking out of the bus without
touching anything then you're safe you

3848
01:57:14,910 --> 01:57:14,920
touching anything then you're safe you
 

3849
01:57:14,920 --> 01:57:16,750
touching anything then you're safe you
can just walk out the door

3850
01:57:16,750 --> 01:57:16,760
can just walk out the door
 

3851
01:57:16,760 --> 01:57:18,390
can just walk out the door
normally

3852
01:57:18,390 --> 01:57:18,400
normally
 

3853
01:57:18,400 --> 01:57:19,950
normally
yeah

3854
01:57:19,950 --> 01:57:19,960
yeah
 

3855
01:57:19,960 --> 01:57:21,629
yeah
that's that's when it's a bus that's

3856
01:57:21,629 --> 01:57:21,639
that's that's when it's a bus that's
 

3857
01:57:21,639 --> 01:57:25,629
that's that's when it's a bus that's
payment per Stu but it depends really uh

3858
01:57:25,629 --> 01:57:25,639
payment per Stu but it depends really uh
 

3859
01:57:25,639 --> 01:57:27,310
payment per Stu but it depends really uh
probably if it's like a bus that goes

3860
01:57:27,310 --> 01:57:27,320
probably if it's like a bus that goes
 

3861
01:57:27,320 --> 01:57:30,990
probably if it's like a bus that goes
really far like even out uh of the city

3862
01:57:30,990 --> 01:57:31,000
really far like even out uh of the city
 

3863
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,750
really far like even out uh of the city
maybe then it would be a bus like that

3864
01:57:33,750 --> 01:57:33,760
maybe then it would be a bus like that
 

3865
01:57:33,760 --> 01:57:36,109
maybe then it would be a bus like that
but if it's more like a bus that stays

3866
01:57:36,109 --> 01:57:36,119
but if it's more like a bus that stays
 

3867
01:57:36,119 --> 01:57:38,870
but if it's more like a bus that stays
within Tokyo then chances are that it's

3868
01:57:38,870 --> 01:57:38,880
within Tokyo then chances are that it's
 

3869
01:57:38,880 --> 01:57:41,430
within Tokyo then chances are that it's
not per station but per bus

3870
01:57:41,430 --> 01:57:41,440
not per station but per bus
 

3871
01:57:41,440 --> 01:57:43,270
not per station but per bus
