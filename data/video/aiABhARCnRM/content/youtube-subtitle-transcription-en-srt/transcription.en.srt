okay
is this double or

19860
09:22:42,390 --> 09:22:42,400
is this double or
 

19861
09:22:42,400 --> 09:22:45,110
is this double or
let's see it's currently on monitor and

i think it's like

21248
09:52:27,746 --> 09:52:27,756
i think it's like
 

21249
09:52:27,756 --> 09:52:29,830
i think it's like
if if you imagine a group of people

21250
09:52:29,830 --> 09:52:29,840
if if you imagine a group of people
 

21251
09:52:29,840 --> 09:52:31,510
if if you imagine a group of people
walked in and they each had these dots

21252
09:52:31,510 --> 09:52:31,520
walked in and they each had these dots
 

21253
09:52:31,520 --> 09:52:32,950
walked in and they each had these dots
on their body

21254
09:52:32,950 --> 09:52:32,960
on their body
 

21255
09:52:32,960 --> 09:52:35,110
on their body
and if the dots correspond to whether or

21256
09:52:35,110 --> 09:52:35,120
and if the dots correspond to whether or
 

21257
09:52:35,120 --> 09:52:37,830
and if the dots correspond to whether or
not they're a criminal i guess right

21258
09:52:37,830 --> 09:52:37,840
not they're a criminal i guess right
 

21259
09:52:37,840 --> 09:52:38,790
not they're a criminal i guess right
so

21260
09:52:38,790 --> 09:52:38,800
so
 

21261
09:52:38,800 --> 09:52:40,790
so
if in the group of people that walk in

21262
09:52:40,790 --> 09:52:40,800
if in the group of people that walk in
 

21263
09:52:40,800 --> 09:52:43,266
if in the group of people that walk in
one of them has five dots on them then

21264
09:52:43,266 --> 09:52:43,276
one of them has five dots on them then
 

21265
09:52:43,276 --> 09:52:45,906
one of them has five dots on them then
the lowest number is the criminal but if

21266
09:52:45,906 --> 09:52:45,916
the lowest number is the criminal but if
 

21267
09:52:45,916 --> 09:52:48,070
the lowest number is the criminal but if
there is no person with five dots then

21268
09:52:48,070 --> 09:52:48,080
there is no person with five dots then
 

21269
09:52:48,080 --> 09:52:51,510
there is no person with five dots then
the highest number is the criminal

21270
09:52:51,510 --> 09:52:51,520
the highest number is the criminal
 

21271
09:52:51,520 --> 09:52:54,630
the highest number is the criminal
huh

21272
09:52:54,630 --> 09:52:54,640

 

21273
09:52:54,640 --> 09:52:58,550

okay so now it's showing me two numbers

21274
09:52:58,550 --> 09:52:58,560
okay so now it's showing me two numbers
 

21275
09:52:58,560 --> 09:53:00,230
okay so now it's showing me two numbers
uh the title the highest value is the

21276
09:53:00,230 --> 09:53:00,240
uh the title the highest value is the
 

21277
09:53:00,240 --> 09:53:02,470
uh the title the highest value is the
criminal

21278
09:53:02,470 --> 09:53:02,480
criminal
 

21279
09:53:02,480 --> 09:53:04,950
criminal
okay so the one that i don't see it

21280
09:53:04,950 --> 09:53:04,960
okay so the one that i don't see it
 

21281
09:53:04,960 --> 09:53:07,670
okay so the one that i don't see it
could be a five and in that case

21282
09:53:07,670 --> 09:53:07,680
could be a five and in that case
 

21283
09:53:07,680 --> 09:53:09,670
could be a five and in that case
it would be the

21284
09:53:09,670 --> 09:53:09,680
it would be the
 

21285
09:53:09,680 --> 09:53:12,710
it would be the
but i don't see the five so for now i'm

21286
09:53:12,710 --> 09:53:12,720
but i don't see the five so for now i'm
 

21287

i've made
many many many memories maybe because i

25282
11:36:05,030 --> 11:36:05,040
many many many memories maybe because i
 

25283
11:36:05,040 --> 11:36:07,586
many many many memories maybe because i
have a brain a lot of them are really

25284

hard to remember
 

25287
11:36:10,160 --> 11:36:12,230
hard to remember
or too much to remember

25288
11:36:12,230 --> 11:36:12,240
or too much to remember
 

25289
11:36:12,240 --> 11:36:14,710
or too much to remember
as i told you guys my memory card

25290
11:36:14,710 --> 11:36:14,720
as i told you guys my memory card
 

25291
11:36:14,720 --> 11:36:16,070
as i told you guys my memory card
there's not enough space i need to

25292
11:36:16,070 --> 11:36:16,080
there's not enough space i need to
 

25293
11:36:16,080 --> 11:36:18,070
there's not enough space i need to
upgrade it but it's impossible somehow

25294
11:36:18,070 --> 11:36:18,080
upgrade it but it's impossible somehow
 

25295
11:36:18,080 --> 11:36:19,586
upgrade it but it's impossible somehow
it doesn't work

25296
11:36:19,586 --> 11:36:19,596
it doesn't work
 

25297
11:36:19,596 --> 11:36:21,106
it doesn't work
but um

25298
11:36:21,106 --> 11:36:21,116
but um
 

25299
11:36:21,116 --> 11:36:23,670
but um
i think the reason why

25300
11:36:23,670 --> 11:36:23,680
i think the reason why
 

25301
11:36:23,680 --> 11:36:26,870
i think the reason why
they are hard to remember is because

25302
11:36:26,870 --> 11:36:26,880
they are hard to remember is because
 

25303
11:36:26,880 --> 11:36:28,070
they are hard to remember is because
