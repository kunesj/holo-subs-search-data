was about building a tunnel to Atlantis.  We did a collaboration,
but I wonder how many hours it took to dig?

there were a lot of zombies, and they all
 

1096
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,890
there were a lot of zombies, and they all
had eggs.When I screened them, I found out that

Well, in Atlantis, they

1105
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:40,740
Well, in Atlantis, they
 

1106
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,849
Well, in Atlantis, they
didn't create Gura-chan after all.

1107
00:36:43,849 --> 00:36:43,859
didn't create Gura-chan after all.
 

1108
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:45,230
didn't create Gura-chan after all.

other important things at the end, so

01:02:50,450 --> 01:02:50,460

 

1966
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:53,950

boat. There's

1967
01:02:53,950 --> 01:02:53,960
boat. There's
 

1968
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:56,630
boat. There's
nothing there. There

1969
01:02:56,630 --> 01:02:56,640
nothing there. There
 

1970
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,730
nothing there. There
was a Pico where the door didn't work, but

1971
01:02:58,730 --> 01:02:58,740
was a Pico where the door didn't work, but
 

1972
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:02,870
was a Pico where the door didn't work, but
wait a minute, it's okay here.  I

1973
01:03:02,870 --> 01:03:02,880

 

1974
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,630

worked hard to make it, and I

1975
01:03:05,630 --> 01:03:05,640
worked hard to make it, and I
 

1976
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:11,569
worked hard to make it, and I
rode along with it.It's

1977
01:03:11,569 --> 01:03:11,579

 

1978
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:17,990

amazing, it's a little short, but it has a bit of

1979
01:03:17,990 --> 01:03:18,000

 

1980
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:23,109

history, but when I

1981
01:03:23,109 --> 01:03:23,119

 

1982
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:25,250

first

1983
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:25,260
first
 

1984
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:28,430
first
went out to play, I

1985
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:28,440
went out to play, I
 

1986
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:30,589
went out to play, I
passed by this waste, so I rode

1987
01:03:30,589 --> 01:03:30,599
passed by this waste, so I rode
 

1988
01:03:30,599 --> 01:03:31,849
passed by this waste, so I rode
in a tortoise.

1989
01:03:31,849 --> 01:03:31,859
in a tortoise.
 

1990
01:03:31,859 --> 01:03:38,510
in a tortoise.
All the people in the village died.I

1991
01:03:38,510 --> 01:03:38,520

 

1992
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:42,650

felt sorry for them, so I made a plan to rebuild it.That's what

1993
01:03:42,650 --> 01:03:47,569
felt sorry for them, so I made a plan to rebuild it.That's what
 

1994
01:03:47,569 --> 01:03:47,579

 

1995
01:03:47,579 --> 01:03:50,510

Ina-chan, Chiara-chan,

1996
01:03:50,510 --> 01:03:50,520
Ina-chan, Chiara-chan,
 

1997
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:54,230
Ina-chan, Chiara-chan,
Gari-chan, and I first walked

1998
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:54,240
Gari-chan, and I first walked
 

1999
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:56,329
Gari-chan, and I first walked
through this village in the early days.  When I

2000
01:03:56,329 --> 01:03:56,339
through this village in the early days.  When I
 

2001
01:03:56,339 --> 01:03:59,870
through this village in the early days.  When I
passed by, some kind of enemy came and all of them

2002
01:03:59,870 --> 01:03:59,880
passed by, some kind of enemy came and all of them
 

2003
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:03,170
passed by, some kind of enemy came and all of them
died. That villager was

2004
01:04:03,170 --> 01:04:03,180
died. That villager was
 

2005
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:05,270
died. That villager was
really dead, Ekari-chan,

2006
01:04:05,270 --> 01:04:05,280
really dead, Ekari-chan,
 

2007
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:08,270
really dead, Ekari-chan,
so I guess that's it

2008
01:04:08,270 --> 01:04:08,280
so I guess that's it
 

2009
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:14,329
so I guess that's it
. I'm so

2010
01:04:14,329 --> 01:04:14,339

 

2011
01:04:14,339 --> 01:04:15,589
