01:21:52,669 --> 01:21:52,679
building this tunnel together history is
 

3439
01:21:52,679 --> 01:21:54,649
building this tunnel together history is
in these Halls

3440
01:21:54,649 --> 01:21:54,659
in these Halls
 

3441
01:21:54,659 --> 01:21:58,209
in these Halls

3444
01:22:01,310 --> 01:22:01,320
uh some doors here will lead to little
 

3445
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:04,610
uh some doors here will lead to little
ruins where the girls were maybe mining

3446
01:22:04,610 --> 01:22:04,620
ruins where the girls were maybe mining
 

3447
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:05,750
ruins where the girls were maybe mining
a little bit

3448
01:22:05,750 --> 01:22:05,760
a little bit
 

3449
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:08,990
a little bit
and one exit also leads to Phoenix then

3450
01:22:08,990 --> 01:22:09,000
and one exit also leads to Phoenix then
 

3451
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,729
and one exit also leads to Phoenix then
it's another way to get into Phoenix

3452
01:22:10,729 --> 01:22:10,739
it's another way to get into Phoenix
 

3453
01:22:10,739 --> 01:22:11,770
it's another way to get into Phoenix
then

3454
01:22:11,770 --> 01:22:11,780
then
 

3455
01:22:11,780 --> 01:22:14,810
then
where are you I'm still there I'm just a

3456
01:22:14,810 --> 01:22:14,820
where are you I'm still there I'm just a
 

3457
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:16,610
where are you I'm still there I'm just a
little ways behind I got stuck oh no

3458
01:22:16,610 --> 01:22:16,620
little ways behind I got stuck oh no
 

3459
01:22:16,620 --> 01:22:19,490

um yeah so there's some smaller mines

3462
01:22:22,250 --> 01:22:22,260
um yeah so there's some smaller mines
 

3463
01:22:22,260 --> 01:22:25,610
um yeah so there's some smaller mines
some bigger mines here and there

3464
01:22:25,610 --> 01:22:25,620
some bigger mines here and there
 

3465
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:28,910
some bigger mines here and there
uh but they've been pretty much mined

3466
01:22:28,910 --> 01:22:28,920
uh but they've been pretty much mined
 

3467
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:30,490
uh but they've been pretty much mined
all over

3468
01:22:30,490 --> 01:22:30,500
all over
 

3469
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:33,770
all over
upcoming is the place where I died I

where I died
 

3475
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:41,950
where I died
it would be a sign that that could be

3476
01:22:41,950 --> 01:22:41,960
it would be a sign that that could be
 

3477
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:44,930
it would be a sign that that could be
I'm not sure ah this isn't

3478
01:22:44,930 --> 01:22:44,940
I'm not sure ah this isn't
 

3479
01:22:44,940 --> 01:22:45,729
I'm not sure ah this isn't
it

3480
01:22:45,729 --> 01:22:45,739
it
 

3481
01:22:45,739 --> 01:22:49,370
it
keep an eye out for a sign I guess

3482
01:22:49,370 --> 01:22:49,380
keep an eye out for a sign I guess
 

3483
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:52,330
keep an eye out for a sign I guess
it's too fast read it though

3484
01:22:52,330 --> 01:22:52,340
it's too fast read it though
 

3485
01:22:52,340 --> 01:22:55,270
it's too fast read it though
yeah I died here

3486
01:22:55,270 --> 01:22:55,280
yeah I died here
 

3487
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:57,350

yeah
 

3491
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:03,470
yeah
this is the long ride I wonder if yeah

3492
01:23:03,470 --> 01:23:03,480
this is the long ride I wonder if yeah
 

3493
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:07,729
this is the long ride I wonder if yeah
it is faster with more Redstone thingies

3494
01:23:07,729 --> 01:23:07,739
it is faster with more Redstone thingies
 

3495
01:23:07,739 --> 01:23:10,669
it is faster with more Redstone thingies
probably or we should replace it with

3496
01:23:10,669 --> 01:23:10,679
probably or we should replace it with
 

3497
01:23:10,679 --> 01:23:13,430
probably or we should replace it with
Ice Baby should be replaced with ice in

3498
01:23:13,430 --> 01:23:13,440
Ice Baby should be replaced with ice in
 

3499
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:15,709
Ice Baby should be replaced with ice in
my opinion

3500
01:23:15,709 --> 01:23:15,719
my opinion
 

3501
01:23:15,719 --> 01:23:18,050
my opinion
ah but you know I'mma made this rail

3502
01:23:18,050 --> 01:23:18,060
ah but you know I'mma made this rail
 

3503
01:23:18,060 --> 01:23:21,410
ah but you know I'mma made this rail
after we made the tunnel and it's like a

3504
01:23:21,410 --> 01:23:21,420
after we made the tunnel and it's like a
 

3505
01:23:21,420 --> 01:23:23,149
after we made the tunnel and it's like a
little trip down memory lane yeah it's

3506
01:23:23,149 --> 01:23:23,159
little trip down memory lane yeah it's
 

3507
01:23:23,159 --> 01:23:27,830
little trip down memory lane yeah it's
history so it should stay this way

3508
01:23:27,830 --> 01:23:27,840

 

3509
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:30,350

I feel very emotionally attached to the

need to go through ones
 

6055
02:23:08,160 --> 02:23:11,210
need to go through ones
um but oh like basically this leads to

6056
02:23:11,210 --> 02:23:11,220
um but oh like basically this leads to
 

6057
02:23:11,220 --> 02:23:12,889
um but oh like basically this leads to
the new world

6058
02:23:12,889 --> 02:23:12,899
the new world
 

6059
02:23:12,899 --> 02:23:14,210

02:23:14,210 --> 02:23:14,220
oh
 

6061
02:23:14,220 --> 02:23:18,710
oh
the the news connected one that you uh

6062
02:23:18,710 --> 02:23:18,720
the the news connected one that you uh
 

6063
02:23:18,720 --> 02:23:20,570
the the news connected one that you uh
yeah I think that should be where you

6064
02:23:20,570 --> 02:23:20,580
yeah I think that should be where you
 

6065
02:23:20,580 --> 02:23:22,670
yeah I think that should be where you
want to go

6066
02:23:22,670 --> 02:23:22,680
want to go
 

6067
02:23:22,680 --> 02:23:24,410
want to go
where is this

6068
02:23:24,410 --> 02:23:24,420
where is this
 

6069
02:23:24,420 --> 02:23:25,670
where is this
eh

6070
02:23:25,670 --> 02:23:25,680
eh
 

6071
02:23:25,680 --> 02:23:28,849
eh
Eh this is this is the combined server

6072
02:23:28,849 --> 02:23:28,859
Eh this is this is the combined server
 

6073
02:23:28,859 --> 02:23:31,550
Eh this is this is the combined server
as far as okay I'm just now I'm pretty

6074
02:23:31,550 --> 02:23:31,560
as far as okay I'm just now I'm pretty
 

6075
02:23:31,560 --> 02:23:34,010
as far as okay I'm just now I'm pretty
sure the other one leads to the same to

6076
02:23:34,010 --> 02:23:34,020
sure the other one leads to the same to
 

6077
02:23:34,020 --> 02:23:36,590
sure the other one leads to the same to
the same one no that's just like that

6078
02:23:36,590 --> 02:23:36,600
the same one no that's just like that
 

6079
02:23:36,600 --> 02:23:40,270
the same one no that's just like that
leads to the Japan World I think but

6080
02:23:40,270 --> 02:23:40,280
leads to the Japan World I think but
 

6081
02:23:40,280 --> 02:23:43,370
leads to the Japan World I think but
I know that's the old Japan World down

6082
02:23:43,370 --> 02:23:43,380
I know that's the old Japan World down
 

6083
02:23:43,380 --> 02:23:46,969
I know that's the old Japan World down
there but you can basically wait wait if

6084
02:23:46,969 --> 02:23:46,979
there but you can basically wait wait if
 

6085
02:23:46,979 --> 02:23:49,370
there but you can basically wait wait if
you go through here

6086
02:23:49,370 --> 02:23:49,380
you go through here
 

6087
02:23:49,380 --> 02:23:51,110
you go through here
um and then you look up here there's the

6088
02:23:51,110 --> 02:23:51,120
um and then you look up here there's the
 

6089
02:23:51,120 --> 02:23:53,210
um and then you look up here there's the
en world and then there's Japan World

6090
02:23:53,210 --> 02:23:53,220
en world and then there's Japan World
 

6091
02:23:53,220 --> 02:23:55,130
en world and then there's Japan World
and then there's ID world you would

6092
02:23:55,130 --> 02:23:55,140
and then there's ID world you would
 

6093
02:23:55,140 --> 02:23:56,510
and then there's ID world you would
think you're already in Japan well but
