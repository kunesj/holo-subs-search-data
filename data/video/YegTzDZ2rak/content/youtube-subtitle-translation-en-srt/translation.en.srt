getting too lazy. No, I'm entering. So this is probably better. It's probably already arbitrary.

00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:09,230

That's right, with the power of God,

660
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:09,240
That's right, with the power of God,
 

661
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,190
That's right, with the power of God,
you don't have to press it. It's okay.

662
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:16,310
you don't have to press it. It's okay.
 

663

664
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,789

Oh, I'm sorry, I'll excuse Sado's announcement. Kaiha-san, Roboko-san, Nakia-san,

665
00:25:19,789 --> 00:25:19,799
Oh, I'm sorry, I'll excuse Sado's announcement. Kaiha-san, Roboko-san, Nakia-san,
 

666
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:25,549
Oh, I'm sorry, I'll excuse Sado's announcement. Kaiha-san, Roboko-san, Nakia-san,
Amaka-san, and Choko-san.  I'd

667
00:25:25,549 --> 00:25:25,559
Amaka-san, and Choko-san.  I'd
 

668
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:29,789
Amaka-san, and Choko-san.  I'd
like to ask the White Technician Channel to do the

669
00:25:29,789 --> 00:25:29,799
like to ask the White Technician Channel to do the
 

670
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:35,029
like to ask the White Technician Channel to do the
opposite. What's going to happen to us? This

671
00:25:35,029 --> 00:25:35,039
opposite. What's going to happen to us? This
 

672
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,750
opposite. What's going to happen to us? This
is the opposite. It's not because everyone is running away now. It seems that the

673
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:38,760
is the opposite. It's not because everyone is running away now. It seems that the
 

674
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:42,350
is the opposite. It's not because everyone is running away now. It seems that the
fugitives are moving, so the fugitives are on the

00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:42,360
fugitives are moving, so the fugitives are on the

fugitives are moving, so the fugitives are on the
Contestant Channel.

Contestant Channel.

Isn't it okay if you ask me? What number are you talking about

00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:47,440
Isn't it okay if you ask me? What number are you talking about

Isn't it okay if you ask me? What number are you talking about
in the same place?

Yes, hello,

kind of like that, right? Only the hunters

00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:13,710

yeah,

749
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:18,750

in the end, which one is the

750
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:18,760

 

751
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:26,430

one who runs away?  It

752
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:31,190

 

753
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:31,200

 

754
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,389

seems like the runaway defender/fugitive is probably set automatically, so

755
00:28:34,389 --> 00:28:34,399
seems like the runaway defender/fugitive is probably set automatically, so
 

756
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:37,230
seems like the runaway defender/fugitive is probably set automatically, so
that's why that question comes up.For

757
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:37,240
that's why that question comes up.For
 

758
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:41,669
that's why that question comes up.For
example, if the hunter is a member of the red group and the hunter is a

759
00:28:41,669 --> 00:28:41,679
example, if the hunter is a member of the red group and the hunter is a
 

760
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,990
example, if the hunter is a member of the red group and the hunter is a
member of the white group, then the answer is ``oh''.  I'm being targeted, so I'm

761
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:44,000
member of the white group, then the answer is ``oh''.  I'm being targeted, so I'm
 

762
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,830
member of the white group, then the answer is ``oh''.  I'm being targeted, so I'm
running away, and then I click,

763
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:47,840
running away, and then I click,
 

764
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,470
running away, and then I click,
and then I get caught with a rope, so

765
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:50,480
and then I get caught with a rope, so
 

766
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,070
and then I get caught with a rope, so
even if I'm already caught, I feel like I want to run away with all my strength.  I'm

767
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:54,080
even if I'm already caught, I feel like I want to run away with all my strength.  I'm

00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,389
even if I'm already caught, I feel like I want to run away with all my strength.  I'm

774
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:08,710

, I can't get out, so the back of the cage is surprisingly a hiding place.Oh

775
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:08,720
, I can't get out, so the back of the cage is surprisingly a hiding place.Oh

yeah, I'm a little anti, and

777
00:29:10,509 --> 00:29:10,519
yeah, I'm a little anti, and
 

778
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:14,350
yeah, I'm a little anti, and
I'm a bit of an

779
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:14,360
I'm a bit of an
 

780
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:17,990
I'm a bit of an
anti.  I'm heading towards the cage, so I

781
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:18,000
anti.  I'm heading towards the cage, so I
 

782
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,029
anti.  I'm heading towards the cage, so I
have a hunch that there's no one behind the cage. I

783
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:25,310
have a hunch that there's no one behind the cage. I
 

784
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:25,320

 

785
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,909

wonder if that's the case behind me, too. I'm a little worried about that, right now. I wonder

786
00:29:28,909 --> 00:29:28,919
wonder if that's the case behind me, too. I'm a little worried about that, right now. I wonder
 

787
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:31,909
wonder if that's the case behind me, too. I'm a little worried about that, right now. I wonder
if that's what the staff is saying. I'm

788
00:29:31,909 --> 00:29:31,919
if that's what the staff is saying. I'm
 

789
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,990
if that's what the staff is saying. I'm
watching the text channel, but it's white.  set  There are

790
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:34,000
watching the text channel, but it's white.  set  There are
 

791
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:40,950
watching the text channel, but it's white.  set  There are
7 people who ran away as contestants, so it's the second tier,

792
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:40,960
7 people who ran away as contestants, so it's the second tier,
 

793
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,470
7 people who ran away as contestants, so it's the second tier,
but I guess I should go.

794
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:43,480
but I guess I should go.
 

795
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,710
but I guess I should go.
Well, that's not what Kachan called me, so it's a

796
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:45,720
Well, that's not what Kachan called me, so it's a
 

797
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,870
Well, that's not what Kachan called me, so it's a
competition, right? That's right,

798
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:47,880
competition, right? That's right,
 

799
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,310
competition, right? That's right,
so it's Hunting 1.  I thought for a moment that it would be better if

800
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:50,320
so it's Hunting 1.  I thought for a moment that it would be better if
 

801
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,149
so it's Hunting 1.  I thought for a moment that it would be better if
both people from the second game went to the other side,

802
00:29:53,149 --> 00:29:55,389
both people from the second game went to the other side,
 

803
00:29:55,389 --> 00:29:55,399

 

804
00:29:55,399 --> 00:29:58,630

but they are there. Even though

805
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:58,640
but they are there. Even though
 

806
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,630
but they are there. Even though
they were called over there, I guess they didn't get the message across.  It seems like

807
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:01,640
they were called over there, I guess they didn't get the message across.  It seems like
 

808
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,470
they were called over there, I guess they didn't get the message across.  It seems like

it
What's your strategy?What's going to happen to the white team

3275
01:58:59,589 --> 01:58:59,599
What's your strategy?What's going to happen to the white team
 

3276
01:58:59,599 --> 01:59:02,709
What's your strategy?What's going to happen to the white team
?Well, if you get the most successful kill, you'll

3277

?Well, if you get the most successful kill, you'll
 

3278
01:59:02,719 --> 01:59:05,910
?Well, if you get the most successful kill, you'll
get 1 point added to it.That's

3279
01:59:05,910 --> 01:59:05,920
get 1 point added to it.That's
 

3280
01:59:05,920 --> 01:59:09,350
get 1 point added to it.That's
right, I'll protect you and probably

3281
01:59:09,350 --> 01:59:09,360
right, I'll protect you and probably
 

3282
01:59:09,360 --> 01:59:12,870
right, I'll protect you and probably
focus on the opponent you want to attack.  It seems like it

3283
01:59:12,870 --> 01:59:16,390
focus on the opponent you want to attack.  It seems like it
 

3284
01:59:16,390 --> 01:59:18,109

 

3285

3286
01:59:18,119 --> 01:59:21,350

would be a good idea if we all just wake up the people who are

3287
01:59:21,350 --> 01:59:21,360

 

3288
01:59:21,360 --> 01:59:25,550

approaching that general.If you're the type, it's better to stay close to the general, but it

3289
01:59:25,550 --> 01:59:25,560
approaching that general.If you're the type, it's better to stay close to the general, but it
 

3290
01:59:25,560 --> 01:59:27,350
approaching that general.If you're the type, it's better to stay close to the general, but it
might be a good idea to keep coming closer.  It seems like a

3291
01:59:27,350 --> 01:59:27,360
might be a good idea to keep coming closer.  It seems like a
 

3292
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:30,310
might be a good idea to keep coming closer.  It seems like a
weak person.I

3293

weak person.I
 

3294
01:59:30,320 --> 01:59:33,310
weak person.I
want to beat up the weak person.I can see hearts, so I

3295
01:59:33,310 --> 01:59:33,320
want to beat up the weak person.I can see hearts, so I
 

3296
01:59:33,320 --> 01:59:35,510
want to beat up the weak person.I can see hearts, so I
might want to avoid people with 3 hearts.Conversely,

3297
01:59:35,510 --> 01:59:35,520
might want to avoid people with 3 hearts.Conversely,
 

3298
01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:40,750
might want to avoid people with 3 hearts.Conversely,
at the beginning, stay close to the general and

3299
01:59:40,750 --> 01:59:40,760
at the beginning, stay close to the general and
 

3300
01:59:40,760 --> 01:59:45,350
at the beginning, stay close to the general and
when you see 1 heart, attack him.

3301
01:59:45,350 --> 01:59:47,030

 

3302
01:59:47,030 --> 01:59:50,149

 

3303
01:59:50,149 --> 01:59:53,830

 

3304
01:59:53,830 --> 01:59:53,840

 

3305
01:59:53,840 --> 01:59:56,470

Okay, I think this will probably be the voice chat for that pair, so I guess that's right. There

3306
01:59:56,470 --> 01:59:59,790
Okay, I think this will probably be the voice chat for that pair, so I guess that's right. There

3308
01:59:59,800 --> 02:00:03,790

are so many voices. Well, I think there's probably a name at the bottom,

3309
02:00:03,790 --> 02:00:03,800
are so many voices. Well, I think there's probably a name at the bottom,
 

3310
02:00:03,800 --> 02:00:06,709

so come to think of it, it's true.

3311
02:00:06,709 --> 02:00:09,790
so come to think of it, it's true.
 

3312

Kanata says there's porridge. Minato, it's better to work together than to work together. Cooperation is bad. The general can't say "protect and protect." That's right, it's the big general. Let's do

so I guess I should go to Terutsu Cover.That's

so I guess I should go to Terutsu Cover.That's

right.When I find it, I feel
like I'm being attacked.Then I

3326
02:00:37,709 --> 02:00:37,719
like I'm being attacked.Then I
 

3327
02:00:37,719 --> 02:00:40,629
like I'm being attacked.Then I
think I'll probably have to move from now on.Everyone is moving.

think I'll probably have to move from now on.Everyone is moving.
 

3329

think I'll probably have to move from now on.Everyone is moving.
Well then, let's go. Let's go. Okay,

please, please,
 

3335

please, please,
please. For now, we'll protect the back of the large book. I'll

3337
02:00:58,239 --> 02:01:02,709
please. For now, we'll protect the back of the large book. I'll
go, but I wonder what's going to happen.

3338
02:01:02,709 --> 02:01:06,950
go, but I wonder what's going to happen.
 

3339

3340
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:10,350

Maybe he didn't turn his head, or rather, he kept his back to him. He

3345
02:01:18,199 --> 02:01:23,149
might have been facing the outside of the venue instead of toward the venue, so if you think about it
that way, you'll probably be in a different camp.

3346
02:01:23,149 --> 02:01:23,159
that way, you'll probably be in a different camp.
 

3347
02:01:23,159 --> 02:01:26,149
that way, you'll probably be in a different camp.

so it's 30 points, the white team is 20 points, and the

4694
02:51:04,429 --> 02:51:04,439
so it's 30 points, the white team is 20 points, and the
 

4695
02:51:04,439 --> 02:51:07,830
so it's 30 points, the white team is 20 points, and the
yellow team is 10 points.

This is it,
 

5244
03:11:11,560 --> 03:11:13,950
This is it,
it's a little too much, so I'm yelling at you, but I

5254
03:11:26,880 --> 03:11:30,150

To be honest, I didn't understand it at all,

5255
03:11:30,150 --> 03:11:30,160
To be honest, I didn't understand it at all,
 

5256
03:11:30,160 --> 03:11:32,030
To be honest, I didn't understand it at all,
but

5257
03:11:32,030 --> 03:11:32,040
but
 

5258
03:11:32,040 --> 03:11:35,229
but
yeah, everyone worked really hard and

5259
03:11:35,229 --> 03:11:35,239
yeah, everyone worked really hard and
 

5260
03:11:35,239 --> 03:11:38,870
yeah, everyone worked really hard and
worked really hard, and it was a close race every year, so I

5261
03:11:38,870 --> 03:11:38,880
worked really hard, and it was a close race every year, so I
 

5262
03:11:38,880 --> 03:11:41,630
worked really hard, and it was a close race every year, so I
thought it was really worth watching.

5263
03:11:41,630 --> 03:11:41,640
thought it was really worth watching.
 

5264
03:11:41,640 --> 03:11:44,790
thought it was really worth watching.

Yes, that's true, each of them
had their own drama, or rather, there was. I

think it was a drama, including the practice, but

5269
03:11:49,790 --> 03:11:49,800
think it was a drama, including the practice, but
 

5270
03:11:49,800 --> 03:11:52,790
think it was a drama, including the practice, but
yeah, I think it was really good. The

5271
03:11:52,790 --> 03:11:52,800
yeah, I think it was really good. The
 

5272
03:11:52,800 --> 03:11:55,910
