secret on Discord the goal is to have an

1754
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:18,000

answer that overlaps with another person

1756
00:53:19,849 --> 00:53:19,859
answer that overlaps with another person
 

1757
00:53:19,859 --> 00:53:23,329
answer that overlaps with another person
in the group but not too many okay

1758
00:53:23,329 --> 00:53:23,339
in the group but not too many okay
 

1759
00:53:23,339 --> 00:53:24,829
in the group but not too many okay
so

1760
00:53:24,829 --> 00:53:24,839
so
 

1761
00:53:24,839 --> 00:53:26,809
so
if you answer the same as one other girl

1762
00:53:26,809 --> 00:53:26,819
if you answer the same as one other girl
 

1763
00:53:26,819 --> 00:53:29,210
if you answer the same as one other girl
you each get two points

1764
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:29,220
you each get two points
 

1765
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:33,710
you each get two points
for example Kiara and gurase durian

1766
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:33,720
for example Kiara and gurase durian
 

1767
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:35,650
for example Kiara and gurase durian
right and then

1768
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:35,660
right and then
 

1769
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:38,630
right and then
say other answers right because you guys

1770
00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:38,640
say other answers right because you guys
 

1771
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,589
say other answers right because you guys
overlapped you get two points okay

1772
00:53:41,589 --> 00:53:41,599
overlapped you get two points okay
 

1773
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:44,329
overlapped you get two points okay
imagine though Ina also says durian

1774
00:53:44,329 --> 00:53:44,339
imagine though Ina also says durian
 

1775
00:53:44,339 --> 00:53:46,490
imagine though Ina also says durian
right that's three of you guys saying

1776
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:46,500
right that's three of you guys saying
 

1777
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,770
right that's three of you guys saying
durian so you each just get one point

1778
00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:48,780
durian so you each just get one point
 

1779
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:51,470
durian so you each just get one point
but if AMA says durian as well nobody

1780
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:51,480
but if AMA says durian as well nobody
 

1781
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:53,210
but if AMA says durian as well nobody
gets any points because you all thought

1782
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:53,220
gets any points because you all thought
 

1783
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:55,130
gets any points because you all thought
of the same thing

1784
00:53:55,130 --> 00:53:55,140
of the same thing
 

1785
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:57,349
of the same thing
so you have to find the good balance

1786
00:53:57,349 --> 00:53:57,359
so you have to find the good balance
 

1787
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:59,450
so you have to find the good balance
exactly

1788
00:53:59,450 --> 00:53:59,460
exactly
 

1789
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:02,030
exactly
so you have to be careful but also

1790
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:02,040
so you have to be careful but also
 

1791
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,490
so you have to be careful but also
having no overlap is also no point

1792
00:54:04,490 --> 00:54:04,500
having no overlap is also no point
 

1793
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:05,990
having no overlap is also no point
exactly

1794
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:06,000
exactly
 

1795
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,210
exactly
you have to try and overlap with one

1796
00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:08,220
you have to try and overlap with one
 

1797
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:10,960
you have to try and overlap with one
person

1798
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:10,970

so Kiara says
 

2257
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:02,589
so Kiara says
machine I'm a machine

2258
01:07:02,589 --> 01:07:02,599

 

2259
01:07:02,599 --> 01:07:06,710

too so I guess the three of you get a

2298
01:07:58,789 --> 01:07:58,799
too so I guess the three of you get a
 

2299
01:07:58,799 --> 01:08:01,630
too so I guess the three of you get a
point

2300
01:08:01,630 --> 01:08:01,640

 

2301
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:07,750

except except for Ina

2303
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:10,130

no everybody gets one

2304
01:08:10,130 --> 01:08:10,140
no everybody gets one
 

2305
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:12,829
no everybody gets one
yeah yeah because if everybody it's all

2306
01:08:12,829 --> 01:08:12,839
yeah yeah because if everybody it's all
 

2307
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:14,829
