to handle I like screwing him in and

2398
01:00:25,069 --> 01:00:25,079
to handle I like screwing him in and
 

2399
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:26,670
to handle I like screwing him in and
then because like you screw him in on

2400
01:00:26,670 --> 01:00:26,680
then because like you screw him in on
 

2401
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:29,190
then because like you screw him in on
one side and then you use him to connect

2402
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:29,200
one side and then you use him to connect
 

2403
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,430
one side and then you use him to connect
another thing and it just kind of works

2404
01:00:31,430 --> 01:00:31,440
another thing and it just kind of works
 

2405
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,950
another thing and it just kind of works
it just kind of [\h__\h] works and then

2406
01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:33,960
it just kind of [\h__\h] works and then
 

2407
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:35,750
it just kind of [\h__\h] works and then
and then I think like uh if I remember

2408
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:35,760
and then I think like uh if I remember
 

2409

2722
01:08:01,910 --> 01:08:01,920
incomplete version and I I kind of tried
 

2723
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:03,109
incomplete version and I I kind of tried
to show
