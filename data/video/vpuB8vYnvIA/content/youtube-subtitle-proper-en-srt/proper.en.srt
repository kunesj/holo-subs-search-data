2
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:07,558
​​<i>​ ​Lately,​ ​</i>​

3
00:00:07,558 --> 00:00:10,027
​​<i>​ ​I can't help but feel like I'm being watched...​ ​</i>​

4
00:00:10,027 --> 00:00:12,229
​​<i>​ ​It doesn't matter where I am.​ ​</i>​

5
00:00:12,229 --> 00:00:14,465
​​<i>​ ​Out shopping, working,​ ​</i>​

6
00:00:14,465 --> 00:00:16,967
​​<i>​ ​at home alone in my bath...​ ​</i>​

7
00:00:16,967 --> 00:00:22,339
​​<i>​ ​I can feel someone watching me.​ ​</i>​

8
00:00:22,339 --> 00:00:27,111
​​​ ​Hey... I've been wondering...​ ​​

9
00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:29,179
​​​ ​Have you guys felt anything​ ​​

10
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:31,682
​​​ ​weird lately?​ ​​

11
00:00:34,685 --> 00:00:35,452
​​​ ​Huh?​ ​​

12
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:36,387
​​​ ​What do you mean?​ ​​

13
00:00:36,387 --> 00:00:39,757
​​​ ​Like, more weird than normal?​ ​​

14
00:00:39,757 --> 00:00:42,259
​​​ ​Like...​ ​​

15
00:00:42,259 --> 00:00:45,696
​​​ ​Like the feeling of being watched.​ ​​

16
00:00:46,663 --> 00:00:49,666
​​​ ​Did you forget that we're idols, Bae?​ ​​

17
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:51,235
​​​ ​Of course we're being watched.​ ​​

18
00:00:51,235 --> 00:00:53,103
​​​ ​That's the point.​ ​​

19
00:00:53,103 --> 00:00:54,705
​​​ ​No, not like that...​ ​​

20
00:00:54,705 --> 00:00:57,241
​​​ ​On stage, yeah, we're being watched,​ ​​

21
00:00:57,241 --> 00:01:00,244
​​​ ​but it's not just when we're performing.​ ​​

22
00:01:00,244 --> 00:01:02,679
​​​ ​When I'm alone too, I...​ ​​

23
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:04,014
​​​ ​I don't know,​ ​​

24
00:01:04,014 --> 00:01:08,052
​​​ ​it just feels like someone is staring at me.​ ​​

25
00:01:08,052 --> 00:01:09,019
​​​ ​Hmm...​ ​​

26
00:01:09,019 --> 00:01:13,223
​​​ ​Well, having so many of us living together,​ ​​
​​ ​it would make sense, right?​ ​​

27
00:01:13,223 --> 00:01:15,726
​​​ ​It's not like we're ever really alone.​ ​​

28
00:01:15,726 --> 00:01:20,597
​​​ ​If this is about the time I walked in​ ​​
​​ ​on you in the bathroom, I'm sorry!​ ​​

29
00:01:21,698 --> 00:01:24,568
​​​ ​With her around,​ ​​
​​ ​I can understand your pain.​ ​​

30
00:01:24,568 --> 00:01:27,071
​​​ ​How many times have​ ​​
​​ ​you walked in on me again?​ ​​

31
00:01:27,071 --> 00:01:28,739
​​​ ​At this point,​ ​​

32
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:30,774
​​​ ​I have to wonder if it's intentional...​ ​​

33
00:01:30,774 --> 00:01:32,409
​​​ ​Noooo!​ ​​

34
00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:34,078
​​​ ​It's not intentional!​ ​​

35
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:35,512
​​​ ​Don't be ridiculous!​ ​​

36
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:39,516
​​​ ​Suuure, IRyS, suuure~​ ​​

37
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:42,553
​​​ ​You don't think it could be someone​ ​​
​​ ​staring through the windows, do you?​ ​​

38
00:01:42,553 --> 00:01:44,888
​​​ ​Like a stalker?​ ​​

39
00:01:44,888 --> 00:01:48,892
​​​ ​No... It's not something like that...​ ​​

40
00:01:48,892 --> 00:01:49,593
​​​ ​It's...​ ​​

41
00:01:49,593 --> 00:01:52,996
​​​ ​It's hard to explain...​ ​​

42
00:01:52,996 --> 00:01:53,764
​​​ ​Maybe...​ ​​

43
00:01:53,764 --> 00:01:56,066
​​​ ​Maybe it's nothing.​ ​​

44
00:01:56,066 --> 00:01:57,835
​​​ ​I'm sure it's nothing, Bae!​ ​​

45
00:01:57,835 --> 00:02:00,904
​​​ ​Try not to let it​ ​​
​​ ​get you down before the show!​ ​​

46
00:02:01,972 --> 00:02:04,308
​​​ ​Right, thanks.​ ​​

47
00:02:14,485 --> 00:02:17,821
​​​ ​Why are you watching me?​ ​​

48
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:22,159
​​​ ​Who are you?​ ​​

49
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,295
​​​ ​Hey... Sorry to interrupt...​ ​​

50
00:02:25,295 --> 00:02:27,531
​​​ ​The driver's waiting outside.​ ​​

51
00:02:27,531 --> 00:02:32,903
​​​ ​Ahh, yeah, just a minute...​ ​​

52
00:02:33,604 --> 00:02:34,838
​​​ ​Hey, Bae?​ ​​

53
00:02:34,838 --> 00:02:36,907
​​​ ​Is everything okay?​ ​​

54
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:41,645
​​​ ​You don't have to hide it from me...​ ​​

55
00:02:41,645 --> 00:02:44,047
​​​ ​Uh, yeah...​ ​​

56
00:02:44,047 --> 00:02:45,549
​​​ ​It's...​ ​​

57
00:02:45,549 --> 00:02:46,049
​​​ ​I don't know...​ ​​

58
00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:48,018
​​​ ​I feel like I'm going crazy...​ ​​

59
00:02:48,952 --> 00:02:52,222
​​​ ​Even right now...​ ​​
​​ ​It feels like someone is watching...​ ​​

60
00:02:52,222 --> 00:02:54,558
​​​ ​Not you, someone else...​ ​​

61
00:02:54,558 --> 00:02:56,426
​​​ ​I believe you, man.​ ​​

62
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:59,196
​​​ ​Hey, if you want to​ ​​
​​ ​cancel the show tonight, it's okay...​ ​​

63
00:02:59,196 --> 00:03:00,397
​​​ ​I can talk to our manager and...​ ​​

64
00:03:00,397 --> 00:03:02,266
​​​ ​No no no,​ ​​

65
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:04,535
​​​ ​it's okay...​ ​​

66
00:03:04,535 --> 00:03:06,203
​​​ ​Let's just go...​ ​​

67
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,143
​​​ ​How do you style your hair with these horns?​ ​​

68
00:03:13,143 --> 00:03:15,112
​​​ ​I don't.​ ​​

69
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:17,014
​​​ ​Remove them for me?​ ​​

70
00:03:17,014 --> 00:03:17,981
​​​ ​Ehh?!​ ​​

71
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:20,450
​​​ ​You want me to remove them?​ ​​

72
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,320
​​​ ​First of all, I don't even know how to do that.​ ​​

73
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:28,659
​​​ ​Second of all, you should be happy to have​ ​​
​​ ​such great weapons attached to your head!​ ​​

74
00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:30,093
​​​ ​Weapons, hm?​ ​​

75
00:03:30,093 --> 00:03:32,262
​​​ ​I never thought of it like that...​ ​​

76
00:03:32,262 --> 00:03:34,431
​​​ ​Okay, I guess I'll keep them.​ ​​

77
00:03:34,431 --> 00:03:36,934
​​​ ​Can I wear one of your hats?​ ​​

78
00:03:36,934 --> 00:03:39,236
​​​ ​Oi, I need these!​ ​​

79
00:03:39,236 --> 00:03:41,638
​​​ ​Here, I'll give you twin buns.​ ​​

80
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,774
​​​ ​Something cute for IWyS~​ ​​

81
00:03:43,774 --> 00:03:45,976
​​​ ​Kiwawa~​ ​​

82
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:48,512
​​​ ​Ladies, it's time.​ ​​

83
00:03:48,512 --> 00:03:49,279
​​​ ​Already?!​ ​​

84
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:51,682
​​​ ​Let's do this, girls.​ ​​

85
00:04:23,814 --> 00:04:28,652
​​​ ​Calli... What happened?​ ​​

86
00:04:29,886 --> 00:04:32,556
​​​ ​I don't want you to​ ​​
​​ ​worry about that anymore...​ ​​

87
00:04:32,556 --> 00:04:35,592
​​​ ​Everything is going to be okay now.​ ​​

88
00:04:37,394 --> 00:04:41,898
​​​ ​H-Hey, are you okay?!​ ​​
​​ ​You're bleeding!​ ​​

89
00:04:41,898 --> 00:04:45,736
​​​ ​Oh, this?​ ​​

90
00:04:45,736 --> 00:04:47,204
​​​ ​I...​ ​​

91
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:50,307
​​​ ​I just wanted to make sure you'd be okay...​ ​​

92
00:04:50,307 --> 00:04:55,279
​​​ ​That you wouldn't feel watched anymore...​ ​​

93
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:59,983
​​​ ​What? What did you do?​ ​​

94
00:05:02,586 --> 00:05:10,694
​​​ ​I got rid of them all... For you...​ ​​

95
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:21,271
​​​ ​Why are you still watching?​ ​​
