4249
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:55,970
the product to be created maybe
um

4250
01:59:55,970 --> 01:59:55,980
um
 

4251
01:59:55,980 --> 01:59:58,550
um
I can imagine that that's maybe why they

4252
01:59:58,550 --> 01:59:58,560
I can imagine that that's maybe why they
 

4253
01:59:58,560 --> 02:00:02,030
I can imagine that that's maybe why they
do it like that

4254
02:00:02,030 --> 02:00:02,040

 

4255
02:00:02,040 --> 02:00:03,709

okay measurements I think it depends

4256
02:00:03,709 --> 02:00:03,719
okay measurements I think it depends
 

4257
02:00:03,719 --> 02:00:05,689
okay measurements I think it depends
because there's

4258
02:00:05,689 --> 02:00:05,699
because there's
 

4259
02:00:05,699 --> 02:00:07,790
because there's
several

4260
02:00:07,790 --> 02:00:07,800
several
 

4261
02:00:07,800 --> 02:00:11,089
several
like one I think the most uh high-end

4262
02:00:11,089 --> 02:00:11,099
like one I think the most uh high-end
 

4263
02:00:11,099 --> 02:00:13,010
like one I think the most uh high-end
expensive one is like a full body suit

4264
02:00:13,010 --> 02:00:13,020
expensive one is like a full body suit
 

4265
02:00:13,020 --> 02:00:15,169
expensive one is like a full body suit
but then they have others where it's

4266
02:00:15,169 --> 02:00:15,179
but then they have others where it's
 

4267
02:00:15,179 --> 02:00:17,510
but then they have others where it's
just straps it's not even a suit it's

4268
02:00:17,510 --> 02:00:17,520
just straps it's not even a suit it's
 

4269
02:00:17,520 --> 02:00:21,350
just straps it's not even a suit it's
straps and it's still looking so good

4270
02:00:21,350 --> 02:00:21,360
straps and it's still looking so good
 

4271
02:00:21,360 --> 02:00:23,649
straps and it's still looking so good
um

4272
02:00:23,649 --> 02:00:23,659

 

4273
02:00:23,659 --> 02:00:26,689

I really wonder

4274
02:00:26,689 --> 02:00:26,699
I really wonder
 

4275
02:00:26,699 --> 02:00:30,350
I really wonder
because I'm comparing it like in theory

4276
02:00:30,350 --> 02:00:30,360
because I'm comparing it like in theory
 

4277
02:00:30,360 --> 02:00:32,089
because I'm comparing it like in theory
it's just

4278
02:00:32,089 --> 02:00:32,099
it's just
 

4279
02:00:32,099 --> 02:00:34,370
it's just
a much improved version of what we

4280
02:00:34,370 --> 02:00:34,380
a much improved version of what we
 

4281
02:00:34,380 --> 02:00:37,430
a much improved version of what we

have seen on on Twitter yeah they felt
like revealing it

13055
06:01:40,190 --> 06:01:40,200
like revealing it
 

13056
06:01:40,200 --> 06:01:42,770
like revealing it
the other units that are not on the

13057
06:01:42,770 --> 06:01:42,780
the other units that are not on the
 

13058
06:01:42,780 --> 06:01:44,448
the other units that are not on the
website I don't understand why someone

13059
06:01:44,448 --> 06:01:44,458
website I don't understand why someone
 

13060
06:01:44,458 --> 06:01:47,150
website I don't understand why someone
somewhere on the website and somewhere I

13061
06:01:47,150 --> 06:01:47,160
somewhere on the website and somewhere I
 

13062
06:01:47,160 --> 06:01:50,150
somewhere on the website and somewhere I
don't understand like how why

13063
06:01:50,150 --> 06:01:50,160
don't understand like how why
 

13064
06:01:50,160 --> 06:01:53,330
don't understand like how why
where is the difference but yeah

13065
06:01:53,330 --> 06:01:53,340
where is the difference but yeah
 

13066
06:01:53,340 --> 06:01:55,730
where is the difference but yeah
maybe maybe because it's not a real unit

13067
06:01:55,730 --> 06:01:55,740
maybe maybe because it's not a real unit
 

13068
06:01:55,740 --> 06:01:57,110
maybe maybe because it's not a real unit
and all the units that were on the

13069
06:01:57,110 --> 06:01:57,120
and all the units that were on the
 

13070
06:01:57,120 --> 06:02:02,350
and all the units that were on the
website are official units I guess

13071
06:02:02,350 --> 06:02:02,360
website are official units I guess
 

13072
06:02:02,360 --> 06:02:05,628
website are official units I guess
because it was umisi like every all the

13073
06:02:05,628 --> 06:02:05,638
because it was umisi like every all the
 

13074
06:02:05,638 --> 06:02:08,030
because it was umisi like every all the
units that are like actively releasing

13075
06:02:08,030 --> 06:02:08,040
units that are like actively releasing
 

13076
06:02:08,040 --> 06:02:10,620
units that are like actively releasing
music I guess

13077
06:02:10,620 --> 06:02:10,630

13078
06:02:10,630 --> 06:02:11,868

um
 

13082
06:02:13,378 --> 06:02:16,070
um
probably that's the difference yeah and

13083
06:02:16,070 --> 06:02:16,080
probably that's the difference yeah and
 

13084
06:02:16,080 --> 06:02:18,410
probably that's the difference yeah and
I love everybody's reaction was like it

13085
06:02:18,410 --> 06:02:18,420
I love everybody's reaction was like it
 

13086
06:02:18,420 --> 06:02:20,990
I love everybody's reaction was like it
was second still alive like the Japanese

13087
06:02:20,990 --> 06:02:21,000
was second still alive like the Japanese
 

13088
06:02:21,000 --> 06:02:24,048
was second still alive like the Japanese
people's reactions were like

13089
06:02:24,048 --> 06:02:24,058
people's reactions were like
 

13090
06:02:24,058 --> 06:02:27,048
people's reactions were like
still operating what

13091
06:02:27,048 --> 06:02:27,058
still operating what
 

13092
06:02:27,058 --> 06:02:33,110
still operating what
I totally saw that coming

13093
06:02:33,110 --> 06:02:33,120

 

13094
06:02:33,120 --> 06:02:37,970

yeah usaken but I actually I suggested

13095
06:02:37,970 --> 06:02:37,980
yeah usaken but I actually I suggested
 

13096
06:02:37,980 --> 06:02:39,530
yeah usaken but I actually I suggested
that

13097
06:02:39,530 --> 06:02:39,540
that
 

13098
06:02:39,540 --> 06:02:41,750
that
oh yeah they did Homo X for a unit too

13099
06:02:41,750 --> 06:02:41,760
oh yeah they did Homo X for a unit too
 

13100
06:02:41,760 --> 06:02:45,590
oh yeah they did Homo X for a unit too
that's it I don't know I don't know what

13101
06:02:45,590 --> 06:02:45,600
that's it I don't know I don't know what
 

13102
06:02:45,600 --> 06:02:48,230
that's it I don't know I don't know what
the logic is but yeah I suggested that

13103
06:02:48,230 --> 06:02:48,240
the logic is but yeah I suggested that
 

13104
06:02:48,240 --> 06:02:51,650
the logic is but yeah I suggested that
we maybe do a collab with us again

13105
06:02:51,650 --> 06:02:51,660
we maybe do a collab with us again
 

13106
06:02:51,660 --> 06:02:54,770
we maybe do a collab with us again
before the concert so that it would make

13107
06:02:54,770 --> 06:02:54,780
before the concert so that it would make
 

13108
06:02:54,780 --> 06:02:59,090
before the concert so that it would make
more sense but I thought I could create

13109
06:02:59,090 --> 06:02:59,100
more sense but I thought I could create
 

13110
06:02:59,100 --> 06:03:04,610
more sense but I thought I could create
kind of a timeline you know uh naturally

13111
06:03:04,610 --> 06:03:04,620
kind of a timeline you know uh naturally
 

13112
06:03:04,620 --> 06:03:07,610
kind of a timeline you know uh naturally
but I was thinking that people wouldn't

13113
06:03:07,610 --> 06:03:07,620
but I was thinking that people wouldn't
 

13114
06:03:07,620 --> 06:03:11,030
but I was thinking that people wouldn't
know that usagan would be performing and

13115
06:03:11,030 --> 06:03:11,040
know that usagan would be performing and
 

13116
06:03:11,040 --> 06:03:12,110
know that usagan would be performing and
thus

13117
06:03:12,110 --> 06:03:12,120
thus
 

13118
06:03:12,120 --> 06:03:14,810
thus
you know it would make more sense but

13119
06:03:14,810 --> 06:03:14,820
you know it would make more sense but
 

13120
06:03:14,820 --> 06:03:17,330
you know it would make more sense but
now people know so it will feel kind of

13121
06:03:17,330 --> 06:03:17,340
now people know so it will feel kind of
 

13122
06:03:17,340 --> 06:03:19,548
now people know so it will feel kind of
staged if we do the collab

13123
06:03:19,548 --> 06:03:19,558
staged if we do the collab
 

13124
06:03:19,558 --> 06:03:22,250
staged if we do the collab
that wasn't according to keikaku but we

13125
06:03:22,250 --> 06:03:22,260
that wasn't according to keikaku but we
 

13126
06:03:22,260 --> 06:03:24,708
that wasn't according to keikaku but we
should still do it yeah

13127
06:03:24,708 --> 06:03:24,718
should still do it yeah
 

13128
06:03:24,718 --> 06:03:26,330
should still do it yeah
I said it doesn't even have to be

13129
06:03:26,330 --> 06:03:26,340
I said it doesn't even have to be
 

13130
06:03:26,340 --> 06:03:29,930
I said it doesn't even have to be
Minecraft but uh yeah I suggested to

13131
06:03:29,930 --> 06:03:29,940
Minecraft but uh yeah I suggested to
 

13132
06:03:29,940 --> 06:03:32,930
Minecraft but uh yeah I suggested to
everybody almost like in order to make

13133
06:03:32,930 --> 06:03:32,940
everybody almost like in order to make
 

13134
06:03:32,940 --> 06:03:35,690
everybody almost like in order to make
it a bit more natural maybe we should do

13135
06:03:35,690 --> 06:03:35,700
it a bit more natural maybe we should do
 

13136
06:03:35,700 --> 06:03:37,730
it a bit more natural maybe we should do
a collab together before the concert and

13137
06:03:37,730 --> 06:03:37,740
a collab together before the concert and
 

13138
06:03:37,740 --> 06:03:39,830
a collab together before the concert and
they were like yeah okay interesting

13139
06:03:39,830 --> 06:03:39,840
