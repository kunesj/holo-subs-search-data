350 honestly you know what let's go
check the uh

11118
05:43:17,548 --> 05:43:17,558
check the uh
 

11119
05:43:17,558 --> 05:43:21,590
check the uh
enchantment

11120
05:43:21,590 --> 05:43:21,600

 

11121
05:43:21,600 --> 05:43:24,190

right I have the lapis I think I left

11127
05:43:33,000 --> 05:43:40,110

uh efficiency two still

11128
05:43:40,110 --> 05:43:40,120

 

11129
05:43:40,120 --> 05:43:42,670

efficiency

11130
05:43:42,670 --> 05:43:42,680
efficiency
 

11131
05:43:42,680 --> 05:43:48,750
efficiency
one I guess I could try go

11132
05:43:48,750 --> 05:43:48,760

 

11133
05:43:48,760 --> 05:43:50,910

for I should have just I should just

11134
05:43:50,910 --> 05:43:50,920
for I should have just I should just
 

11135
05:43:50,920 --> 05:43:58,350
for I should have just I should just
leave lapis

11136
05:43:58,350 --> 05:43:58,360

 

11137
05:43:58,360 --> 05:44:01,150

here if you combine two golden shovels

11138
05:44:01,150 --> 05:44:01,160
here if you combine two golden shovels
 

11139
05:44:01,160 --> 05:44:02,830
here if you combine two golden shovels
with efficiency two you can get

11140
05:44:02,830 --> 05:44:02,840
with efficiency two you can get
 

11141
05:44:02,840 --> 05:44:07,880
with efficiency two you can get
efficiency three that is true

11142
05:44:07,880 --> 05:44:07,890

 

11143
05:44:07,890 --> 05:44:12,708

probably some them are repeatable and or
some of them are you know not a whole

11158
05:44:34,750 --> 05:44:34,760
some of them are you know not a whole
 

11159
05:44:34,760 --> 05:44:36,030
some of them are you know not a whole
rush
