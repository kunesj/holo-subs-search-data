4247
01:50:45,960 --> 01:50:49,550

ladies nobody wants robotics no the

4248
01:50:49,550 --> 01:50:49,560
ladies nobody wants robotics no the
 

4249
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:52,830

01:50:57,390 --> 01:50:57,400
tons of robotic magazines cuz no one
 

4255
01:50:57,400 --> 01:51:00,189
tons of robotic magazines cuz no one
wants to learn it

4256
01:51:00,189 --> 01:51:00,199
wants to learn it
 

4257
01:51:00,199 --> 01:51:02,550

there's still stuff to organiz it's okay

4348
01:53:12,149 --> 01:53:12,159
there's still stuff to organiz it's okay
 

4349
01:53:12,159 --> 01:53:14,510
there's still stuff to organiz it's okay
it's okay you can do next time next time

4350
01:53:14,510 --> 01:53:14,520
it's okay you can do next time next time
 

4351
01:53:14,520 --> 01:53:16,270
it's okay you can do next time next time
it's okay and once the raid is over

4352
01:53:16,270 --> 01:53:16,280
it's okay and once the raid is over
 

4353
01:53:16,280 --> 01:53:18,149
it's okay and once the raid is over
we'll still you know can go on for like

4354
01:53:18,149 --> 01:53:18,159
we'll still you know can go on for like
 

4355
01:53:18,159 --> 01:53:20,870
we'll still you know can go on for like
a tiny bit longer I think but I I won't

4356
01:53:20,870 --> 01:53:20,880
a tiny bit longer I think but I I won't
 

4357
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:23,830
a tiny bit longer I think but I I won't
I have a different stream I'm doing but

4358
01:53:23,830 --> 01:53:23,840
I have a different stream I'm doing but
 

4359
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:25,669
I have a different stream I'm doing but
okay yeah if you want to stick around I

4360
01:53:25,669 --> 01:53:25,679
okay yeah if you want to stick around I
 

4361
01:53:25,679 --> 01:53:26,990
okay yeah if you want to stick around I
think that having the server open for

4362
01:53:26,990 --> 01:53:27,000
think that having the server open for
 

4363
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:30,790
think that having the server open for
like a couple more hours is probably

4364
01:53:30,790 --> 01:53:30,800

 

4365
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:33,030

okay we just have to keep track of when

4366
01:53:33,030 --> 01:53:33,040
okay we just have to keep track of when
 

4367
01:53:33,040 --> 01:53:35,669
okay we just have to keep track of when
the raid is going to happen you know
