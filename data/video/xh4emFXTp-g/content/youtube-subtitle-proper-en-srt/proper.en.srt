00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:06,390
​​​ ​I'd like to hear about​ ​​
​​ ​today's special at KFP.​ ​​

5
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:06,924
​​​ ​What?!​ ​​

​​​ ​Anyway, good morning!​ ​​

15
00:00:21,972 --> 00:00:23,173
​​​ ​I'm Shishiro Botan.​ ​​

16
00:00:23,407 --> 00:00:25,943
​​​ ​And here I am in a video​ ​​
​​ ​on the main channel​ ​​

17
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:28,012
​​​ ​doing the opening all by myself.​ ​​

18
00:00:28,012 --> 00:00:31,949
​​​ ​This is giving me a bit of anxiety here.​ ​​

19
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,852
​​​ ​Well, to explain what we're doing today,​ ​​

20
00:00:34,852 --> 00:00:37,221
​​​ ​it's an official surprise call program!​ ​​

21
00:00:37,221 --> 00:00:38,288
​​​ ​Yay!​ ​​

​​​ ​A-chan​ ​​

32
00:00:58,242 --> 00:00:59,543
​​<b>​ ​But!!​ ​</b>​

33
00:00:59,543 --> 00:01:02,613
​​​ ​Actually, these aren't​ ​​
​​ ​regular surprise calls!​ ​​

34
00:01:02,613 --> 00:01:07,151
​​​ ​We told these three in advance​ ​​
​​ ​that they'd get a call today!​ ​​

35
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:11,955
​​​ ​They're ready and waiting​ ​​
​​ ​to have a little fun with the call!​ ​​

36
00:01:11,955 --> 00:01:18,962
​​​ ​A-chan​ ​​

37
00:01:12,222 --> 00:01:13,190
​​​ ​And also!​ ​​

38
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:17,661
​​​ ​Botan has been acting like she doesn't know​ ​​
​​ ​anything about this, but she does!​ ​​

39
00:01:18,262 --> 00:01:18,629
​​​ ​Basically...​ ​​

40
00:01:19,096 --> 00:01:21,432
​​​ ​it's all a put-on!​ ​​

41
00:01:21,432 --> 00:01:24,835
​​​ ​Now then, how will these surprise calls go?!​ ​​

42
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:29,506
​​​ ​Okay! Who's our​ ​​
​​ ​very special first participant?​ ​​

43
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,877
​​​ ​It's 4th Gen's Tsunomaki Watame!​ ​​

44
00:01:33,877 --> 00:01:35,746
​​​ ​Watame-senpai is first.​ ​​

45
00:01:35,746 --> 00:01:37,247
​​​ ​I wonder what she's up to.​ ​​

46
00:01:37,247 --> 00:01:39,817
​​​ ​Let's give her a call!​ ​​

47
00:01:39,817 --> 00:01:42,619
​​​ ​Surprise call starts now!​ ​​

48
00:01:44,288 --> 00:01:45,189
​​​ ​Exciting.​ ​​

49
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:47,057
​​​ ​I really do wonder what's she doing.​ ​​

50
00:01:47,057 --> 00:01:48,559
​​​ ​Excitement. Excitement!​ ​​

51
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,028
​​​ ​Hello?​ ​​

52
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:52,262
​​​ ​Hey!​ ​​

53
00:01:52,262 --> 00:01:53,330
​​​ ​How are you doing?​ ​​

54
00:01:52,796 --> 00:01:55,232
​​​ ​I'm good!​ ​​

55
00:01:54,331 --> 00:01:57,534
​​​ ​Yeah? What are you up to right now?​ ​​

56
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:00,337
​​​ ​I was just about to get in the bath.​ ​​

57
00:02:00,337 --> 00:02:01,405
​​​ ​You're gonna take a bath?​ ​​

58
00:02:01,405 --> 00:02:02,673
​​​ ​Right in front of me?​ ​​

59
00:02:01,972 --> 00:02:03,107
​​​ ​Yeah.​ ​​

60
00:02:02,673 --> 00:02:03,607
​​​ ​You sure about that?​ ​​

61
00:02:03,607 --> 00:02:04,575
​​​ ​Where are you?​ ​​

62
00:02:04,575 --> 00:02:06,710
​​​ ​Getting in the bath, so at home?​ ​​

63
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,145
​​​ ​No, I'm not.​ ​​

64
00:02:08,145 --> 00:02:10,280
​​​ ​I'm at a hot spring!​ ​​

65
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,915
​​​ ​I'm naked as a jaybird right now.​ ​​

66
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,915
​​​ ​Really?​ ​​

67
00:02:11,915 --> 00:02:13,450
​​​ ​I'm gonna get in now, okay?​ ​​

68
00:02:11,915 --> 00:02:13,450
​​​ ​You're naked?!​ ​​

69
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:14,985
​​​ ​Oh, sure.​ ​​

70
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:15,452
​​​ ​Yeah, can I?​ ​​

71
00:02:15,452 --> 00:02:16,420
​​​ ​I'm gonna hop in.​ ​​

72
00:02:15,786 --> 00:02:16,420
​​​ ​Sure.​ ​​

73
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,888
​​<i>​ ​Splash!​ ​</i>​

74
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:20,457
​​​ ​Hey, did you rinse yourself first?!​ ​​

75
00:02:20,457 --> 00:02:21,859
​​​ ​Huh? Do what now?​ ​​

76
00:02:21,859 --> 00:02:24,261
​​​ ​You gotta rinse yourself before you get in!​ ​​

77
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:23,460
​​​ ​What now?​ ​​

78
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:27,364
​​​ ​Bath Manners​ ​​
​​ ​Before you get in, use a bucket of hot water​ ​​
​​ ​to rinse your body of excess dirt.​ ​​

79
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:27,364
​​​ ​You gotta rinse your body to​ ​​
​​ ​get rid of dirt before you get in!​ ​​

80
00:02:27,364 --> 00:02:30,000
​​​ ​This hot spring's kinda brown and murky.​ ​​

81
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,801
​​​ ​It says...​ ​​

82
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,702
​​​ ​Oh, one of those.​ ​​

83
00:02:30,801 --> 00:02:31,702
​​​ ​Ow!​ ​​

84
00:02:31,702 --> 00:02:33,337
​​​ ​Hot!​ ​​

85
00:02:33,337 --> 00:02:34,705
​​​ ​It's... huh?​ ​​

86
00:02:34,705 --> 00:02:35,839
​​​ ​What?​ ​​

87
00:02:35,839 --> 00:02:37,741
​​​ ​This hot spring is <i>​really </i>hot!​ ​​

88
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:40,310
​​​ ​There are green onions​ ​​
​​ ​and stuff in here! Weird!​ ​​

89
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,678
​​​ ​Sounds like a boiling issue.​ ​​

90
00:02:41,678 --> 00:02:43,013
​​​ ​Is there anything else in there?​ ​​

91
00:02:43,013 --> 00:02:43,580
​​​ ​Let's see.​ ​​

92
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,182
​​​ ​Tofu...​ ​​

93
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:46,350
​​​ ​Okay.​ ​​

94
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,118
​​​ ​Shirataki noodles...​ ​​

95
00:02:48,118 --> 00:02:49,119
​​​ ​Shirataki noodles?​ ​​

96
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:51,155
​​​ ​Are the benefits of the hot spring written?​ ​​

97
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,155
​​​ ​Yeah.​ ​​

98
00:02:51,155 --> 00:02:56,026
​​​ ​- Health Benefits -​ ​​

99
00:02:51,155 --> 00:02:53,991
​​​ ​Highly nutritious.​ ​​

100
00:02:53,991 --> 00:02:56,026
​​​ ​Packed with protein.​ ​​

101
00:02:56,026 --> 00:02:57,327
​​​ ​- Health Benefits -​ ​​

102
00:02:56,026 --> 00:02:58,395
​​​ ​Highly nutritious...​ ​​

103
00:02:56,793 --> 00:02:59,096
​​​ ​Weird, huh?​ ​​

104
00:02:57,494 --> 00:02:59,096
​​​ ​- Watame Stew -​ ​​

105
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:00,631
​​​ ​Wait, ain't this a stew?!​ ​​

106
00:03:00,631 --> 00:03:02,699
​​​ ​The protein they mentioned...​ ​​

107
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:04,034
​​​ ​they probably mean you.​ ​​

108
00:03:04,034 --> 00:03:05,002
​​​ ​Oh my god!​ ​​

109
00:03:05,002 --> 00:03:06,103
​​​ ​Yeah, I'm getting out!​ ​​

110
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:07,304
​​​ ​Out!​ ​​

111
00:03:06,537 --> 00:03:07,304
​​​ ​Yeah, get out!​ ​​

112
00:03:07,304 --> 00:03:08,872
​​​ ​I'm outta here!​ ​​

113
00:03:07,304 --> 00:03:08,872
​​​ ​You're in trouble.​ ​​

114
00:03:08,872 --> 00:03:11,408
​​​ ​I think I got a little bit scalded.​ ​​

115
00:03:11,408 --> 00:03:12,376
​​​ ​I bet.​ ​​

116
00:03:11,408 --> 00:03:13,477
​​​ ​My body's stinging a bit.​ ​​

117
00:03:14,478 --> 00:03:16,547
​​​ ​Can I dry my hair now?​ ​​

118
00:03:16,547 --> 00:03:17,281
​​​ ​Oh, sure.​ ​​

119
00:03:16,813 --> 00:03:18,248
​​​ ​It's soaking wet.​ ​​

120
00:03:18,248 --> 00:03:19,516
​​​ ​The way this is going​ ​​

121
00:03:19,516 --> 00:03:20,751
​​​ ​I'm expecting some sear marks.​ ​​

122
00:03:20,751 --> 00:03:22,119
​​​ ​Everything should be fine now.​ ​​

123
00:03:24,054 --> 00:03:25,589
​​​ ​Ow ow ow ow!​ ​​

124
00:03:25,589 --> 00:03:28,292
​​​ ​Is that actually a hair dryer?​ ​​

125
00:03:25,689 --> 00:03:27,124
​​​ ​Oww!​ ​​

126
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:30,227
​​​ ​I don't think it is.​ ​​

127
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:31,361
​​​ ​This is different from​ ​​
​​ ​any hair dryer I know!​ ​​

128
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:32,396
​​​ ​Ow ow ow ow!​ ​​

129
00:03:32,396 --> 00:03:33,630
​​​ ​This thing's a blowtorch!​ ​​

130
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:35,832
​​​ ​For cooking​ ​​

131
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,832
​​​ ​It's a blowtorch! A blowtorch!​ ​​

132
00:03:35,832 --> 00:03:38,702
​​​ ​(the sound of meat sizzling)​ ​​

133
00:03:35,832 --> 00:03:38,068
​​​ ​You really are getting sear marks!​ ​​

134
00:03:35,832 --> 00:03:38,702
​​​ ​Blowtorch! Owwie!​ ​​

135
00:03:38,702 --> 00:03:40,537
​​​ ​Anything weird with your body right now?​ ​​

136
00:03:41,271 --> 00:03:43,240
​​​ ​Anything weird?​ ​​

137
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,978
​​​ ​It's getting harder to move, I think.​ ​​

138
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:49,346
​​​ ​Crispy texture achieved.​ ​​

139
00:03:49,346 --> 00:03:51,715
​​​ ​You're on the verge of becoming a meal.​ ​​

140
00:03:51,715 --> 00:03:56,186
​​​ ​There's a plate on this conveyor belt, so I'm​ ​​
​​ ​gonna get on that and head over your way.​ ​​

141
00:03:56,186 --> 00:03:58,021
​​​ ​Really? I'll await your arrival.​ ​​

142
00:03:57,521 --> 00:03:58,021
​​​ ​Okay.​ ​​

143
00:03:58,021 --> 00:03:59,489
​​​ ​What a crazy place to be in.​ ​​

144
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,025
​​​ ​A food processing plant.​ ​​

145
00:04:02,025 --> 00:04:04,127
​​​ ​I'm back!​ ​​

146
00:04:04,127 --> 00:04:06,196
​​​ ​You were at a hot spring?​ ​​

147
00:04:06,196 --> 00:04:07,297
​​​ ​Sure was.​ ​​

148
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:10,634
​​​ ​More like sure wasn't!​ ​​

149
00:04:12,302 --> 00:04:15,272
​​​ ​And that's the end of the surprise call!​ ​​

150
00:04:15,272 --> 00:04:17,207
​​​ ​Now Watame-senpai is here!​ ​​

151
00:04:17,207 --> 00:04:18,075
​​​ ​How was it?​ ​​

152
00:04:18,075 --> 00:04:20,077
​​​ ​What's your rating?​ ​​

153
00:04:20,077 --> 00:04:22,246
​​​ ​60 out of 100, I guess?​ ​​

154
00:04:21,778 --> 00:04:22,779
​​​ ​That low?​ ​​

155
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:24,615
​​​ ​Lower than I thought!​ ​​

156
00:04:23,313 --> 00:04:25,515
​​​ ​A sixty, I'd say.​ ​​

157
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:26,717
​​​ ​It's a tough one.​ ​​

158
00:04:26,717 --> 00:04:27,384
​​​ ​I mean,​ ​​

159
00:04:27,384 --> 00:04:29,486
​​​ ​I'm an idol,​ ​​

160
00:04:29,486 --> 00:04:33,824
​​​ ​so having to act like a comedian​ ​​
​​ ​wasn't in my plans.​ ​​

161
00:04:33,824 --> 00:04:36,226
​​​ ​What? I thought you were a meal.​ ​​

162
00:04:36,226 --> 00:04:38,795
​​​ ​You went there?!​ ​​

163
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:43,533
​​​ ​The next surprise call is going to...​ ​​

164
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:47,871
​​​ ​Airani Iofifteen from hololive ID!​ ​​

165
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:50,440
​​​ ​Ohh! Iofi!​ ​​

166
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,011
​​​ ​You do a lot of collabs with​ ​​
​​ ​Iofi-senpai, don't you, Watame?​ ​​

167
00:04:54,011 --> 00:04:54,978
​​​ ​Yeah!​ ​​

168
00:04:54,978 --> 00:04:57,147
​​​ ​What is Iofi-senpai normally like?​ ​​

169
00:04:57,147 --> 00:04:59,149
​​​ ​She's cute.​ ​​

170
00:04:59,149 --> 00:05:00,083
​​​ ​Cute, huh?​ ​​

171
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:03,787
​​​ ​I wonder if we'll see that cuteness today,​ ​​
​​ ​when we surprise call her.​ ​​

172
00:05:03,787 --> 00:05:05,055
​​​ ​Let's go!​ ​​

173
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:07,724
​​​ ​Let's see what Iofi-senpai is up to.​ ​​

174
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,160
​​​ ​Surprise call starts now!​ ​​

175
00:05:11,461 --> 00:05:14,131
​​​ ​Ring ring ring ring! Ring ring ring!​ ​​

176
00:05:14,131 --> 00:05:15,232
​​​ ​Ring ring!​ ​​

177
00:05:15,966 --> 00:05:16,800
​​​ ​Ring ring!​ ​​

178
00:05:15,966 --> 00:05:16,800
​​​ ​Oh?​ ​​

179
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,402
​​​ ​Huh? Who's this?​ ​​

180
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:19,436
​​​ ​At this hour?​ ​​

181
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:19,436
​​​ ​Hello!​ ​​

182
00:05:19,436 --> 00:05:22,005
​​​ ​Is this Iofi-senpai?​ ​​

183
00:05:22,005 --> 00:05:22,673
​​​ ​Yeah!​ ​​

184
00:05:22,673 --> 00:05:25,909
​​​ ​It's me, the biggest brain alien, Iofi.​ ​​

185
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,678
​​​ ​Whatcha need?​ ​​

186
00:05:26,343 --> 00:05:27,277
​​​ ​Hello.​ ​​

187
00:05:27,678 --> 00:05:31,248
​​​ ​This is Shishiro Botan​ ​​
​​ ​with Tsunomaki Watame.​ ​​

188
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:32,749
​​​ ​Oh, you two!​ ​​

189
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,251
​​​ ​It's been a while!​ ​​

190
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,253
​​​ ​Yes, it has!​ ​​

191
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,789
​​​ ​Iofi-senpai, what are you up to right now?​ ​​

192
00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:39,923
​​​ ​Right now?​ ​​

193
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:42,192
​​​ ​I'm taking a little drive.​ ​​

194
00:05:42,192 --> 00:05:43,627
​​​ ​A drive?!​ ​​

195
00:05:43,627 --> 00:05:44,995
​​​ ​A drive...​ ​​

196
00:05:44,127 --> 00:05:44,995
​​​ ​Yep.​ ​​

197
00:05:45,395 --> 00:05:46,997
​​​ ​Where are you driving to?​ ​​

198
00:05:46,997 --> 00:05:47,764
​​​ ​Space.​ ​​

199
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:50,834
​​​ ​Driving in space...​ ​​

200
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:50,834
​​​ ​It's very pretty.​ ​​

201
00:05:50,834 --> 00:05:53,103
​​​ ​I'm driving my UFO right now.​ ​​

202
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:55,572
​​​ ​Oh, that's so romantic!​ ​​

203
00:05:53,904 --> 00:05:55,572
​​​ ​Wow!​ ​​

204
00:05:55,572 --> 00:05:56,606
​​​ ​Do you have a driver's license?​ ​​

205
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,075
​​​ ​Do you need a license for a UFO?​ ​​

206
00:05:58,075 --> 00:05:59,076
​​​ ​I do!​ ​​

207
00:05:59,076 --> 00:05:59,776
​​​ ​You need one!​ ​​

208
00:05:59,076 --> 00:06:00,410
​​​ ​Oh, you do.​ ​​

209
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,845
​​​ ​So you need a license!​ ​​

210
00:06:01,845 --> 00:06:03,547
​​​ ​Seems so.​ ​​

211
00:06:01,845 --> 00:06:02,779
​​​ ​Definitely.​ ​​

212
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,749
​​​ ​I'd say it's harder to drive than a normal car.​ ​​

213
00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:07,818
​​​ ​Oh, like a special heavy vehicle license?​ ​​

214
00:06:07,818 --> 00:06:09,753
​​​ ​You probably don't know that.​ ​​

215
00:06:09,753 --> 00:06:11,388
​​​ ​What's a special heavy vehicle license?​ ​​

216
00:06:10,987 --> 00:06:14,991
​​​ ​Special Large Motor Vehicle License level?​ ​​

217
00:06:10,987 --> 00:06:14,991
​​​ ​Medium​ ​​
​​ ​vehicles​ ​​

218
00:06:10,987 --> 00:06:14,991
​​​ ​Heavy special​ ​​
​​ ​vehicles​ ​​

219
00:06:11,388 --> 00:06:14,991
​​​ ​There's like a special license you need​ ​​
​​ ​to drive some large vehicles.​ ​​

220
00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:16,526
​​​ ​Yeah, yeah!​ ​​

221
00:06:16,526 --> 00:06:17,394
​​​ ​Something like that?​ ​​

222
00:06:17,194 --> 00:06:19,062
​​​ ​Yeah.​ ​​

223
00:06:17,394 --> 00:06:19,563
​​​ ​So it's lumped into that class.​ ​​

224
00:06:19,062 --> 00:06:19,896
​​​ ​Like that.​ ​​

225
00:06:19,896 --> 00:06:22,299
​​​ ​How far from Earth are you right now?​ ​​

226
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:24,034
​​​ ​I can see the constellation Leo.​ ​​

227
00:06:24,034 --> 00:06:25,335
​​​ ​Really?​ ​​

228
00:06:24,034 --> 00:06:25,335
​​​ ​It's so pretty.​ ​​

229
00:06:25,335 --> 00:06:26,670
​​​ ​Woohoo!​ ​​

230
00:06:25,335 --> 00:06:26,670
​​​ ​Oh yeah!​ ​​

231
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:28,138
​​​ ​You wanna go there?​ ​​

232
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:31,475
​​​ ​So you're millions of light-years away right now.​ ​​

233
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:32,342
​​​ ​Leo​ ​​
​​ ​A constellation 80 light-years from Earth.​ ​​

234
00:06:30,374 --> 00:06:32,342
​​​ ​Right? Just how far away are you?​ ​​

235
00:06:32,342 --> 00:06:33,777
​​​ ​How many years should we wait for you?​ ​​

236
00:06:33,777 --> 00:06:35,112
​​​ ​How many years?​ ​​

237
00:06:36,446 --> 00:06:38,415
​​​ ​I'd say about twenty minu—​ ​​

238
00:06:38,415 --> 00:06:39,049
​​​ ​Nah,​ ​​

239
00:06:39,049 --> 00:06:40,417
​​​ ​I'll just head there immediately!​ ​​

240
00:06:40,417 --> 00:06:41,818
​​​ ​You can make it?​ ​​

241
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:42,853
​​​ ​Yeah, I can.​ ​​

242
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:43,754
​​​ ​You're coming back? You sure?​ ​​

243
00:06:43,754 --> 00:06:45,555
​​​ ​Should be right away!​ ​​

244
00:06:45,555 --> 00:06:47,157
​​​ ​Just wait for me!​ ​​

245
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,326
​​​ ​Now, this is a surprise call.​ ​​

246
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:50,727
​​​ ​Now arriving​ ​​

247
00:06:49,926 --> 00:06:50,727
​​​ ​Right?​ ​​

248
00:06:51,094 --> 00:06:52,095
​​​ ​Totally.​ ​​

249
00:06:52,095 --> 00:06:52,562
​​​ ​She's here!​ ​​

250
00:06:52,562 --> 00:06:53,630
​​​ ​See!​ ​​

251
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,364
​​​ ​She made it!​ ​​

252
00:06:53,964 --> 00:06:54,765
​​​ ​See!​ ​​

253
00:06:54,765 --> 00:06:56,233
​​​ ​Fast, ain't I?​ ​​

254
00:06:56,233 --> 00:06:58,335
​​​ ​And now Iofi-chan is here!​ ​​

255
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,070
​​​ ​Hey, there!​ ​​

256
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:03,707
​​​ ​Iofi-senpai, have you ever done​ ​​
​​ ​any surprise calls like this?​ ​​

257
00:07:03,707 --> 00:07:06,643
​​​ ​No, I don't think I've ever done any.​ ​​

258
00:07:06,643 --> 00:07:07,944
​​​ ​I see!​ ​​

259
00:07:07,944 --> 00:07:10,414
​​​ ​I asked some pretty crazy stuff.​ ​​

260
00:07:10,414 --> 00:07:12,015
​​​ ​Were you okay with that?​ ​​

261
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:14,084
​​​ ​Easy-peasy!​ ​​

262
00:07:14,084 --> 00:07:15,352
​​​ ​On the easy side, huh?​ ​​

263
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,354
​​​ ​I mean, for me, every day​ ​​

264
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:18,955
​​​ ​is nothing but chaos,​ ​​

265
00:07:18,955 --> 00:07:20,557
​​​ ​so this was no problem.​ ​​

266
00:07:20,557 --> 00:07:21,892
​​​ ​Every day is chaos!​ ​​

267
00:07:20,557 --> 00:07:22,726
​​​ ​Every day is chaos for you!​ ​​

268
00:07:22,726 --> 00:07:24,961
​​​ ​Yeah, every day is just chaos upon chaos.​ ​​

269
00:07:23,427 --> 00:07:25,429
​​​ ​Sounds rough!​ ​​

270
00:07:24,961 --> 00:07:26,229
​​​ ​So this was nothing!​ ​​

271
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:28,465
​​​ ​Bring it!​ ​​

272
00:07:30,167 --> 00:07:31,935
​​​ ​On to the next one!​ ​​

273
00:07:31,935 --> 00:07:34,704
​​​ ​This is the last surprise call.​ ​​

274
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,873
​​​ ​Last but not least is​ ​​

275
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:40,777
​​​ ​Takanashi Kiara from hololive EN!​ ​​

276
00:07:42,846 --> 00:07:43,847
​​​ ​Thoughts?​ ​​

277
00:07:43,847 --> 00:07:45,081
​​​ ​About Kiara?​ ​​

278
00:07:45,081 --> 00:07:47,751
​​​ ​Fried chicken!​ ​​

279
00:07:47,751 --> 00:07:50,387
​​​ ​You wanna eat Kiara?​ ​​

280
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:51,488
​​​ ​A fellow food friend?​ ​​

281
00:07:51,488 --> 00:07:53,690
​​​ ​Continuing our cooking (?) special,​ ​​

282
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,025
​​​ ​we'll see what Kiara's up to.​ ​​

283
00:07:55,025 --> 00:07:56,793
​​​ ​Let's find out.​ ​​

284
00:07:56,793 --> 00:07:59,463
​​​ ​Surprise call starts now!​ ​​

285
00:08:01,465 --> 00:08:02,933
​​​ ​Ring ring ring ring!​ ​​

286
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,267
​​​ ​I wonder.​ ​​

287
00:08:04,267 --> 00:08:05,335
​​​ ​Ring ring!​ ​​

288
00:08:05,802 --> 00:08:06,670
​​​ ​Ring ring!​ ​​

289
00:08:06,303 --> 00:08:07,771
​​​ ​Kikkeriki!​ ​​

290
00:08:07,771 --> 00:08:10,574
​​​ ​The president of KFP, though​ ​​
​​ ​they call me the manager,​ ​​

291
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:12,676
​​​ ​hololive EN's Takanashi Kiara here!​ ​​

292
00:08:12,676 --> 00:08:14,444
​​​ ​What can I do for you today?​ ​​

293
00:08:14,778 --> 00:08:17,013
​​​ ​Hello? It's Shishiro Botan.​ ​​

294
00:08:16,313 --> 00:08:17,013
​​​ ​Hi!​ ​​

295
00:08:17,013 --> 00:08:19,716
​​​ ​I'm here with Watame and Iofi.​ ​​

296
00:08:17,013 --> 00:08:18,114
​​​ ​'Sup!​ ​​

297
00:08:18,114 --> 00:08:19,716
​​​ ​Hello!​ ​​

298
00:08:19,716 --> 00:08:21,117
​​​ ​Ohh!​ ​​

299
00:08:21,117 --> 00:08:22,586
​​​ ​My senpais!​ ​​

300
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:24,488
​​​ ​My senpais, huh?​ ​​

301
00:08:23,687 --> 00:08:24,855
​​​ ​Yay!​ ​​

302
00:08:24,488 --> 00:08:26,156
​​​ ​I'm a little busy at the moment,​ ​​

303
00:08:26,156 --> 00:08:27,858
​​​ ​but if it's you guys,​ ​​

304
00:08:27,858 --> 00:08:30,494
​​​ ​I can make some time.​ ​​

305
00:08:30,494 --> 00:08:32,128
​​​ ​What were you doing?​ ​​

306
00:08:30,894 --> 00:08:32,128
​​​ ​Busy busy!​ ​​

307
00:08:32,128 --> 00:08:33,196
​​​ ​Right now,​ ​​

308
00:08:33,196 --> 00:08:38,869
​​​ ​I was just chewing out my KFP employees.​ ​​

309
00:08:34,197 --> 00:08:38,869
​​​ ​KFP: The fast-food chain that Kiara runs.​ ​​

310
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:39,503
​​​ ​Oh? What happened?​ ​​

311
00:08:39,503 --> 00:08:43,607
​​​ ​They're having a little meltdown​ ​​
​​ ​over their salary.​ ​​

312
00:08:45,542 --> 00:08:47,143
​​​ ​Should you be telling us this?​ ​​

313
00:08:47,143 --> 00:08:49,446
​​​ ​How much do you pay them?​ ​​

314
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,181
​​​ ​Uh... well...​ ​​

315
00:08:51,181 --> 00:08:54,084
​​​ ​It's a... at-will.​ ​​

316
00:08:54,084 --> 00:08:56,286
​​​ ​The paycheck is...​ ​​

317
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,654
​​​ ​also at-will (free).​ ​​

318
00:08:57,654 --> 00:09:01,024
​​​ ​The paycheck is also at-will (free).​ ​​

319
00:09:01,024 --> 00:09:04,628
​​​ ​So the people who show up​ ​​
​​ ​just really wanna work for you?​ ​​

320
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:05,629
​​​ ​That's right!​ ​​

321
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:06,730
​​​ ​But after that,​ ​​

322
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:07,631
​​​ ​the chickens—​ ​​

323
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:10,033
​​​ ​all my employees are chickens,​ ​​
​​ ​by the way.​ ​​

324
00:09:10,033 --> 00:09:14,905
​​​ ​But chickens have a birdbrain memory.​ ​​

325
00:09:14,905 --> 00:09:18,174
​​​ ​They keep complaining to me about it!​ ​​

326
00:09:15,238 --> 00:09:16,406
​​​ ​Right.​ ​​

327
00:09:18,675 --> 00:09:21,011
​​​ ​So they forget.​ ​​

328
00:09:20,377 --> 00:09:21,011
​​​ ​Really!​ ​​

329
00:09:21,011 --> 00:09:24,281
​​​ ​What? What? Don't bother me!​ ​​

330
00:09:22,612 --> 00:09:23,547
​​​ ​Pay us​ ​​

331
00:09:24,281 --> 00:09:27,183
​​​ ​I'm on the phone right now!​ ​​
​​ ​Don't bug me.​ ​​

332
00:09:27,183 --> 00:09:29,185
​​​ ​I'm talking to my senpais right now!​ ​​

333
00:09:29,185 --> 00:09:29,819
​​​ ​Don't touch me!​ ​​

334
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:30,887
​​​ ​N-No touchy!​ ​​

335
00:09:30,887 --> 00:09:31,421
​​​ ​Hey!​ ​​

336
00:09:31,421 --> 00:09:32,923
​​​ ​Pay us​ ​​

337
00:09:31,421 --> 00:09:32,222
​​​ ​Hey! Hey!​ ​​
