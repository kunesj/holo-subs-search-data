can be covered up by the kitchen I guess

3700
01:47:44,870 --> 01:47:44,880
can be covered up by the kitchen I guess
 

3701
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:48,229
can be covered up by the kitchen I guess
probably that's what uh wasn't done so

3702
01:47:48,229 --> 01:47:48,239
probably that's what uh wasn't done so
 

3703
01:47:48,239 --> 01:47:51,070
probably that's what uh wasn't done so
properly in the end I don't really know

3704
01:47:51,070 --> 01:47:51,080
properly in the end I don't really know
 

3705
01:47:51,080 --> 01:47:55,350
properly in the end I don't really know
but um this really made me feel insecure

3706
01:47:55,350 --> 01:47:55,360
but um this really made me feel insecure
 

3707
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:57,149
but um this really made me feel insecure
because I was like okay what do I do

3708
01:47:57,149 --> 01:47:57,159
because I was like okay what do I do
 

3709

3711
01:47:59,480 --> 01:48:03,870

information so they were done eventually

3712
01:48:03,870 --> 01:48:03,880

01:48:35,669 --> 01:48:35,679
still was also like not sure because I
 

3737
01:48:35,679 --> 01:48:37,149
still was also like not sure because I
wouldn't even know what to say because

3738
01:48:37,149 --> 01:48:37,159
wouldn't even know what to say because
 

3739
01:48:37,159 --> 01:48:40,270
wouldn't even know what to say because
the Dude the way he phrased everything

3740

the Dude the way he phrased everything
 

3741
01:48:40,280 --> 01:48:43,189

just confused me a lot I would I didn't

3742
01:48:43,189 --> 01:48:43,199
just confused me a lot I would I didn't
 

3743
01:48:43,199 --> 01:48:45,310
just confused me a lot I would I didn't
even know like what exactly was wrong

3744
01:48:45,310 --> 01:48:45,320
even know like what exactly was wrong
 

3745
01:48:45,320 --> 01:48:46,910
even know like what exactly was wrong
with it so I couldn't even complain

3746
01:48:46,910 --> 01:48:46,920
with it so I couldn't even complain
 

3747
01:48:46,920 --> 01:48:49,629
with it so I couldn't even complain
about it at the spot you know what I

3748
01:48:49,629 --> 01:48:49,639
about it at the spot you know what I
 

3749
01:48:49,639 --> 01:48:52,350
about it at the spot you know what I
mean so I wanted to maybe ask around a

3750
01:48:52,350 --> 01:48:52,360
mean so I wanted to maybe ask around a
 

3751
01:48:52,360 --> 01:48:55,870
mean so I wanted to maybe ask around a
little bit it before I would complain to

3752
01:48:55,870 --> 01:48:55,880
little bit it before I would complain to
 

3753
01:48:55,880 --> 01:48:58,390
little bit it before I would complain to
them if there was anything to complain

3754
01:48:58,390 --> 01:48:58,400
them if there was anything to complain
 

3755
01:48:58,400 --> 01:49:01,310
them if there was anything to complain
but if if the dude himself tells me that

3756
01:49:01,310 --> 01:49:01,320
but if if the dude himself tells me that
 

3757
01:49:01,320 --> 01:49:05,550
but if if the dude himself tells me that
this is not so properly done then it

3758
01:49:05,550 --> 01:49:05,560
this is not so properly done then it
 

3759
01:49:05,560 --> 01:49:07,790
this is not so properly done then it
gives me the feeling that I should

3760
01:49:07,790 --> 01:49:07,800
gives me the feeling that I should
 

3761
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:11,390
gives me the feeling that I should
probably complain about it if even he is

3762
01:49:11,390 --> 01:49:11,400
probably complain about it if even he is
 

3763
01:49:11,400 --> 01:49:14,270
probably complain about it if even he is
saying

3764
01:49:14,270 --> 01:49:14,280

 

3765
01:49:14,280 --> 01:49:17,510

so yeah but like if I were to I have I

3766
01:49:17,510 --> 01:49:17,520
so yeah but like if I were to I have I
 

3767
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:19,030
so yeah but like if I were to I have I
it was like this kind of atmosphere that

3768
01:49:19,030 --> 01:49:19,040
it was like this kind of atmosphere that
 

3769
01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:20,709
it was like this kind of atmosphere that
like if I were to question it right

3770
01:49:20,709 --> 01:49:20,719
like if I were to question it right
 

3771
01:49:20,719 --> 01:49:22,870
like if I were to question it right
there and then then it would would have

01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:24,669
there and then then it would would have
been pretty obvious that the colleague

know maybe this should be lowered

3842
01:51:05,350 --> 01:51:05,360
know maybe this should be lowered
 

3843
01:51:05,360 --> 01:51:08,149
know maybe this should be lowered
because uh I've been getting some input

3844
01:51:08,149 --> 01:51:08,159
because uh I've been getting some input
 

3845
01:51:08,159 --> 01:51:10,750
because uh I've been getting some input
from others and I could not say that one

3846
01:51:10,750 --> 01:51:10,760
from others and I could not say that one
 

3847
01:51:10,760 --> 01:51:14,030
from others and I could not say that one
of this input was from one of their own

3848
01:51:14,030 --> 01:51:14,040
of this input was from one of their own
 

3849
01:51:14,040 --> 01:51:16,149
of this input was from one of their own
workers but I feel like that would have

3850
01:51:16,149 --> 01:51:16,159
workers but I feel like that would have
 

3851
01:51:16,159 --> 01:51:19,430
workers but I feel like that would have
been very important information to say

3852
01:51:19,430 --> 01:51:19,440
been very important information to say
 

3853
01:51:19,440 --> 01:51:21,790
been very important information to say
that even you know getting an opinion

3854
01:51:21,790 --> 01:51:21,800
that even you know getting an opinion
 

3855
01:51:21,800 --> 01:51:23,470
that even you know getting an opinion
from others might always be kind of

3856
01:51:23,470 --> 01:51:23,480

moment that the only reason I brought
all of this up was because one of your

01:53:57,310 --> 01:53:57,320
all of this up was because one of your
 

3969
01:53:57,320 --> 01:54:00,109
all of this up was because one of your
workers told me it's not good

3970

workers told me it's not good
 

3971

work then that would have helped my
 

3973
01:54:03,199 --> 01:54:04,709
work then that would have helped my
case

3974
01:54:04,709 --> 01:54:04,719

3977
01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:13,030
yeah so yeah I I I was destroyed and
then I just paid the normal price

3978
01:54:13,030 --> 01:54:13,040
then I just paid the normal price
 

3979
01:54:13,040 --> 01:54:16,950
then I just paid the normal price
and it it it was uh done and the kitchen

3980
01:54:16,950 --> 01:54:16,960
and it it it was uh done and the kitchen
 

3981
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:18,910
and it it it was uh done and the kitchen
was put in and everything and it all

3982
01:54:18,910 --> 01:54:18,920
was put in and everything and it all
 

3983
01:54:18,920 --> 01:54:23,149
was put in and everything and it all
works and so on but it's like apparently

3984
01:54:23,149 --> 01:54:23,159
works and so on but it's like apparently
 

3985
01:54:23,159 --> 01:54:24,510
works and so on but it's like apparently
it could have been nicer but it's not

3986
01:54:24,510 --> 01:54:24,520
it could have been nicer but it's not
 

3987
01:54:24,520 --> 01:54:26,790
it could have been nicer but it's not
like it was ever not functional but I

3988
01:54:26,790 --> 01:54:26,800
like it was ever not functional but I
 

3989
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:29,709
like it was ever not functional but I
think the concern was like the

3990
01:54:29,709 --> 01:54:29,719
think the concern was like the
 

3991
01:54:29,719 --> 01:54:33,189
think the concern was like the
friend uh of the friend brought up the

friend uh of the friend brought up the
concern that possibly if I ever have

concern that possibly if I ever have
 

3995
01:54:36,360 --> 01:54:41,109
concern that possibly if I ever have
like water damage then maybe that could

3996
01:54:41,109 --> 01:54:41,119

5601
02:39:34,040 --> 02:39:35,830
wasn't YouTube culture overall but then
we got it and a lot of people know it

5602
02:39:35,830 --> 02:39:35,840
we got it and a lot of people know it
 

5603
02:39:35,840 --> 02:39:38,710
we got it and a lot of people know it
from twitch and so on so we just kind of

5604
02:39:38,710 --> 02:39:38,720
from twitch and so on so we just kind of
 

5605
02:39:38,720 --> 02:39:43,349
from twitch and so on so we just kind of
went with it and yeah although they

5606
02:39:43,349 --> 02:39:43,359
went with it and yeah although they
 

5607
02:39:43,359 --> 02:39:47,150
went with it and yeah although they
turned it on for that like Koka relay uh

5608
02:39:47,150 --> 02:39:47,160
turned it on for that like Koka relay uh
 

5609
02:39:47,160 --> 02:39:48,870
turned it on for that like Koka relay uh
that was like New Year's or Christmas or

5610
02:39:48,870 --> 02:39:48,880
that was like New Year's or Christmas or
 

5611
02:39:48,880 --> 02:39:50,309
that was like New Year's or Christmas or
something

5612
02:39:50,309 --> 02:39:50,319
something
 

5613
02:39:50,319 --> 02:39:52,070
something
they turned it on even the Japanese

5614
02:39:52,070 --> 02:39:52,080
they turned it on even the Japanese
 

5615
02:39:52,080 --> 02:39:54,670
they turned it on even the Japanese
members and we like raided each other

5616
02:39:54,670 --> 02:39:54,680
members and we like raided each other
 

5617
02:39:54,680 --> 02:39:56,870
members and we like raided each other
but then only the ones who participated

5618
02:39:56,870 --> 02:39:56,880
but then only the ones who participated
 

5619
02:39:56,880 --> 02:39:58,510
but then only the ones who participated
did that and I guess maybe they turned

5620
02:39:58,510 --> 02:39:58,520
did that and I guess maybe they turned
 

5621
02:39:58,520 --> 02:40:00,389
did that and I guess maybe they turned
it off again as

5622
02:40:00,389 --> 02:40:00,399
it off again as
 

5623
02:40:00,399 --> 02:40:02,950
it off again as
well but that's like the first time some

5624
02:40:02,950 --> 02:40:02,960
well but that's like the first time some
 

5625
02:40:02,960 --> 02:40:05,670

of these members found out about the F

5626
02:40:05,670 --> 02:40:05,680
of these members found out about the F
 

5627
02:40:05,680 --> 02:40:07,910
of these members found out about the F
feature in the first

5628
02:40:07,910 --> 02:40:07,920

10763
05:10:51,840 --> 05:10:53,390
the the stupid thing is I can only see
the status of the batteries of

everything when I have everything on and
 

10767
05:10:57,040 --> 05:11:00,390

has to be turned
 

10771
05:11:01,798 --> 05:11:05,110

explain what it
 

10855
05:12:53,878 --> 05:12:56,350
