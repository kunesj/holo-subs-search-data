difficult because like

2431
01:26:42,169 --> 01:26:42,179
difficult because like
 

2432
01:26:42,179 --> 01:26:44,510
difficult because like
you can't really take the time to turn

2433
01:26:44,510 --> 01:26:44,520
you can't really take the time to turn
 

2434
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:47,930
you can't really take the time to turn
around and run back to the back of the

2435
01:26:47,930 --> 01:26:47,940
around and run back to the back of the
 

2436
01:26:47,940 --> 01:26:52,370
around and run back to the back of the
field walking backwards is too slow so

2437
01:26:52,370 --> 01:26:52,380
field walking backwards is too slow so
 

2438
01:26:52,380 --> 01:26:55,970
field walking backwards is too slow so
you have to rely on your teammate

2439
01:26:55,970 --> 01:26:55,980
you have to rely on your teammate
 

2440
01:26:55,980 --> 01:26:59,950
you have to rely on your teammate
who's behind you if you're in the front

2441
01:26:59,950 --> 01:26:59,960
who's behind you if you're in the front
 

2442
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:02,870
who's behind you if you're in the front
and the same with soccer it was so

2443
01:27:02,870 --> 01:27:02,880
and the same with soccer it was so
 

2444
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:05,390
and the same with soccer it was so
difficult because you know I felt like

2445
01:27:05,390 --> 01:27:05,400
difficult because you know I felt like
 

2446
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:08,149
difficult because you know I felt like
80 percent of the time

2447
01:27:08,149 --> 01:27:08,159
80 percent of the time
 

2448
01:27:08,159 --> 01:27:09,229
80 percent of the time
um

2449
01:27:09,229 --> 01:27:09,239
um
 

2450
01:27:09,239 --> 01:27:11,149
um
they were like repeating the same

2451
01:27:11,149 --> 01:27:11,159
they were like repeating the same
 

2452
01:27:11,159 --> 01:27:12,649
they were like repeating the same
pattern

2453
01:27:12,649 --> 01:27:12,659
pattern
 

2454
01:27:12,659 --> 01:27:15,530
pattern
the same back and forth and

2455
01:27:15,530 --> 01:27:15,540
the same back and forth and
 

2456
01:27:15,540 --> 01:27:18,530
the same back and forth and
you know when eofi would shoot the ball

2457
01:27:18,530 --> 01:27:18,540
you know when eofi would shoot the ball
 

2458
01:27:18,540 --> 01:27:20,510
you know when eofi would shoot the ball
to us

2459
01:27:20,510 --> 01:27:20,520
to us
 

2460
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:23,149
to us
the problem is we have to like

2461
01:27:23,149 --> 01:27:23,159
the problem is we have to like
 

2462
01:27:23,159 --> 01:27:25,729
the problem is we have to like
see where it's going to

2463
01:27:25,729 --> 01:27:25,739
see where it's going to
 

2464
01:27:25,739 --> 01:27:27,490
see where it's going to
but then

2465
01:27:27,490 --> 01:27:27,500
but then
 

2466
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:30,410
but then
even if we're lucky and the ball lands

2467
01:27:30,410 --> 01:27:30,420
even if we're lucky and the ball lands
 

2468
01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:31,850
even if we're lucky and the ball lands
where we are we then have to like turn

2469
01:27:31,850 --> 01:27:31,860
where we are we then have to like turn
 

2470
01:27:31,860 --> 01:27:35,209
where we are we then have to like turn
around and Pew shoot it

2471
01:27:35,209 --> 01:27:35,219
around and Pew shoot it
 

2472
01:27:35,219 --> 01:27:38,090
around and Pew shoot it
in the other direction that's so

2473
01:27:38,090 --> 01:27:38,100
in the other direction that's so
 

2474
01:27:38,100 --> 01:27:39,890
in the other direction that's so
difficult like because the turning

2475
01:27:39,890 --> 01:27:39,900
difficult like because the turning
 

2476
01:27:39,900 --> 01:27:42,709
difficult like because the turning
around takes so much time

2477
01:27:42,709 --> 01:27:42,719
around takes so much time
 

2478
01:27:42,719 --> 01:27:45,530
around takes so much time

and then suddenly came back and I think
they switched the order suddenly because

3633
01:55:35,090 --> 01:55:35,100
they switched the order suddenly because
 

3634
01:55:35,100 --> 01:55:37,550
they switched the order suddenly because
they had to discuss more I guess and

3635
01:55:37,550 --> 01:55:37,560
they had to discuss more I guess and
 

3636
01:55:37,560 --> 01:55:38,810
they had to discuss more I guess and
