05:36:59,150 --> 05:36:59,160
yeah
 

13864
05:36:59,160 --> 05:37:02,948
yeah
but depending on how well the Alice

13865
05:37:02,948 --> 05:37:02,958
but depending on how well the Alice
 

13866
05:37:02,958 --> 05:37:05,448

uh stream does maybe I will continue

13867
05:37:05,448 --> 05:37:05,458
uh stream does maybe I will continue
 

13868
05:37:05,458 --> 05:37:06,650
uh stream does maybe I will continue
that one as well because we're

13869
05:37:06,650 --> 05:37:06,660
that one as well because we're
 

13870
05:37:06,660 --> 05:37:07,970
that one as well because we're
definitely not going to finish it in one

13871
05:37:07,970 --> 05:37:07,980
definitely not going to finish it in one
 

13872
05:37:07,980 --> 05:37:10,250
definitely not going to finish it in one
stream I suppose

13873
05:37:10,250 --> 05:37:10,260
stream I suppose
 

13874
05:37:10,260 --> 05:37:11,930
stream I suppose
um and for little nightmares we're gonna

13875
05:37:11,930 --> 05:37:11,940
um and for little nightmares we're gonna
 

13876
05:37:11,940 --> 05:37:13,788
um and for little nightmares we're gonna
play one I suppose and I heard there's

13877
05:37:13,788 --> 05:37:13,798
play one I suppose and I heard there's
 

13878
05:37:13,798 --> 05:37:15,590
play one I suppose and I heard there's
the second part right little nightmares

13879
05:37:15,590 --> 05:37:15,600
the second part right little nightmares
 

13880
05:37:15,600 --> 05:37:16,868
the second part right little nightmares
one two

13881
05:37:16,868 --> 05:37:16,878
one two
 

13882
05:37:16,878 --> 05:37:20,150
one two
so we might continue little nightmares

13883
05:37:20,150 --> 05:37:20,160
so we might continue little nightmares
 

13884
05:37:20,160 --> 05:37:21,890
so we might continue little nightmares
as well

13885
05:37:21,890 --> 05:37:21,900
as well
 

13886
05:37:21,900 --> 05:37:24,110
as well
that might be turned into a series as

13887
05:37:24,110 --> 05:37:24,120
that might be turned into a series as
 

13888
05:37:24,120 --> 05:37:26,868
that might be turned into a series as
well I think maybe I don't know how long

13889
05:37:26,868 --> 05:37:26,878
well I think maybe I don't know how long
 

13890
05:37:26,878 --> 05:37:29,170
well I think maybe I don't know how long
it is

13891
05:37:29,170 --> 05:37:29,180
it is
 

13892
05:37:29,180 --> 05:37:32,208
it is
but that also depends on I guess the the

13893
05:37:32,208 --> 05:37:32,218
but that also depends on I guess the the
 

13894
05:37:32,218 --> 05:37:34,310
but that also depends on I guess the the
feedback from you guys if you like it

13895
05:37:34,310 --> 05:37:34,320
feedback from you guys if you like it
 

13896
05:37:34,320 --> 05:37:38,030
feedback from you guys if you like it
who is even scarier is it that scary

13897
05:37:38,030 --> 05:37:38,040
who is even scarier is it that scary
 

13898
05:37:38,040 --> 05:37:40,970
who is even scarier is it that scary
it's really short okay

13899
05:37:40,970 --> 05:37:40,980
it's really short okay
 

13900
05:37:40,980 --> 05:37:46,190
it's really short okay
then we might squeeze that in as well

13901
05:37:46,190 --> 05:37:46,200

 

13902
05:37:46,200 --> 05:37:48,890

so instead of immediately jumping into

13903
05:37:48,890 --> 05:37:48,900
so instead of immediately jumping into
 

13904
05:37:48,900 --> 05:37:50,830
so instead of immediately jumping into
another super long

13905
05:37:50,830 --> 05:37:50,840

um
not burnt out on it but I do see

13911
05:37:58,628 --> 05:37:58,638
not burnt out on it but I do see
 

13912
05:37:58,638 --> 05:38:01,910
not burnt out on it but I do see
currently I see more charm in

13913
05:38:01,910 --> 05:38:01,920
currently I see more charm in
 

13914
05:38:01,920 --> 05:38:04,548
currently I see more charm in
in a charmand and

13915
05:38:04,548 --> 05:38:04,558
in a charmand and
 

13916
05:38:04,558 --> 05:38:06,430
in a charmand and
um

13917
05:38:06,430 --> 05:38:06,440
um
 

13918
05:38:06,440 --> 05:38:10,670
um
merits in playing shorter stealth yeah

13919
05:38:10,670 --> 05:38:10,680
merits in playing shorter stealth yeah
 

13920
05:38:10,680 --> 05:38:14,208
merits in playing shorter stealth yeah
and trying out a lot of new things

13921
05:38:14,208 --> 05:38:14,218
and trying out a lot of new things
 

13922
05:38:14,218 --> 05:38:16,730
and trying out a lot of new things
because because I I really like those

13923

because because I I really like those
 

13924
05:38:16,740 --> 05:38:18,410
because because I I really like those
games those long games but right now

13925
05:38:18,410 --> 05:38:18,420
games those long games but right now
 

13926
05:38:18,420 --> 05:38:20,330
games those long games but right now
there's nothing that I'm like all I want

13927
05:38:20,330 --> 05:38:20,340
there's nothing that I'm like all I want
 

13928
05:38:20,340 --> 05:38:23,690
there's nothing that I'm like all I want
to play this right away anyway and

13929
05:38:23,690 --> 05:38:23,700
to play this right away anyway and
 

13930
05:38:23,700 --> 05:38:26,288
to play this right away anyway and
um I know that a lot of people

13931
05:38:26,288 --> 05:38:26,298
um I know that a lot of people
 

13932
05:38:26,298 --> 05:38:29,448
um I know that a lot of people
don't like those long series because

13933
05:38:29,448 --> 05:38:29,458
don't like those long series because
 

13934
05:38:29,458 --> 05:38:31,190
don't like those long series because
it's hard to get into and if you miss

13935
05:38:31,190 --> 05:38:31,200
it's hard to get into and if you miss
 

13936
05:38:31,200 --> 05:38:34,070
it's hard to get into and if you miss
something then blah or if you want to

13937
05:38:34,070 --> 05:38:34,080
something then blah or if you want to
 

13938
05:38:34,080 --> 05:38:35,330
something then blah or if you want to
play the game but you haven't yet then

13939
05:38:35,330 --> 05:38:35,340
play the game but you haven't yet then
 

13940
05:38:35,340 --> 05:38:38,150
play the game but you haven't yet then
you don't want to get spoiled or if you

13941
05:38:38,150 --> 05:38:38,160
you don't want to get spoiled or if you
 

13942
05:38:38,160 --> 05:38:40,490
you don't want to get spoiled or if you
have already played it then it's boring

13943
05:38:40,490 --> 05:38:40,500
have already played it then it's boring
 

13944
05:38:40,500 --> 05:38:42,350
have already played it then it's boring
to you because you already know it and

13945
05:38:42,350 --> 05:38:42,360
to you because you already know it and
 

13946
05:38:42,360 --> 05:38:45,048
to you because you already know it and
if you decide if you decide to never

13947
05:38:45,048 --> 05:38:45,058
if you decide if you decide to never
 

13948
05:38:45,058 --> 05:38:46,010
if you decide if you decide to never
play it because you're just not

13949
05:38:46,010 --> 05:38:46,020
play it because you're just not
 

13950
05:38:46,020 --> 05:38:47,150
play it because you're just not
interested in a game that you're

13951
05:38:47,150 --> 05:38:47,160
interested in a game that you're
 

13952
05:38:47,160 --> 05:38:48,230
interested in a game that you're
probably not going to watch your stream

13953
05:38:48,230 --> 05:38:48,240
probably not going to watch your stream
 

13954
05:38:48,240 --> 05:38:49,548
probably not going to watch your stream
either

13955
05:38:49,548 --> 05:38:49,558
either
 

13956
05:38:49,558 --> 05:38:53,570
either
so it really filters out a lot of people

13957
05:38:53,570 --> 05:38:53,580
so it really filters out a lot of people
 

13958
05:38:53,580 --> 05:38:56,208
so it really filters out a lot of people
um which is very unfortunate so I'm

13959
05:38:56,208 --> 05:38:56,218
um which is very unfortunate so I'm
 

13960
05:38:56,218 --> 05:38:58,128
um which is very unfortunate so I'm
gonna try for a little while not forever

13961
05:38:58,128 --> 05:38:58,138
gonna try for a little while not forever
 

13962
05:38:58,138 --> 05:38:59,690
gonna try for a little while not forever
but for a little while I'm gonna try to

13963
05:38:59,690 --> 05:38:59,700
but for a little while I'm gonna try to
 

13964
05:38:59,700 --> 05:39:01,628
but for a little while I'm gonna try to
do some shorter games

13965
05:39:01,628 --> 05:39:01,638
do some shorter games
 

13966
05:39:01,638 --> 05:39:05,750
do some shorter games
and try out some some new things

13967
05:39:05,750 --> 05:39:05,760
and try out some some new things
 

13968
05:39:05,760 --> 05:39:07,788
and try out some some new things
I will still definitely go back to

13969
05:39:07,788 --> 05:39:07,798
I will still definitely go back to
 

13970
05:39:07,798 --> 05:39:09,948
I will still definitely go back to
playing on jrpg once I see something

13971
05:39:09,948 --> 05:39:09,958
playing on jrpg once I see something
 

13972
05:39:09,958 --> 05:39:12,230
playing on jrpg once I see something
that I want to play now

13973
05:39:12,230 --> 05:39:12,240
that I want to play now
 

13974
05:39:12,240 --> 05:39:13,730
that I want to play now
um

13975
05:39:13,730 --> 05:39:13,740
um
 

13976
05:39:13,740 --> 05:39:17,090
um
yeah

13977
05:39:17,090 --> 05:39:17,100

 

13978
05:39:17,100 --> 05:39:19,850

hope you guys are okay with it

13979
05:39:19,850 --> 05:39:19,860
hope you guys are okay with it
 

13980
05:39:19,860 --> 05:39:22,010
hope you guys are okay with it
but judging from the comments I got

13981
05:39:22,010 --> 05:39:22,020
but judging from the comments I got
 

13982
05:39:22,020 --> 05:39:24,948
but judging from the comments I got
yesterday on that poll you guys seem
