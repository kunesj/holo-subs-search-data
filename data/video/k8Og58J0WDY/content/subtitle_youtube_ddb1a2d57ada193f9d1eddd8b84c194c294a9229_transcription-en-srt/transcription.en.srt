going on like I thought I'm doing this
really wrong and we're gonna fail for

2244
01:03:57,349 --> 01:03:57,359
really wrong and we're gonna fail for
 

2245
01:03:57,359 --> 01:03:59,750
really wrong and we're gonna fail for
like like a split second I thought this

2246
01:03:59,750 --> 01:03:59,760
like like a split second I thought this
 

2247
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,490
like like a split second I thought this
this is I'm doing it wrong we're gonna

2248
01:04:01,490 --> 01:04:01,500
this is I'm doing it wrong we're gonna
 

2249
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:03,410
this is I'm doing it wrong we're gonna
crash or something

2250
01:04:03,410 --> 01:04:03,420
crash or something
 

2251
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:05,750

happens so fast so uh yeah it's not
 

2255
01:04:09,059 --> 01:04:11,930
happens so fast so uh yeah it's not
really a big deal I think I could do it

2256
01:04:11,930 --> 01:04:11,940
really a big deal I think I could do it
 

2257
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:12,789
really a big deal I think I could do it
again

2258
01:04:12,789 --> 01:04:12,799
