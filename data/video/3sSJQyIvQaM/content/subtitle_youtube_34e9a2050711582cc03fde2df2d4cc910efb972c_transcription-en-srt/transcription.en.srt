ones

156
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:04,080

uh and people who pretty much like the
healers are balanced so that if you do

722
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:52,640
healers are balanced so that if you do
 

723
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,070
healers are balanced so that if you do
more damage you're gonna do less healing

724
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:54,080
more damage you're gonna do less healing
 

725
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,430

727
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,870
for your team
but you can still be like a support

728
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:56,880
but you can still be like a support
 

729
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,789
but you can still be like a support
character you do some amount of healing

730
00:18:58,789 --> 00:18:58,799
character you do some amount of healing
 

731
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,950
character you do some amount of healing
and you also provide shields uh i think

732
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:00,960
and you also provide shields uh i think
 

733
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,190
and you also provide shields uh i think
myself okay

734
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:03,200
myself okay
 

735
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,310
myself okay
uh

736
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:06,320

 

737
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,190

it's

738
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:07,200
it's
 

739
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,789
it's
i guess you know a healer is kind of

740
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:08,799
i guess you know a healer is kind of
 

741

i guess you know a healer is kind of
hard to test out one versus one but

00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:11,919
hard to test out one versus one but
 

743
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,070
hard to test out one versus one but
uh so

744
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:14,080

shift forward you have three shifts and
 

925
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,789
shift forward you have three shifts and
they reload after a certain amount of

926
00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:40,799
they reload after a certain amount of
 

927
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:41,590
they reload after a certain amount of
time

928
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:41,600
time
 

929
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:48,390
time
i actually did that in the tutorial

930

01:35:26,639 --> 01:35:29,669
but is it the same kind of um
like we have to protect a base again or

4090
01:35:29,669 --> 01:35:29,679
like we have to protect a base again or
 

4091

do we push something
 

4093
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:32,950
do we push something
so now we're doing payload we start off

4094
01:35:32,950 --> 01:35:32,960
so now we're doing payload we start off
 

4095
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:35,430
so now we're doing payload we start off
with payload

4096
01:35:35,430 --> 01:35:35,440
with payload
 

4097
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:37,510
with payload
so with payload you you get it to each

4098
01:35:37,510 --> 01:35:37,520
so with payload you you get it to each
 

4099
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:39,189
so with payload you you get it to each
uh point in the map and usually there's

4100
01:35:39,189 --> 01:35:39,199
uh point in the map and usually there's
 

4101
01:35:39,199 --> 01:35:40,629
uh point in the map and usually there's
like three or four and you just have to

4102
01:35:40,629 --> 01:35:40,639
like three or four and you just have to
 

4103
01:35:40,639 --> 01:35:41,910
like three or four and you just have to
push it all the way to the end and then

4104
01:35:41,910 --> 01:35:41,920
push it all the way to the end and then
 

4105
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:42,709
push it all the way to the end and then
you win

4106
01:35:42,709 --> 01:35:42,719
you win
 

4107
01:35:42,719 --> 01:35:43,750
you win
okay

4108
01:35:43,750 --> 01:35:43,760
okay
 

4109
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:44,950
okay
push

4110
01:35:44,950 --> 01:35:44,960
push
 

4111
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:46,390
push
push

4112
01:35:46,390 --> 01:35:46,400
push
 

4113
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:49,189
push
now that i finally know to push e

4114
01:35:49,189 --> 01:35:49,199
now that i finally know to push e
 

4115
01:35:49,199 --> 01:35:51,510
now that i finally know to push e
i will push it more often and i will

4116
01:35:51,510 --> 01:35:51,520
i will push it more often and i will
 

4117
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:53,990
i will push it more often and i will
just use it on the the fin characters

4118
01:35:53,990 --> 01:35:54,000
just use it on the the fin characters
 

4119
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,430
just use it on the the fin characters
because the fin characters are usually

4120
01:35:55,430 --> 01:35:55,440
because the fin characters are usually
 

4121
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:57,189
because the fin characters are usually
