1890
01:03:03,430 --> 01:03:03,440
others so with some trial and error but
 

1891
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:05,430
others so with some trial and error but
then i was like

1892
01:03:05,430 --> 01:03:05,440
then i was like
 

1893
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:07,910

you know it still bothers me to have the

1894
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:07,920
you know it still bothers me to have the
 

1895
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,829

it just
 

1899
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:14,630
it just
it just doesn't work with the concept so

1900
01:03:14,630 --> 01:03:14,640
it just doesn't work with the concept so
 

1901
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,950
it just doesn't work with the concept so
i asked can we go a step further and

1902
01:03:16,950 --> 01:03:16,960
i asked can we go a step further and
 

1903
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:19,430
i asked can we go a step further and
remove the belt is that possible and

1911
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:29,510
so we basically just drew
on top of everything and then there is

1912
01:03:29,510 --> 01:03:29,520

like

2162
01:07:57,270 --> 01:07:57,280
like
 

2163
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:59,109
like
we've made like like two different

2164
01:07:59,109 --> 01:07:59,119
we've made like like two different
 

2165
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:00,870
we've made like like two different
choreographies

2166
01:08:00,870 --> 01:08:00,880

01:08:07,109 --> 01:08:07,119
um capture it twice two different parts
 

2173
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:08,390
um capture it twice two different parts
and then put it together in the music

2174
01:08:08,390 --> 01:08:08,400
and then put it together in the music
 

2175
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:09,510

for like general use when i'm dancing
alone

2190
01:08:24,550 --> 01:08:24,560
alone
 

2191
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,870
alone
uh i don't know overall it then felt

2192
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:26,880
uh i don't know overall it then felt
 

2193
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:30,309
uh i don't know overall it then felt
like too much of a complicated thought

2194
01:08:30,309 --> 01:08:30,319
like too much of a complicated thought
 

2195
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:32,149
like too much of a complicated thought
i was like discussing

2196
01:08:32,149 --> 01:08:32,159
i was like discussing
 

2197
01:08:32,159 --> 01:08:33,749
i was like discussing
how we would put that into the music

2198
01:08:33,749 --> 01:08:33,759
how we would put that into the music
 

2199
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:35,030
how we would put that into the music
video but i thought it would fit well

2200
01:08:35,030 --> 01:08:35,040
video but i thought it would fit well
 

2201
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:36,070
video but i thought it would fit well
because we have a black and a white

2202
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:36,080
because we have a black and a white
 

2203
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:37,590
because we have a black and a white
kiwawa and what if they dance with each

2204
01:08:37,590 --> 01:08:37,600
kiwawa and what if they dance with each
 

2205
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:38,550
kiwawa and what if they dance with each
other but have like different

2206
01:08:38,550 --> 01:08:38,560
other but have like different
 

2207
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:40,149
other but have like different
choreographies you know but that they

2208
01:08:40,149 --> 01:08:40,159
choreographies you know but that they
 

2209
01:08:40,159 --> 01:08:42,229
choreographies you know but that they
come together well but you know i had

2210
01:08:42,229 --> 01:08:42,239
come together well but you know i had
 

2211
01:08:42,239 --> 01:08:46,789
come together well but you know i had
this idea but then i thought

2212
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:46,799

 

2213
01:08:46,799 --> 01:08:47,910

maybe

2214
01:08:47,910 --> 01:08:47,920
maybe
 

2215
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:50,630
maybe
maybe too complicated

2216
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:50,640
maybe too complicated
 

2217
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:51,669
maybe too complicated
uh

2218
01:08:51,669 --> 01:08:51,679
uh
 

2219
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:55,269
uh
yeah so kind of ditched that idea

2220
01:08:55,269 --> 01:08:55,279
yeah so kind of ditched that idea
 

2221
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:56,789
yeah so kind of ditched that idea
it was very ambitious it's not

2222
01:08:56,789 --> 01:08:56,799
it was very ambitious it's not
 

2223
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:58,309
it was very ambitious it's not
impossible and maybe in the future i

2224
01:08:58,309 --> 01:08:58,319
impossible and maybe in the future i
 

2225
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:02,950
impossible and maybe in the future i
will i will do something like that maybe

2226
01:09:02,950 --> 01:09:02,960

 

2227
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:05,510

yeah i just i just kind of you know i

2228
01:09:05,510 --> 01:09:05,520
yeah i just i just kind of you know i
 

2229
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:07,990

01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,990
really like um choreographies where
there's interactions but as a solo

2232
01:09:09,990 --> 01:09:10,000
there's interactions but as a solo
 

2233
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,030

artist
 

2235
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:12,789
artist
not being able to do that it's kind of

2236
01:09:12,789 --> 01:09:12,799
not being able to do that it's kind of
 

2237
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:14,470
not being able to do that it's kind of
sad because like through interacting

2238
01:09:14,470 --> 01:09:14,480
sad because like through interacting
 

2239
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:16,630
sad because like through interacting
with each other there's so many so many

2240
01:09:16,630 --> 01:09:16,640
with each other there's so many so many
 

2241
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:19,510
with each other there's so many so many
more new moves that you can come up with

2242
01:09:19,510 --> 01:09:19,520
more new moves that you can come up with
 

2243
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:22,390
more new moves that you can come up with
and then also since the song already

2244
01:09:22,390 --> 01:09:22,400
and then also since the song already
 

2245
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:24,470
and then also since the song already
sounds like it should be sung with more

2246
01:09:24,470 --> 01:09:24,480
sounds like it should be sung with more
 

2247
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:27,030
sounds like it should be sung with more
than one person and it's so busy and has

2248
01:09:27,030 --> 01:09:27,040
than one person and it's so busy and has
 

2249
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:29,430
than one person and it's so busy and has
overlapping parts i thought it would be

2250
01:09:29,430 --> 01:09:29,440
overlapping parts i thought it would be
 

2251
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:31,990
overlapping parts i thought it would be
perfect you know those were my thoughts

2252
01:09:31,990 --> 01:09:32,000
perfect you know those were my thoughts
 

2253
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,430
perfect you know those were my thoughts
but then i did the idea because it was

2254
01:09:33,430 --> 01:09:33,440
but then i did the idea because it was
 

2255
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:35,990
but then i did the idea because it was
too much

2256
01:09:35,990 --> 01:09:36,000

 

2257
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,829

so however

2258
01:09:37,829 --> 01:09:37,839
so however
 

2259
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:40,709
