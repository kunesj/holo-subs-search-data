before prior it just means that they
 

3549
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:10,470
before prior it just means that they
were caught at that time how it works I

3550
01:34:10,470 --> 01:34:10,480
were caught at that time how it works I
 

3551
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:12,990
were caught at that time how it works I
do this so it's like
