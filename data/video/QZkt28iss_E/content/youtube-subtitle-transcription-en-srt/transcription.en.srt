like me not understanding something or

so no it's just the screw didn't go in

maybe maybe sometimes maybe the I don't
 

1853
01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:41,390
maybe maybe sometimes maybe the I don't
know something's like a millimeter off

1854
01:08:41,390 --> 01:08:41,400
know something's like a millimeter off
 

1855
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:45,749
know something's like a millimeter off
because the wood is maybe an open could

because the wood is maybe an open could
 

1857
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:48,110
because the wood is maybe an open could
that be or just because I didn't screw

1858
01:08:48,110 --> 01:08:48,120
that be or just because I didn't screw
 

1859
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:51,030
that be or just because I didn't screw

then it's not as tight as it should be

oh well the first thing I can think of
 

5501
03:15:45,000 --> 03:15:47,590
oh well the first thing I can think of
is the Chima dance but I I felt really

5502
03:15:47,590 --> 03:15:47,600
is the Chima dance but I I felt really
 

5503
03:15:47,600 --> 03:15:49,750
