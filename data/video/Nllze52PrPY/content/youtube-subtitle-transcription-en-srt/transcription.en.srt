01:24:08,629 --> 01:24:08,639
before i had some trouble but i think
 

3531
01:24:08,639 --> 01:24:09,910
before i had some trouble but i think
that was cause i didn't have much

3532
01:24:09,910 --> 01:24:09,920
that was cause i didn't have much
 

3533
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:11,110
that was cause i didn't have much
sunlight

3534
01:24:11,110 --> 01:24:11,120
sunlight
 

3535
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:12,310
sunlight
in my

3536
01:24:12,310 --> 01:24:12,320
in my
 

3537
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:13,350
in my
home

3538
01:24:13,350 --> 01:24:13,360
home
 

3539
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:15,430
home
but now i have sunlight so i think i

3540
01:24:15,430 --> 01:24:15,440
but now i have sunlight so i think i
 

3541
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:17,669
but now i have sunlight so i think i
could think i could keep plants alive i

3542
01:24:17,669 --> 01:24:17,679
could think i could keep plants alive i
 

3543
01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:20,149
could think i could keep plants alive i
do keep an animal alive so

3544
01:24:20,149 --> 01:24:20,159
do keep an animal alive so
 

3545
01:24:20,159 --> 01:24:23,310
do keep an animal alive so
it couldn't be too hard

3546
01:24:23,310 --> 01:24:23,320

 

3547
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:26,950

interestingly enough i think keeping an

3548
01:24:26,950 --> 01:24:26,960
interestingly enough i think keeping an
 

3549
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:29,830
interestingly enough i think keeping an
animal alive is actually more easy than

3550
01:24:29,830 --> 01:24:29,840
animal alive is actually more easy than
 

3551
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:31,910
animal alive is actually more easy than
keeping a plant alive i think you might

3552
01:24:31,910 --> 01:24:31,920
keeping a plant alive i think you might
 

3553
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:33,750
keeping a plant alive i think you might
be right because the animal will tell

3554
01:24:33,750 --> 01:24:33,760
be right because the animal will tell
 

3555
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:35,590
be right because the animal will tell
you all the way around the animal

3556
01:24:35,590 --> 01:24:35,600
you all the way around the animal
 

3557
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:37,910
you all the way around the animal
reminds you it needs to eat plants don't

3558
01:24:37,910 --> 01:24:37,920
reminds you it needs to eat plants don't
 

3559
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:39,270
reminds you it needs to eat plants don't
remind you

3560
01:24:39,270 --> 01:24:39,280
remind you
 

3561
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:41,510
