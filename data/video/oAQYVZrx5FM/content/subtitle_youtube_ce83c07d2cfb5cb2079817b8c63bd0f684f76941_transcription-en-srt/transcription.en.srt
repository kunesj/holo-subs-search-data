yeah on this side on this side on our

2620
01:07:51,109 --> 01:07:51,119
yeah on this side on this side on our
 

2621
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:54,029
yeah on this side on this side on our
side okay yeah you do it like a chest

2622
01:07:54,029 --> 01:07:54,039
side okay yeah you do it like a chest
 

2623
01:07:54,039 --> 01:07:56,630
side okay yeah you do it like a chest
maybe for the

2624
01:07:56,630 --> 01:07:56,640
maybe for the
 

2625
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:59,589
maybe for the
okay yeah but it's directly under the

2626

bigger

2632
01:08:04,589 --> 01:08:04,599
bigger
 

2633
01:08:04,599 --> 01:08:07,150
bigger
than so you could make it like off to
