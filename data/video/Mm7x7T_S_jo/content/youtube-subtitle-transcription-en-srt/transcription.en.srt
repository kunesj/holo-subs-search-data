two 12 hour streams back to vacuum but

1412
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:58,000
two 12 hour streams back to vacuum but
 

1413
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,430
two 12 hour streams back to vacuum but
the the the one thing that i noticed is

1414
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:01,440
the the the one thing that i noticed is
 

1415
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,230
the the the one thing that i noticed is
playing a game for long hours playing

1416
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:04,240
playing a game for long hours playing
 

1417
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,670
playing a game for long hours playing

only one game for long hours is much
 

1419
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,790
only one game for long hours is much
more difficult than playing

1420
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:06,800
more difficult than playing
 

1421
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,270
more difficult than playing
several games like a marathon in 12

1422

1433
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,510
also doing a karaoke in between was
actually really really manageable so you

1434
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:21,520
actually really really manageable so you
 

1435
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,470
actually really really manageable so you
could do it as well someday

energy but no it's honestly okay i don't

1464
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:56,240
energy but no it's honestly okay i don't
 

1465

i don't think
 

1467
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,710
i don't think
that is it's not necessary to stream for

1468
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:00,720
that is it's not necessary to stream for
 

1469
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:04,069
that is it's not necessary to stream for
seven or 12 hours really

1470

seven or 12 hours really
 

1471
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:05,430
seven or 12 hours really

what is that what is happening i can't

1534
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:06,880
what is that what is happening i can't
 

1535
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:12,790
what is that what is happening i can't
walk

1536

1537
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,950

i think i'm having a problem right now

1538
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:14,960
i think i'm having a problem right now
 

1539
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:15,910
i think i'm having a problem right now
but it will probably

1540
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:15,920
but it will probably
 

1541
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,109
but it will probably
fix itself against oh

1542
00:44:19,109 --> 00:44:19,119
fix itself against oh
 

1543
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:22,230
fix itself against oh
