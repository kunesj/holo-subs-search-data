don't know
which words to use to explain that so

2046
01:33:45,350 --> 01:33:45,360
which words to use to explain that so
 

2047
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:47,830
which words to use to explain that so
i'm using a microphone that is connected

2048
01:33:47,830 --> 01:33:47,840
i'm using a microphone that is connected
 

2049
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:53,669
i'm using a microphone that is connected
to uh what's it called again

2050
01:33:53,669 --> 01:33:53,679

 

2051
01:33:53,679 --> 01:33:57,830

uh what's it called well a cloud lifter

2052
01:33:57,830 --> 01:33:57,840
uh what's it called well a cloud lifter
 

2053
01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:01,189
uh what's it called well a cloud lifter
and the cloud lifter is connected to

2054
01:34:01,189 --> 01:34:01,199
and the cloud lifter is connected to
 

2055
01:34:01,199 --> 01:34:03,270
and the cloud lifter is connected to
a focusrite what was that again what was

2056
01:34:03,270 --> 01:34:03,280
a focusrite what was that again what was
 

2057
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:04,709
a focusrite what was that again what was
the phone no it's not a mixer

2058
01:34:04,709 --> 01:34:04,719
the phone no it's not a mixer
 

2059
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:06,950
the phone no it's not a mixer
it's not a mixer and that is the thing

2060
01:34:06,950 --> 01:34:06,960
it's not a mixer and that is the thing
 

2061
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:08,310
it's not a mixer and that is the thing
if i had a mixer

2062
01:34:08,310 --> 01:34:08,320
if i had a mixer
 

2063
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:11,350
if i had a mixer
then apparently i would have no problems

2064
01:34:11,350 --> 01:34:11,360
then apparently i would have no problems
 

2065
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:16,390
then apparently i would have no problems
with um with all the audio delay

2066
01:34:16,390 --> 01:34:16,400

 

2067
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:19,110

um yeah i think what i have is an audio

2068
01:34:19,110 --> 01:34:19,120
um yeah i think what i have is an audio
 

2069
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:21,030
um yeah i think what i have is an audio
interface

2070
01:34:21,030 --> 01:34:21,040
interface
 

2071
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:23,590
interface
uh but if i had a mixer then the audio

2072
01:34:23,590 --> 01:34:23,600
uh but if i had a mixer then the audio
 

2073
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:25,510
uh but if i had a mixer then the audio
from the background music would kind of

2074
01:34:25,510 --> 01:34:25,520
from the background music would kind of
 

2075
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:27,350
from the background music would kind of
go through the mixer and my voice would

2076
01:34:27,350 --> 01:34:27,360
go through the mixer and my voice would
 

2077
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:29,510
go through the mixer and my voice would
go for the mixer as well first and

2078
01:34:29,510 --> 01:34:29,520
go for the mixer as well first and
 

2079
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:31,590
go for the mixer as well first and
then it would be synced up i think from

2080
01:34:31,590 --> 01:34:31,600
then it would be synced up i think from
 

2081
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:33,350
then it would be synced up i think from
what i heard at least it was that way in

2082
01:34:33,350 --> 01:34:33,360
what i heard at least it was that way in
 

2083
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:34,950
what i heard at least it was that way in
the studio and

2084
01:34:34,950 --> 01:34:34,960
the studio and
 

2085
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:37,350
the studio and
that's the right way to go but and then

2086
01:34:37,350 --> 01:34:37,360
that's the right way to go but and then
 

2087
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:39,030
that's the right way to go but and then
then i i don't know i'm thinking of

2088
01:34:39,030 --> 01:34:39,040
then i i don't know i'm thinking of
 

2089
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:40,629
then i i don't know i'm thinking of
buying a mixer but i'm not sure what to

2090
01:34:40,629 --> 01:34:40,639
buying a mixer but i'm not sure what to
 

2091
01:34:40,639 --> 01:34:41,430
buying a mixer but i'm not sure what to
buy now

2092
01:34:41,430 --> 01:34:41,440
buy now
 

2093
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:45,350
buy now
it looks so complicated

2094
01:34:45,350 --> 01:34:45,360

 

2095
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:48,870

2097
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:51,109

it sounds like a abrupt static is caused

2098
01:34:51,109 --> 01:34:51,119
it sounds like a abrupt static is caused
 

2099
01:34:51,119 --> 01:34:52,950
it sounds like a abrupt static is caused
by lack of one do you mean those

2103
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:56,310
i've been wondering about that do you
mean those a little uh

2104
01:34:56,310 --> 01:34:56,320

even even it's not even when i peek it's

2108
01:35:02,470 --> 01:35:02,480
even even it's not even when i peek it's
 

2109
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:04,229
even even it's not even when i peek it's
just like randomly

2110
01:35:04,229 --> 01:35:04,239

2111
01:35:04,239 --> 01:35:07,350
just like randomly
is that what you mean

2112
01:35:07,350 --> 01:35:07,360

 

2113
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:08,870

because i've been wondering about that

2114
01:35:08,870 --> 01:35:08,880
because i've been wondering about that
 

2115
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:10,390
because i've been wondering about that
too like

2116
01:35:10,390 --> 01:35:10,400
too like
 

2117
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:13,669
too like
no matter where i record it it's not

2118
01:35:13,669 --> 01:35:13,679
no matter where i record it it's not
 

2119
01:35:13,679 --> 01:35:13,990
no matter where i record it it's not
even

2120
01:35:13,990 --> 01:35:14,000
even
 

2121
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,470
even
only when i stream yeah it's like a

2122
01:35:16,470 --> 01:35:16,480
only when i stream yeah it's like a
 

2123
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:18,390
only when i stream yeah it's like a
popping a tiny popping sound that

2124
01:35:18,390 --> 01:35:18,400
popping a tiny popping sound that
 

2125
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:19,669
popping a tiny popping sound that
happens every once in a while

2126
01:35:19,669 --> 01:35:19,679
happens every once in a while
 

2127
01:35:19,679 --> 01:35:21,270
happens every once in a while
and i have no idea why that is because

2128
01:35:21,270 --> 01:35:21,280
and i have no idea why that is because
 

2129
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:23,510
and i have no idea why that is because
