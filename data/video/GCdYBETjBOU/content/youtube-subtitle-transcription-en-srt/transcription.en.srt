no I wasn't even traveling that far
um it wasn't even that far

4356
02:04:15,770 --> 02:04:15,780
um it wasn't even that far
 

4357
02:04:15,780 --> 02:04:18,109
um it wasn't even that far
but still

4358
02:04:18,109 --> 02:04:18,119
but still
 

4359
02:04:18,119 --> 02:04:20,149
but still
yeah

4360
02:04:20,149 --> 02:04:20,159
yeah
 

4361
02:04:20,159 --> 02:04:22,490
yeah
um so when I saw that the next one it

4362
02:04:22,490 --> 02:04:22,500
um so when I saw that the next one it
 

4363
02:04:22,500 --> 02:04:24,050
um so when I saw that the next one it
would take 14 minutes as well I was like

4364
02:04:24,050 --> 02:04:24,060
would take 14 minutes as well I was like
 

4365
02:04:24,060 --> 02:04:25,729
would take 14 minutes as well I was like
[\h__\h] I need a different solution this is

4366
02:04:25,729 --> 02:04:25,739
[\h__\h] I need a different solution this is
 

4367
02:04:25,739 --> 02:04:28,430
[\h__\h] I need a different solution this is
not gonna work

4368
02:04:28,430 --> 02:04:28,440

 

4369
02:04:28,440 --> 02:04:31,850

so I canceled that one myself

4370
02:04:31,850 --> 02:04:31,860
so I canceled that one myself
 

4371
02:04:31,860 --> 02:04:34,430
so I canceled that one myself
and I think I was charged for that one

4372
02:04:34,430 --> 02:04:34,440
and I think I was charged for that one
 

4373
02:04:34,440 --> 02:04:37,310
and I think I was charged for that one
because he was supposedly already on the

4374
02:04:37,310 --> 02:04:37,320
because he was supposedly already on the
 

4375
02:04:37,320 --> 02:04:39,350
because he was supposedly already on the
way to me but I think that one was about

4376
02:04:39,350 --> 02:04:39,360
way to me but I think that one was about
 

4377
02:04:39,360 --> 02:04:42,229
way to me but I think that one was about
to first uh

4378
02:04:42,229 --> 02:04:42,239

4383
02:04:46,980 --> 02:04:48,470
or the other way this way should I check
out the other one first

4384
02:04:48,470 --> 02:04:48,480
out the other one first
 

4385
02:04:48,480 --> 02:04:50,870
out the other one first

4481
02:07:14,219 --> 02:07:15,770

um I didn't have the app or anything

4482
02:07:15,770 --> 02:07:15,780
um I didn't have the app or anything
 

4483
02:07:15,780 --> 02:07:18,470
um I didn't have the app or anything
either but I figured this was my only

4484
02:07:18,470 --> 02:07:18,480
either but I figured this was my only
 

4485
02:07:18,480 --> 02:07:21,770
either but I figured this was my only
choice to be somewhat on time

4486
02:07:21,770 --> 02:07:21,780
choice to be somewhat on time
 

4487
02:07:21,780 --> 02:07:24,890
choice to be somewhat on time
so I quickly I scrambled and I tried to

4488
02:07:24,890 --> 02:07:24,900
so I quickly I scrambled and I tried to
 

4489
02:07:24,900 --> 02:07:27,770
so I quickly I scrambled and I tried to
quickly download the app and register my

4490
02:07:27,770 --> 02:07:27,780
quickly download the app and register my
 

4491
02:07:27,780 --> 02:07:30,589
quickly download the app and register my
payment method and all of that and that

4492
02:07:30,589 --> 02:07:30,599
payment method and all of that and that
 

4493
02:07:30,599 --> 02:07:32,810
payment method and all of that and that
took me like five minutes I think so I

4494
02:07:32,810 --> 02:07:32,820
took me like five minutes I think so I
 

4495
02:07:32,820 --> 02:07:35,149
took me like five minutes I think so I
only lost five minutes for that stupid

4496
02:07:35,149 --> 02:07:35,159
only lost five minutes for that stupid
 

4497

02:10:29,510 --> 02:10:29,520
following the map without it even
 

4623
02:10:29,520 --> 02:10:31,669
following the map without it even
functioning properly

02:10:31,669 --> 02:10:31,679
functioning properly
 

4625
02:10:31,679 --> 02:10:37,189
functioning properly
properly but I made one one mistake

4626
02:10:37,189 --> 02:10:37,199

 

4627
02:10:37,199 --> 02:10:42,169

I still had the roots set to

02:10:42,169 --> 02:10:42,179
I still had the roots set to
 

4629
02:10:42,179 --> 02:10:43,669
I still had the roots set to
um

4630
02:10:43,669 --> 02:10:43,679
um
 

4631
02:10:43,679 --> 02:10:47,330

02:10:47,330 --> 02:10:47,340
as if I was going by foot
 

4633
02:10:47,340 --> 02:10:53,930

5181
02:23:44,580 --> 02:23:46,429
suddenly didn't want to move anymore and
then I tried scanning the code again

5182
02:23:46,429 --> 02:23:46,439
then I tried scanning the code again
 

5183
02:23:46,439 --> 02:23:49,370
then I tried scanning the code again
because they have a like a code on it

5184
02:23:49,370 --> 02:23:49,380
because they have a like a code on it
 

5185
02:23:49,380 --> 02:23:53,270
because they have a like a code on it
that you have to scan before starting

5186
02:23:53,270 --> 02:23:53,280
that you have to scan before starting
 

5187
02:23:53,280 --> 02:23:56,870
that you have to scan before starting
and uh

5188
02:23:56,870 --> 02:23:56,880

 

5189
02:23:56,880 --> 02:23:59,030

when I scanned the code it said this

5190
02:23:59,030 --> 02:23:59,040
when I scanned the code it said this
 

5191
02:23:59,040 --> 02:24:03,290
when I scanned the code it said this
this vehicle is not usable anymore

5192
02:24:03,290 --> 02:24:03,300
this vehicle is not usable anymore
 

5193
02:24:03,300 --> 02:24:07,250

I hope so
 

10357
04:44:08,340 --> 04:44:09,830
I hope so
also because

10358
04:44:09,830 --> 04:44:09,840
also because
 

10359
04:44:09,840 --> 04:44:12,770
also because
um

10360
04:44:12,770 --> 04:44:12,780

 

10361
04:44:12,780 --> 04:44:15,708

you know being in the Maldives kind of

10362
04:44:15,708 --> 04:44:15,718
you know being in the Maldives kind of
 

10363
04:44:15,718 --> 04:44:17,930
you know being in the Maldives kind of
keeps me from doing a certain

10364
04:44:17,930 --> 04:44:17,940
keeps me from doing a certain
 

10365
04:44:17,940 --> 04:44:19,730
keeps me from doing a certain
amount of work

10366
04:44:19,730 --> 04:44:19,740
amount of work
 

10367
04:44:19,740 --> 04:44:22,128
amount of work
and then I also feel like I have to

10368
04:44:22,128 --> 04:44:22,138
and then I also feel like I have to
 

10369
04:44:22,138 --> 04:44:25,128
and then I also feel like I have to
prepare for that

10370
04:44:25,128 --> 04:44:25,138

 

10371
04:44:25,138 --> 04:44:26,930

so

10372
04:44:26,930 --> 04:44:26,940
so
 

10373
04:44:26,940 --> 04:44:30,288
so
do some extra content before I go and

10374
04:44:30,288 --> 04:44:30,298
do some extra content before I go and
 

10375
04:44:30,298 --> 04:44:32,448
do some extra content before I go and
then afterwards do some more content to

04:44:32,448 --> 04:44:32,458
then afterwards do some more content to
 

10377
04:44:32,458 --> 04:44:34,390
then afterwards do some more content to
kind of make up for not being there too

04:44:34,390 --> 04:44:34,400
kind of make up for not being there too
