00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:02,680
because Kima as you may know I recorded
 

177
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,550
because Kima as you may know I recorded
it at home with my accents and

178
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:05,560
it at home with my accents and
 

179
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,870
it at home with my accents and
apparently the motion data was so janky

180
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:08,880
apparently the motion data was so janky
 

181
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,470
apparently the motion data was so janky
and scuffed no matter what I did that it

182
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:12,480
and scuffed no matter what I did that it
 

183
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,509
and scuffed no matter what I did that it
wasn't usable like at least not with

184
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:15,519
wasn't usable like at least not with
 

185
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,949
wasn't usable like at least not with
many Cuts in between and even then it

186
00:09:17,949 --> 00:09:17,959
many Cuts in between and even then it
 

187
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:20,150
many Cuts in between and even then it
would look shitty that's why it didn't

188
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:20,160
would look shitty that's why it didn't
 

189
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,870
would look shitty that's why it didn't
happen back then um but for Mirage I was

happen back then um but for Mirage I was
 

191
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,470
happen back then um but for Mirage I was
able to just use the motion data from

192
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:25,480
able to just use the motion data from
 

193
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,430
able to just use the motion data from
the

194
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:26,440
the
 

195
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,389
the
studio when I recorded it there

it's a choreo graphy thing maybe Chima

214
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:01,720
it's a choreo graphy thing maybe Chima
 

215
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,710
it's a choreo graphy thing maybe Chima
had a lot of movements that would make

216
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:04,720
had a lot of movements that would make
 

217
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,110
had a lot of movements that would make
it more janky it was more intense

218
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:07,120
it more janky it was more intense
 

219

it more janky it was more intense
honestly I don't know what your

220
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:08,440
honestly I don't know what your
 

221
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,350

to the backup dancers I really think

226
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:15,200
to the backup dancers I really think
 

227
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,630
to the backup dancers I really think
that is the case

228
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:17,640
that is the case
 

229
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,030
that is the case
but um actually Kima is way more

230
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,040
but um actually Kima is way more
 

231
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,630
but um actually Kima is way more
intricate and intense so I

232
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:24,640
intricate and intense so I
 

233
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,069
intricate and intense so I
think the tracking it's not so much that

234
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:28,079
think the tracking it's not so much that
 

235
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,949
think the tracking it's not so much that
the tracking can't keep up it's more

236
00:10:29,949 --> 00:10:29,959
the tracking can't keep up it's more
 

237
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:31,710
the tracking can't keep up it's more
like

238
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:31,720

the problem is that okay no matter how
 

343
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,710
the problem is that okay no matter how
good the motion capture is

344
00:12:59,710 --> 00:12:59,720
good the motion capture is
 

345
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,030
good the motion capture is
it's difficult to show it very

346
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:02,040
it's difficult to show it very
 

347
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,470
it's difficult to show it very
accurately I want to if you're learning

348
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:04,480
accurately I want to if you're learning
 

349
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,790
accurately I want to if you're learning
it right now let me give you one uh tip

350
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:07,800
it right now let me give you one uh tip
 

351
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,269
it right now let me give you one uh tip
uh the moment

352
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:09,279
uh the moment
 

353
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,670
uh the moment
the ru part

354
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:11,680
the ru part
 

355
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,189
the ru part
starts the I'm pointing two piece like

356
00:13:15,189 --> 00:13:15,199
starts the I'm pointing two piece like
 

357
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:20,189
starts the I'm pointing two piece like
like okay both hands are in a piece sign

358
00:13:20,189 --> 00:13:20,199
like okay both hands are in a piece sign
 

359
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:21,629
like okay both hands are in a piece sign
and I'm pointing it

360
00:13:21,629 --> 00:13:21,639
and I'm pointing it
 

361
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:24,949
and I'm pointing it
down uh on the side of my hip pointing

362
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:24,959
down uh on the side of my hip pointing
 

363
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:29,110
down uh on the side of my hip pointing
it downwards connecting it to a shape

364
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:29,120
it downwards connecting it to a shape
 

365
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,710
it downwards connecting it to a shape
shape an M I don't know if people

366
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:31,720
shape an M I don't know if people
 

367
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,389
shape an M I don't know if people
noticed that it's supposed to shape an

368
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:34,399
noticed that it's supposed to shape an
 

369
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,870
noticed that it's supposed to shape an
M that's where how it starts in that

370
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:36,880
M that's where how it starts in that
 

371
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,389
M that's where how it starts in that
position and then I'm pulling the the

372
00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:39,399
position and then I'm pulling the the
 

373
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:44,189
position and then I'm pulling the the
two pieces apart at the first m is a m

374
00:13:44,189 --> 00:13:44,199
two pieces apart at the first m is a m
 

375
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:47,069
two pieces apart at the first m is a m
then at the the second me I think I'm

376
00:13:47,069 --> 00:13:47,079
then at the the second me I think I'm
 

377
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:49,470
then at the the second me I think I'm
pulling them apart one after another me

378
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:49,480
pulling them apart one after another me
 

379
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,629
pulling them apart one after another me
me me me you know and then I'm bringing

380
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:52,639
me me me you know and then I'm bringing
 

381
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,350
me me me you know and then I'm bringing
them over at the top on on my head but

382
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:55,360
them over at the top on on my head but
 

383
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,949
them over at the top on on my head but
then then the PE signs are already

384
00:13:56,949 --> 00:13:56,959
then then the PE signs are already
 

385
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,389
then then the PE signs are already
disappearing I think but in the very

386
00:13:58,389 --> 00:13:58,399
disappearing I think but in the very
 

387
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,870
disappearing I think but in the very
beginning it's starts with the m and

388
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:00,880
beginning it's starts with the m and
 

389
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,629
beginning it's starts with the m and
then uh one goes to the other side of my

390
00:14:03,629 --> 00:14:03,639
then uh one goes to the other side of my
 

391
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:05,829
then uh one goes to the other side of my
hip and then

392
00:14:05,829 --> 00:14:05,839
hip and then
 

393
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,590
hip and then
wait oh yeah I'm just like separating

394
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:08,600
wait oh yeah I'm just like separating
 

395
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,350
wait oh yeah I'm just like separating
them basically one to the right one to

396
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:10,360
them basically one to the right one to
 

397
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,189
them basically one to the right one to
the left H I don't know if it really

398
00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:13,199
the left H I don't know if it really
 

399
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,949
the left H I don't know if it really
looks like an m in the motion capture

400
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:14,959
looks like an m in the motion capture
 

401
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,269
looks like an m in the motion capture
that's the problem I don't think it

402
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:16,279
that's the problem I don't think it
 

403
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:20,269
that's the problem I don't think it
looks like an M unless I mean honestly

404
00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:20,279
looks like an M unless I mean honestly
 

405
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:22,910
looks like an M unless I mean honestly
it's not it didn't look too bad but

406
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:22,920
it's not it didn't look too bad but
 

407
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,990
it's not it didn't look too bad but
maybe they're a little bit too far apart

408
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:25,000
maybe they're a little bit too far apart
 

409
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,150
maybe they're a little bit too far apart
so that it doesn't look like I'm

410
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,160
so that it doesn't look like I'm
 

411
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,380
so that it doesn't look like I'm
connecting them

412
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:28,390
connecting them
 

413
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,030
connecting them

[Music]
 

415
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,189
[Music]
but yeah that's what's happening but

416
00:14:31,189 --> 00:14:31,199
but yeah that's what's happening but
 

417
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,509
but yeah that's what's happening but
don't worry about it like anybody who

418
00:14:32,509 --> 00:14:32,519
don't worry about it like anybody who
 

419
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:35,550
don't worry about it like anybody who
wants to cover it you can um I know it's

420
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:35,560
wants to cover it you can um I know it's
 

421
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,870
wants to cover it you can um I know it's
difficult to learn a Coro from a

422
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:39,880
difficult to learn a Coro from a
 

423
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,550
difficult to learn a Coro from a
3D footage cuz it's never going to be as

424
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:43,560
3D footage cuz it's never going to be as
 

425
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:48,389
3D footage cuz it's never going to be as
accurate as the real people dancing

426
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:48,399
accurate as the real people dancing
 

427

1322
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:28,480
I I get it I understand why she chose to
 

1323
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,750
I I get it I understand why she chose to
do this and

1324
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:31,760
do this and
 

1325
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,470
do this and
um I've said this several times before I

1326
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:35,480
um I've said this several times before I
 

1327
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,190

don't think any of us thought we would

1328
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:37,200
don't think any of us thought we would
 

1329
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,990
don't think any of us thought we would
do it this long the fact that we have

1330
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:39,000
do it this long the fact that we have
 

1331
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,030
do it this long the fact that we have
been doing it for 4 years now is already

1332
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:43,040
been doing it for 4 years now is already
 

1333
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:49,630
been doing it for 4 years now is already
I think worth a lot of respect

1334
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:49,640

 

1335
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,230

and you know it's a long time to be

1336
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:52,240
and you know it's a long time to be
 

1337
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,309
and you know it's a long time to be
doing

1338
00:38:53,309 --> 00:38:53,319
doing
 

1339
00:38:53,319 --> 00:38:58,630
doing
this kind of entertainment job and

1340
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:58,640
this kind of entertainment job and
 

1341
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,309
this kind of entertainment job and
I I I think it's it's at a point where

1342
00:39:01,309 --> 00:39:01,319
I I I think it's it's at a point where
 

1343
00:39:01,319 --> 00:39:04,790
I I I think it's it's at a point where
it it might be normal that somebody

1344
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:04,800
it it might be normal that somebody
 

1345
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,309
it it might be normal that somebody
wants to move

1346
00:39:06,309 --> 00:39:06,319
wants to move
 

1347
00:39:06,319 --> 00:39:07,870
wants to move
on

but I can make a cement mixer now which

6798
03:12:51,070 --> 03:12:51,080
but I can make a cement mixer now which
 

6799
03:12:51,080 --> 03:12:54,670
but I can make a cement mixer now which
with that we could make cement walls in

6800
03:12:54,670 --> 03:12:54,680
with that we could make cement walls in
 

6801
03:12:54,680 --> 03:12:58,030
with that we could make cement walls in
Fury but my next reward that I can uh

6802
03:12:58,030 --> 03:12:58,040
Fury but my next reward that I can uh
 

6803
03:12:58,040 --> 03:13:00,349
Fury but my next reward that I can uh
make is a chemistry station and then a

6804
03:13:00,349 --> 03:13:00,359
make is a chemistry station and then a
 

6805
03:13:00,359 --> 03:13:02,750
make is a chemistry station and then a
crucible so it's very far my chemistry

6806
03:13:02,750 --> 03:13:02,760
crucible so it's very far my chemistry
 

6807
03:13:02,760 --> 03:13:08,269
crucible so it's very far my chemistry
station's good yeah it will be

6808
03:13:08,269 --> 03:13:08,279

 

6809
03:13:08,279 --> 03:13:13,550

good get that in

6810
03:13:13,550 --> 03:13:13,560

 

6811
03:13:13,560 --> 03:13:20,309

there and

6812

6813
03:13:20,319 --> 03:13:22,550

uh oh it's loading up

6814
03:13:22,550 --> 03:13:22,560
uh oh it's loading up
 

6815
03:13:22,560 --> 03:13:30,030
uh oh it's loading up
slowly

6816
03:13:30,030 --> 03:13:30,040

 

6817
03:13:30,040 --> 03:13:36,030

okay okay not enough deal so I

6818
03:13:36,030 --> 03:13:36,040
okay okay not enough deal so I
 

6819
03:13:36,040 --> 03:13:40,349
okay okay not enough deal so I
think I have to make a lower level

6820
03:13:40,349 --> 03:13:40,359
think I have to make a lower level
 

6821
03:13:40,359 --> 03:13:47,710
think I have to make a lower level
one which will be good enough

6822
03:13:47,710 --> 03:13:47,720

 

6823
03:13:47,720 --> 03:13:49,349

chemistry station will be great to

6824
03:13:49,349 --> 03:13:49,359
chemistry station will be great to
 

6825
03:13:49,359 --> 03:13:52,750
chemistry station will be great to
reduce material consumption

6826
03:13:52,750 --> 03:13:52,760
reduce material consumption
 

6827
03:13:52,760 --> 03:13:54,990
reduce material consumption
okay everyone donates you'll get to buy

6828
03:13:54,990 --> 03:13:55,000
okay everyone donates you'll get to buy
 

6829
03:13:55,000 --> 03:13:57,469
okay everyone donates you'll get to buy
the CR yeah but I haven't seen a Trader

6830
03:13:57,469 --> 03:13:57,479
the CR yeah but I haven't seen a Trader
 

6831
03:13:57,479 --> 03:14:00,389
the CR yeah but I haven't seen a Trader
selling it yet oh maybe the one in the

6832
03:14:00,389 --> 03:14:00,399
selling it yet oh maybe the one in the
 

6833
03:14:00,399 --> 03:14:03,150
selling it yet oh maybe the one in the
in the next Zone will have it yeah

6834
03:14:03,150 --> 03:14:03,160
in the next Zone will have it yeah
 

6835
03:14:03,160 --> 03:14:04,910
in the next Zone will have it yeah
probably like I it wouldn't make sense

6836
03:14:04,910 --> 03:14:04,920
probably like I it wouldn't make sense
 

6837
03:14:04,920 --> 03:14:08,030
probably like I it wouldn't make sense
for them to sell it so early in the game

6838
03:14:08,030 --> 03:14:08,040
for them to sell it so early in the game
 

6839
03:14:08,040 --> 03:14:10,550
for them to sell it so early in the game
when we I can't even like I'm way too

6840
03:14:10,550 --> 03:14:10,560
when we I can't even like I'm way too
 

6841
03:14:10,560 --> 03:14:12,429
when we I can't even like I'm way too
far from crafting it myself they

6842
03:14:12,429 --> 03:14:12,439
far from crafting it myself they
 

6843
03:14:12,439 --> 03:14:15,150
far from crafting it myself they
probably want to balance that out so

6844
03:14:15,150 --> 03:14:15,160
probably want to balance that out so
 

6845
03:14:15,160 --> 03:14:17,990
probably want to balance that out so
that you don't get it too early

6846
03:14:17,990 --> 03:14:18,000
that you don't get it too early
 

6847
03:14:18,000 --> 03:14:20,830
that you don't get it too early
so yeah probably in the mountain area

6848
03:14:20,830 --> 03:14:20,840
so yeah probably in the mountain area
 

6849
03:14:20,840 --> 03:14:22,630
so yeah probably in the mountain area
there's a

6850
03:14:22,630 --> 03:14:22,640
there's a
 

6851
03:14:22,640 --> 03:14:27,670
there's a
chance Bob usually has it Bob really Bob

6852
03:14:27,670 --> 03:14:27,680
chance Bob usually has it Bob really Bob
 

6853
03:14:27,680 --> 03:14:30,429
chance Bob usually has it Bob really Bob
got to check Bobby more often I think we

6854
03:14:30,429 --> 03:14:30,439
got to check Bobby more often I think we
 

6855
03:14:30,439 --> 03:14:33,070
got to check Bobby more often I think we
could farm that much money easily it

6856
03:14:33,070 --> 03:14:33,080
could farm that much money easily it
 

6857
03:14:33,080 --> 03:14:35,990
could farm that much money easily it
might be worth it yeah yeah the the

6858
03:14:35,990 --> 03:14:36,000
might be worth it yeah yeah the the
 

6859
03:14:36,000 --> 03:14:38,910
might be worth it yeah yeah the the
higher the tier Quest the more like

6860
03:14:38,910 --> 03:14:38,920
higher the tier Quest the more like
 

6861

9273
04:21:22,880 --> 04:21:25,790
yeah but you you can make bullet casings
in the Forge mhm with the brass I guess

9274
04:21:25,790 --> 04:21:25,800
in the Forge mhm with the brass I guess
 

9275
04:21:25,800 --> 04:21:27,469
in the Forge mhm with the brass I guess
oh with brass and clay and we have so

9276
04:21:27,469 --> 04:21:27,479
oh with brass and clay and we have so
 

9277

much of that mhm
so that's

9280
04:21:32,590 --> 04:21:32,600
so that's
 

9281
04:21:32,600 --> 04:21:36,550
so that's
easy so just bullet tip and gunpowder
