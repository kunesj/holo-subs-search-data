do do you I I can't see the pattern

7686
03:08:29,990 --> 03:08:30,000

 

7687
03:08:30,000 --> 03:08:32,150

7715
03:09:25,080 --> 03:09:28,429

Cube maybe work both sides to one side

7716
03:09:28,429 --> 03:09:28,439
Cube maybe work both sides to one side
 

7717
03:09:28,439 --> 03:09:29,910
Cube maybe work both sides to one side
just keep wrapping it around maybe if

7718
03:09:29,910 --> 03:09:29,920
just keep wrapping it around maybe if
 

7719
03:09:29,920 --> 03:09:31,870
just keep wrapping it around maybe if
you go from one side wrap all the way

7720
03:09:31,870 --> 03:09:31,880
you go from one side wrap all the way
 

7721
03:09:31,880 --> 03:09:34,870
you go from one side wrap all the way
around and solve it that way oh no the

7722
03:09:34,870 --> 03:09:34,880
around and solve it that way oh no the
 

7723
03:09:34,880 --> 03:09:37,190
around and solve it that way oh no the
one side that was full is no no no
