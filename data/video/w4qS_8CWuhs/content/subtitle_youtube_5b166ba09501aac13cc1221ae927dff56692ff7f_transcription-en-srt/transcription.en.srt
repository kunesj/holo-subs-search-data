that I did that
 

1381

that I did that
alone because I always had a

1382
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:04,440
alone because I always had a
 

1383
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:08,950
alone because I always had a
feeling um that it might be from my

1384
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:08,960
feeling um that it might be from my
 

1385
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,270
feeling um that it might be from my
cintique

1386
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:11,280
cintique
 

1387
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,829
cintique
because like

1388
00:42:13,829 --> 00:42:13,839
because like
 

1389
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:16,309
because like
some like whenever I would draw on my

1390
00:42:16,309 --> 00:42:16,319
some like whenever I would draw on my
 

1391
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:19,790
some like whenever I would draw on my
cinti it would also always be really

1392
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:19,800
cinti it would also always be really
 

1393
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:23,150
cinti it would also always be really
weird like weirdly disconnecting itself

1394
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:23,160
weird like weirdly disconnecting itself
 

1395
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:27,390
weird like weirdly disconnecting itself
and and then the the my my pen would

1396
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:27,400
and and then the the my my pen would
 

1397
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,109
and and then the the my my pen would
work on it anymore and it would always

1398
00:42:29,109 --> 00:42:29,119
work on it anymore and it would always
 

1399
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:31,309
work on it anymore and it would always
throw me back to the other monitor

1400
00:42:31,309 --> 00:42:31,319
throw me back to the other monitor
 

1401
00:42:31,319 --> 00:42:33,190
throw me back to the other monitor
without the monitor turning itself off

1402
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:33,200
without the monitor turning itself off
 

1403
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,470
without the monitor turning itself off
though the CTI did never turn itself off

1404
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:35,480
though the CTI did never turn itself off
 

1405
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,030
though the CTI did never turn itself off
but it just like kind of disconnected my

1406
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:37,040
but it just like kind of disconnected my
 

1407
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,990
but it just like kind of disconnected my
pen and I thought that was weird for a

1408
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:40,000
pen and I thought that was weird for a
 

1409
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,870
pen and I thought that was weird for a
while um but I had a feeling this was

1410
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:43,880
while um but I had a feeling this was
 

1411
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,470
while um but I had a feeling this was
kind of being

1412
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:45,480
kind of being
 

1413
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:49,750

troubleshooted during the stream and
 

1417
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,030
troubleshooted during the stream and
like disconnected and and reconnected

1418
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:54,040
like disconnected and and reconnected
 

1419
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,910
like disconnected and and reconnected
the cables it didn't fix the problem and

1420
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:55,920
the cables it didn't fix the problem and
 

1421
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,829
the cables it didn't fix the problem and
even when I wouldn't move anything I

1422
00:42:57,829 --> 00:42:57,839
even when I wouldn't move anything I
 

1423
00:42:57,839 --> 00:42:59,430
even when I wouldn't move anything I
swear when I was just like sitting there

1424
00:42:59,430 --> 00:42:59,440
swear when I was just like sitting there
 

1425
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,430
swear when I was just like sitting there
in silence not moving anything it would

1426
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:02,440
in silence not moving anything it would
 

1427
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,670
in silence not moving anything it would
still randomly randomly start doing that

1428
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:04,680
still randomly randomly start doing that
 

1429
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,390
still randomly randomly start doing that
so that that really makes you wonder

1430
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:06,400
so that that really makes you wonder
 

1431
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:11,190
so that that really makes you wonder
like what is going on um but then I uh I

1432
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:11,200
like what is going on um but then I uh I
 

1433
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,710
like what is going on um but then I uh I
tried troubleshooting it properly and I

1434
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:13,720
tried troubleshooting it properly and I
 

1435
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:16,829
tried troubleshooting it properly and I
I um installed a program that shows me

1436
00:43:16,829 --> 00:43:16,839
I um installed a program that shows me
 

1437
00:43:16,839 --> 00:43:19,030
I um installed a program that shows me
all the disconnects and connects of the

1438
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:19,040
all the disconnects and connects of the
 

1439
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,069
all the disconnects and connects of the
USB but that was

1440
00:43:21,069 --> 00:43:21,079
USB but that was
 

1441
00:43:21,079 --> 00:43:22,790
USB but that was
confusing

1442
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:22,800
confusing
 

1443
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,829
confusing
because it showed all kinds of different

1444
00:43:25,829 --> 00:43:25,839
because it showed all kinds of different
 

1445
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:27,670
because it showed all kinds of different
ones

it's on this like arm mounted arm and it

1474
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:06,480
it's on this like arm mounted arm and it
 

1475
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,790
it's on this like arm mounted arm and it
wouldn't really fix it and then I

1476
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:07,800
wouldn't really fix it and then I
 

1477
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,430
wouldn't really fix it and then I
figured you know

1478
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:10,440
figured you know
 

1479
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,510
figured you know
what

1480
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:12,520
what
 

1481
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,349

um
 

1485
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:20,069
um
RBF cable binded my setup a while

1486
00:44:20,069 --> 00:44:20,079
RBF cable binded my setup a while
 

1487
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:24,549
RBF cable binded my setup a while
ago and the cables for the

1488
00:44:24,549 --> 00:44:24,559
ago and the cables for the
 

1489
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:28,589
ago and the cables for the
cintique he bound them around the

1490
00:44:28,589 --> 00:44:28,599
cintique he bound them around the
 

1491
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:32,109
cintique he bound them around the
cintique boom arm or so however you call

1492
00:44:32,109 --> 00:44:32,119
cintique boom arm or so however you call
 

1493
00:44:32,119 --> 00:44:33,950
cintique boom arm or so however you call
these like mounting

1494
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:33,960
these like mounting
 

1495
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:37,549
these like mounting
arms and it looked to

1496
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:37,559
arms and it looked to
 

1497
00:44:37,559 --> 00:44:42,069
arms and it looked to
me like it was very tight and

1498
00:44:42,069 --> 00:44:42,079
me like it was very tight and
 

1499
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:44,349
me like it was very tight and
restricting so I thought well this looks

1500
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:44,359
restricting so I thought well this looks
 

1501
00:44:44,359 --> 00:44:48,510
restricting so I thought well this looks
nice but let's cut the cable binders and

1502
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:48,520
nice but let's cut the cable binders and
 

1503
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,069
nice but let's cut the cable binders and
then I saw the cable binders made a

1504
00:44:51,069 --> 00:44:51,079
then I saw the cable binders made a
 

1505
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:55,030
then I saw the cable binders made a
little dent on one of the threee cables

1506
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:55,040
little dent on one of the threee cables
 

1507
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,630
little dent on one of the threee cables
there's threee cables connected to the

1508
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:56,640
there's threee cables connected to the
 

1509
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,510
there's threee cables connected to the
cinti

1510
00:44:58,510 --> 00:44:58,520
cinti
 

1511
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:01,349
cinti
going down to the PC and when I cut the

1512
00:45:01,349 --> 00:45:01,359
going down to the PC and when I cut the
 

1513
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:03,870
going down to the PC and when I cut the
cable binders there were several ones

1514
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:03,880
cable binders there were several ones
 

1515
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,349
cable binders there were several ones
and there was a little dent on the cable

1516
00:45:06,349 --> 00:45:06,359
and there was a little dent on the cable
 

1517
00:45:06,359 --> 00:45:09,510
and there was a little dent on the cable
on one of them at least that was very

1518
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:09,520
on one of them at least that was very
 

1519
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,230
on one of them at least that was very
visible

1520
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:11,240
visible
 

1521
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:14,390
visible
and yeah just generally the probably the

1522
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:14,400
and yeah just generally the probably the
 

1523
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,990
and yeah just generally the probably the
tightness and the Restriction of how it

1524
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:18,000
tightness and the Restriction of how it
 

1525
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,109
tightness and the Restriction of how it
was so

1526
00:45:20,109 --> 00:45:20,119
was so
 

1527
00:45:20,119 --> 00:45:22,430
was so
restricted was probably an issue because

1528
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:22,440
restricted was probably an issue because
 

1529
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:25,109
restricted was probably an issue because
immediately after I undid the cable

1530
00:45:25,109 --> 00:45:25,119
immediately after I undid the cable
 

1531
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:26,970
immediately after I undid the cable
binders the problem was gone

1532
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:26,980

00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:02,280
replace all of
 

1631
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:05,430
replace all of
them just to make everything wider but I

1632
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:05,440

to but even if I replace the monitors
 

1637
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,390
to but even if I replace the monitors
then I still have the cintique which is

1638
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:12,400
then I still have the cintique which is
 

1639
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,270
then I still have the cintique which is
black

1640
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:14,280
black
 

1641
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:17,069
black
so I think nowadays there there's a

1642
00:48:17,069 --> 00:48:17,079
so I think nowadays there there's a
 

1643
00:48:17,079 --> 00:48:19,950
so I think nowadays there there's a
white scentique maybe or there's at

1644
00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:19,960
white scentique maybe or there's at
 

1645
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:24,950
white scentique maybe or there's at
least different brands that make white

1646
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:24,960

 

1647
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,750

1657
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,430
else but I don't think there's there's
probably no decal specifically for these

1658
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:43,440
probably no decal specifically for these
 

1659

first like there was one song that I
planned to do that wasn't like it was it

14570
06:46:41,110 --> 06:46:41,120
planned to do that wasn't like it was it
 

14571
06:46:41,120 --> 06:46:42,548
planned to do that wasn't like it was it
was going to be a cover song but it

14572
06:46:42,548 --> 06:46:42,558
was going to be a cover song but it
 

14573
06:46:42,558 --> 06:46:44,628
was going to be a cover song but it
wasn't released yet and that was also

14574

wasn't released yet and that was also
 

14575
06:46:44,638 --> 06:46:46,868
wasn't released yet and that was also
like a bit of a problem because it kept

14576
06:46:46,868 --> 06:46:46,878
like a bit of a problem because it kept
 

14577
06:46:46,878 --> 06:46:49,270
like a bit of a problem because it kept
them getting delayed

14578
06:46:49,270 --> 06:46:49,280
them getting delayed
 

14579
06:46:49,280 --> 06:46:53,548
them getting delayed
mhm so then at some point the the staff

14580
06:46:53,548 --> 06:46:53,558
mhm so then at some point the the staff
 

14581
06:46:53,558 --> 06:46:56,910
mhm so then at some point the the staff
was like H we maybe should replace this

14582
06:46:56,910 --> 06:46:56,920
was like H we maybe should replace this
 

14583
