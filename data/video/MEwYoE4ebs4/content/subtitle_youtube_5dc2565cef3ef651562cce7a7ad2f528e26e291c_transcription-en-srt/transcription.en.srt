Highway

8314
03:34:14,510 --> 03:34:14,520
Highway
 

8315
03:34:14,520 --> 03:34:17,090
Highway
we're pretty low I mean there were some

8316
03:34:17,090 --> 03:34:17,100
we're pretty low I mean there were some
 

8317
03:34:17,100 --> 03:34:18,469
we're pretty low I mean there were some
walls but

8318
03:34:18,469 --> 03:34:18,479
walls but
 

8319
03:34:18,479 --> 03:34:20,690
walls but
pretty low so a deer could jump over it

8320
03:34:20,690 --> 03:34:20,700
pretty low so a deer could jump over it
 

8321
03:34:20,700 --> 03:34:23,450
pretty low so a deer could jump over it
and I was thinking like Wyatt why don't

8322
03:34:23,450 --> 03:34:23,460
and I was thinking like Wyatt why don't
 

8323
03:34:23,460 --> 03:34:26,510
and I was thinking like Wyatt why don't
we make the highways was like really

8324
03:34:26,510 --> 03:34:26,520
we make the highways was like really
 

8325
03:34:26,520 --> 03:34:30,110
we make the highways was like really
high walls all the time

8326
03:34:30,110 --> 03:34:30,120
high walls all the time
 

8327
03:34:30,120 --> 03:34:32,150
high walls all the time
so that this doesn't happen

8328
03:34:32,150 --> 03:34:32,160
so that this doesn't happen
 

8329
03:34:32,160 --> 03:34:34,670
so that this doesn't happen
wouldn't that be like super useful but I

8330
03:34:34,670 --> 03:34:34,680
wouldn't that be like super useful but I
 

8331
03:34:34,680 --> 03:34:37,429
wouldn't that be like super useful but I
guess yeah those are against sound

8332
03:34:37,429 --> 03:34:37,439
guess yeah those are against sound
 

8333
03:34:37,439 --> 03:34:39,830
guess yeah those are against sound
and this part of the highway was in the

8334
03:34:39,830 --> 03:34:39,840
and this part of the highway was in the
 

8335
03:34:39,840 --> 03:34:41,269
and this part of the highway was in the
middle of nowhere with no houses

8336
03:34:41,269 --> 03:34:41,279
middle of nowhere with no houses
 

8337
03:34:41,279 --> 03:34:45,050
middle of nowhere with no houses
anywhere inside so you don't need the

8338
03:34:45,050 --> 03:34:45,060
anywhere inside so you don't need the
 

8339
03:34:45,060 --> 03:34:47,870
anywhere inside so you don't need the
isolation from the sound

8340
03:34:47,870 --> 03:34:47,880
isolation from the sound
 

8341
03:34:47,880 --> 03:34:50,809
isolation from the sound
the noises you don't need it

8342
03:34:50,809 --> 03:34:50,819
the noises you don't need it
 

8343
03:34:50,819 --> 03:34:53,889
the noises you don't need it
um

8344
03:34:53,889 --> 03:34:53,899

 

8345
03:34:53,899 --> 03:34:56,389

but I mean you don't have to even put up

8346
03:34:56,389 --> 03:34:56,399
but I mean you don't have to even put up
 

8347
03:34:56,399 --> 03:34:59,330
but I mean you don't have to even put up
a wall you could just put up like a a

8348
03:34:59,330 --> 03:34:59,340
a wall you could just put up like a a
 

8349
03:34:59,340 --> 03:35:02,110
a wall you could just put up like a a
wire net

8350
03:35:02,110 --> 03:35:02,120
wire net
 

8351
03:35:02,120 --> 03:35:05,690
wire net
that's as tall as a wall

8352
03:35:05,690 --> 03:35:05,700
that's as tall as a wall
 

8353
03:35:05,700 --> 03:35:09,410
that's as tall as a wall
that would be much cheaper

8354
03:35:09,410 --> 03:35:09,420

 

8355
03:35:09,420 --> 03:35:14,750
