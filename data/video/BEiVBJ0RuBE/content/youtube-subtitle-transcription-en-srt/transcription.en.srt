we're gonna be a good team you know i

5028
01:55:19,589 --> 01:55:19,599

5029
01:55:19,599 --> 01:55:20,709
we're gonna be a good team you know i
think we're gonna

5030
01:55:20,709 --> 01:55:20,719
think we're gonna
 

5031
01:55:20,719 --> 01:55:24,629
think we're gonna
be a fun time but the sad thing is cc is

5032
01:55:24,629 --> 01:55:24,639
be a fun time but the sad thing is cc is
 

5033
01:55:24,639 --> 01:55:25,669
be a fun time but the sad thing is cc is
ending

5034
01:55:25,669 --> 01:55:25,679
ending
 

5035
01:55:25,679 --> 01:55:27,990
ending
so it's kind of too late to stream cc

5036
01:55:27,990 --> 01:55:28,000
so it's kind of too late to stream cc
 

5037
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:29,430
so it's kind of too late to stream cc
now

01:55:29,430 --> 01:55:29,440
now
 

5039
01:55:29,440 --> 01:55:31,189

our accounts aren't really ready for
that anyway i think

5042
01:55:33,109 --> 01:55:33,119
that anyway i think
 

5043
01:55:33,119 --> 01:55:35,109
