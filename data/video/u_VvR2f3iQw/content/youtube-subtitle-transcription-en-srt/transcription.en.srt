5541
02:15:31,239 --> 02:15:32,069
nerd hat then I would hold on to that if
I were

5542
02:15:32,069 --> 02:15:32,079
I were
 

5543
02:15:32,079 --> 02:15:34,910
I were
you okay um and give it to how many

5544
02:15:34,910 --> 02:15:34,920
you okay um and give it to how many
 

5545
02:15:34,920 --> 02:15:38,350
you okay um and give it to how many
parts do you have by chance uh just two

5546
02:15:38,350 --> 02:15:38,360
parts do you have by chance uh just two
 

5547
02:15:38,360 --> 02:15:40,750
parts do you have by chance uh just two
okay um biu has four I wonder if she's

5548
02:15:40,750 --> 02:15:40,760
okay um biu has four I wonder if she's

using them first close the door because

5550
02:15:43,310 --> 02:15:43,320
using them first close the door because
 

5551
02:15:43,320 --> 02:15:45,109
using them first close the door because
if you use those you can make armor kits

5552
02:15:45,109 --> 02:15:45,119
if you use those you can make armor kits
 

5553
02:15:45,119 --> 02:15:48,189
if you use those you can make armor kits
if you have sewing and duct tape as well

5554
02:15:48,189 --> 02:15:48,199
if you have sewing and duct tape as well
 

5555
02:15:48,199 --> 02:15:49,510
if you have sewing and duct tape as well
and you want to make those because you

5556
02:15:49,510 --> 02:15:49,520
and you want to make those because you
 

5557
02:15:49,520 --> 02:15:51,669
and you want to make those because you
can get stronger like pieces of armor

5558
02:15:51,669 --> 02:15:51,679
can get stronger like pieces of armor
 

5559
02:15:51,679 --> 02:15:54,830
can get stronger like pieces of armor
and clothing so if you can try and use

5560
02:15:54,830 --> 02:15:54,840
and clothing so if you can try and use
 

5561
02:15:54,840 --> 02:15:57,229
and clothing so if you can try and use
those armor parts with sewing and duct

5562
02:15:57,229 --> 02:15:57,239
those armor parts with sewing and duct
 

5563
02:15:57,239 --> 02:15:59,270
those armor parts with sewing and duct
tape and put them together you can make

5564
02:15:59,270 --> 02:15:59,280
tape and put them together you can make
 

5565
02:15:59,280 --> 02:16:01,109
tape and put them together you can make
armor kits try and make some of those if

5566
02:16:01,109 --> 02:16:01,119
armor kits try and make some of those if
 

5567
02:16:01,119 --> 02:16:06,030
armor kits try and make some of those if
you can okay I think

5568
02:16:06,030 --> 02:16:06,040

 

5569
02:16:06,040 --> 02:16:09,189

armorie what what is armored up is that

5570
02:16:09,189 --> 02:16:09,199
armorie what what is armored up is that
 

5571
02:16:09,199 --> 02:16:10,669
armorie what what is armored up is that
is should we use that or should we use

5572
02:16:10,669 --> 02:16:10,679
is should we use that or should we use
 

5573
02:16:10,679 --> 02:16:13,390
is should we use that or should we use
that or should we give that to um it

5574
02:16:13,390 --> 02:16:13,400
that or should we give that to um it
 

5575
02:16:13,400 --> 02:16:15,549
that or should we give that to um it
will basically make you able to make

5576
02:16:15,549 --> 02:16:15,559
will basically make you able to make
 

5577
02:16:15,559 --> 02:16:18,109
will basically make you able to make
better level armor but the thing is we

5578
02:16:18,109 --> 02:16:18,119
better level armor but the thing is we
 

5579
02:16:18,119 --> 02:16:20,229
better level armor but the thing is we
can probably like me or Kiara have been

5580
02:16:20,229 --> 02:16:20,239
can probably like me or Kiara have been
 

5581
02:16:20,239 --> 02:16:21,549
can probably like me or Kiara have been
reading a lot of those we can just make

5582
02:16:21,549 --> 02:16:21,559
reading a lot of those we can just make
 

5583
02:16:21,559 --> 02:16:23,510
reading a lot of those we can just make
you really strong armor instead okay I

5584

7705
03:05:13,439 --> 03:05:16,389
that Callie gave me what I will say
though is that if if you are using clubs

7706
03:05:16,389 --> 03:05:16,399
though is that if if you are using clubs
 

7707
03:05:16,399 --> 03:05:17,950
though is that if if you are using clubs
and you want to level both your your

7708
03:05:17,950 --> 03:05:17,960
and you want to level both your your
 

7709
03:05:17,960 --> 03:05:19,790
and you want to level both your your
shotgun and Club strength at the same

7710
03:05:19,790 --> 03:05:19,800
shotgun and Club strength at the same
 

7711
03:05:19,800 --> 03:05:22,030
shotgun and Club strength at the same
time like they shotguns and clubs use

7712
03:05:22,030 --> 03:05:22,040
time like they shotguns and clubs use
 

7713
03:05:22,040 --> 03:05:24,670
time like they shotguns and clubs use
the same strength metric so if you

7714
03:05:24,670 --> 03:05:24,680
the same strength metric so if you
 

7715
03:05:24,680 --> 03:05:26,910
the same strength metric so if you
wanted to use shotgun might be a good

7716
03:05:26,910 --> 03:05:26,920
wanted to use shotgun might be a good
 

7717
03:05:26,920 --> 03:05:29,269
wanted to use shotgun might be a good
idea cuz you could minmax it a little

7718
03:05:29,269 --> 03:05:29,279
idea cuz you could minmax it a little
 

7719
03:05:29,279 --> 03:05:31,670
idea cuz you could minmax it a little
better but it's up to you okay I'll I'll
