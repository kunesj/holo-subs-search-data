Did you study and create it all by yourself? And what do you think

644
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:44,260
Did you study and create it all by yourself? And what do you think
 

645
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:49,860
Did you study and create it all by yourself? And what do you think
about the current one? Well, first of all, let's talk about the cherry blossoms that were created. Well, that's

646
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:49,870

 

647
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:51,710

it.  I've

648
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:51,720
it.  I've
 

649
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,909
it.  I've
always really loved making things,

650
00:25:55,909 --> 00:25:55,919
always really loved making things,
 

651
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:58,109
always really loved making things,
so

652
00:25:58,109 --> 00:25:58,119
so
 

653
00:25:58,119 --> 00:26:01,070
so
at the time of the illustration, I

654
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:01,080
at the time of the illustration, I
 

655
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:06,360
at the time of the illustration, I
was just drinking and drinking,

656
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:06,370
was just drinking and drinking,
 

657
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:07,160
was just drinking and drinking,
so I studied

658
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:07,170
so I studied
 

659
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,740
so I studied
live 2d and

660
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,730

661
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:10,740

 

662
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:16,700

somehow made it as much as I could, but

663
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:16,710
somehow made it as much as I could, but
 

664
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:21,139
somehow made it as much as I could, but
that's not how I made it.  At that time, that

665
00:26:21,139 --> 00:26:21,149
that's not how I made it.  At that time, that
 

666
00:26:21,149 --> 00:26:26,239
that's not how I made it.  At that time, that
