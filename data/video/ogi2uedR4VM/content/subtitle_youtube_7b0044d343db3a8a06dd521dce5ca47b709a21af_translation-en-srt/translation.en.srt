worried about how I can use it properly and if people will accept me, and this is it.
 

561
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:58,690

 

562
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:02,169

 

563
00:21:02,169 --> 00:21:02,179

 

564
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:06,039

I thought that with this talk, I could use my favorite skills and my wife's skills to put out good content that would appeal to everyone.

565
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:06,049
I thought that with this talk, I could use my favorite skills and my wife's skills to put out good content that would appeal to everyone.

Well, when it comes to chatting projects, for example, if you have a kid like me who can speak Japanese, I

567

Well, when it comes to chatting projects, for example, if you have a kid like me who can speak Japanese, I
 

568
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:14,139
Well, when it comes to chatting projects, for example, if you have a kid like me who can speak Japanese, I
think you can do as many chatty projects as you like with other people who can speak Japanese,

569
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:14,149
think you can do as many chatty projects as you like with other people who can speak Japanese,
 

570
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:20,590
think you can do as many chatty projects as you like with other people who can speak Japanese,
but people like Kirara-chan who can handle both Japanese and English really do.  That's because it's precious

00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,159
but people like Kirara-chan who can handle both Japanese and English really do.  That's because it's precious
As I said,

573
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:22,169
As I said,
 

574
00:21:22,169 --> 00:21:26,599
As I said,
there is no project that only Kira-chan can do. I thought that follow talk

575
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:26,609
there is no project that only Kira-chan can do. I thought that follow talk
 

576
00:21:26,609 --> 00:21:31,009
there is no project that only Kira-chan can do. I thought that follow talk
was about doing a project with Enduranma-chan that would make use of her strengths and special skills.  If

577
00:21:31,009 --> 00:21:31,019
was about doing a project with Enduranma-chan that would make use of her strengths and special skills.  If
 

578
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:37,999
was about doing a project with Enduranma-chan that would make use of her strengths and special skills.  If
you're a good girl, I think you can rest assured that Reiner is fine.In

Japan, the time when we often do something is in the morning, right?The

00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:42,190
Japan, the time when we often do something is in the morning, right?The

00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:50,700
Japan, the time when we often do something is in the morning, right?The
most recent small talk is Charlie.  What about Oto and Aso?  I

583
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:50,710
most recent small talk is Charlie.  What about Oto and Aso?  I
 

584
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:55,529
most recent small talk is Charlie.  What about Oto and Aso?  I
wonder if it was Garmin Sui-chan's episode. I wonder if Mizu-chan's care has changed.

585
00:21:55,529 --> 00:21:55,539
wonder if it was Garmin Sui-chan's episode. I wonder if Mizu-chan's care has changed.

wonder if it was Garmin Sui-chan's episode. I wonder if Mizu-chan's care has changed.
Well, I guess you're wrong. The time is right. From now on, it's already that night.

587
00:22:02,169 --> 00:22:02,179
Well, I guess you're wrong. The time is right. From now on, it's already that night.
 

588
00:22:02,179 --> 00:22:07,790
Well, I guess you're wrong. The time is right. From now on, it's already that night.
Just like 11 o'clock, it's 1 o'clock at the end of the day.  So, that Una

589
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:07,800
Just like 11 o'clock, it's 1 o'clock at the end of the day.  So, that Una
 

590
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:13,910
Just like 11 o'clock, it's 1 o'clock at the end of the day.  So, that Una
is a guest. All the guests are so sleepy that it looks like Sui-chan was pretty sleepy. Some

591
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:13,920
is a guest. All the guests are so sleepy that it looks like Sui-chan was pretty sleepy. Some

kids don't like mornings.  I do

America, Canada, etc., so I wonder who has the hot springs there in Japan.

597
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:27,820
America, Canada, etc., so I wonder who has the hot springs there in Japan.
 

598
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:32,640
America, Canada, etc., so I wonder who has the hot springs there in Japan.
Yeah, that's right, I did

599
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:32,650
Yeah, that's right, I did
 

600
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:36,360
Yeah, that's right, I did
n't like it,

601
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:36,370
n't like it,
 

602
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:38,320
n't like it,
so I bought it. That's

603
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:38,330
so I bought it. That's
 

604
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:43,930
so I bought it. That's
right. That morning, I often have the day and night reversed, so that's what it says on

605
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:43,940
right. That morning, I often have the day and night reversed, so that's what it says on

00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,490
right. That morning, I often have the day and night reversed, so that's what it says on
youtube. Who is this?  I was

607
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:45,500
youtube. Who is this?  I was
 

608
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,870
youtube. Who is this?  I was
still awake early in the morning and I was wondering if it was only the Chubu area that was having fun, and I went to Tokyo at the time and

609
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:49,880
still awake early in the morning and I was wondering if it was only the Chubu area that was having fun, and I went to Tokyo at the time and

still awake early in the morning and I was wondering if it was only the Chubu area that was having fun, and I went to Tokyo at the time and
thought Asui-chan would be great, so I watched it, and I was thinking about the drinking and automatic shops and the drawbacks,

611
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:54,830
thought Asui-chan would be great, so I watched it, and I was thinking about the drinking and automatic shops and the drawbacks,

614
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,310

and Sui-chan.  I don't think he looks sleepy at the store.I

615
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:58,320
and Sui-chan.  I don't think he looks sleepy at the store.I
 

616
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:04,999
and Sui-chan.  I don't think he looks sleepy at the store.I
think it's only a senior adobaya who says it's a slippery ride.I think it's good right now.Hmm,

617
00:23:04,999 --> 00:23:05,009
think it's only a senior adobaya who says it's a slippery ride.I think it's good right now.Hmm,

620
00:23:06,429 --> 00:23:11,430

no, it's really wonderful.It's still quite an interview project like that.

621
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:11,440
no, it's really wonderful.It's still quite an interview project like that.

no, it's really wonderful.It's still quite an interview project like that.

623

624
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:18,869

Um, I don't know why, it's hard to prepare, and even if you're playing two innings against your opponent, you have to study to some extent.So,

625
00:23:18,869 --> 00:23:20,399
Um, I don't know why, it's hard to prepare, and even if you're playing two innings against your opponent, you have to study to some extent.So,
 

626
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:20,409

 

627
00:23:20,409 --> 00:23:26,440

that's why it's so hard to do all kinds of things with three-yen fingers.Akiyama, wow, he's

628
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:26,450
that's why it's so hard to do all kinds of things with three-yen fingers.Akiyama, wow, he's
 

629
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:31,660
that's why it's so hard to do all kinds of things with three-yen fingers.Akiyama, wow, he's
fluent in all Japanese, English, and German.That's

630
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:31,670
fluent in all Japanese, English, and German.That's
 

631
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:37,360
fluent in all Japanese, English, and German.That's
right.  But I can really do Khyber Harbor, but this is the real thing.The person who

632
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:37,370
right.  But I can really do Khyber Harbor, but this is the real thing.The person who
 

633
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:41,320
right.  But I can really do Khyber Harbor, but this is the real thing.The person who
does the translation on the spot is a person who does it as a job.Wow, it's

634
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:41,330
does the translation on the spot is a person who does it as a job.Wow, it's
 

635
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:46,430
does the translation on the spot is a person who does it as a job.Wow, it's
amazing.I shouldn't say that he's so talented in the scene where he's studying.

636
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:46,440
amazing.I shouldn't say that he's so talented in the scene where he's studying.
 

637
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,610
amazing.I shouldn't say that he's so talented in the scene where he's studying.
Yes, I don't really have that kind of talent, so it's

638
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:50,620
Yes, I don't really have that kind of talent, so it's
 

639
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:57,450
Yes, I don't really have that kind of talent, so it's
quite difficult to convey all the details in

640
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:57,460
quite difficult to convey all the details in
 

641
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:00,810
quite difficult to convey all the details in
detail.Yes, it's a tomb's

642
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:00,820
detail.Yes, it's a tomb's
 

643
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:07,230

messenger.Hmm, it's quite difficult to convey it correctly because there's a lot of pressure on it.  It's not just a matter of fact, but it's

644
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:07,240
messenger.Hmm, it's quite difficult to convey it correctly because there's a lot of pressure on it.  It's not just a matter of fact, but it's
 

645
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,630
messenger.Hmm, it's quite difficult to convey it correctly because there's a lot of pressure on it.  It's not just a matter of fact, but it's
also bad for the other person at the door,

646
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:10,640
also bad for the other person at the door,
 

647
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:16,120
also bad for the other person at the door,
so it's a technique of summarizing it, shortening it, and translating it, so it's probably a

648
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:16,130
so it's a technique of summarizing it, shortening it, and translating it, so it's probably a
 

649
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:18,850
so it's a technique of summarizing it, shortening it, and translating it, so it's probably a
good idea to shake it all at the same time and then say something really difficult.

650
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:18,860
good idea to shake it all at the same time and then say something really difficult.
 

651
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:25,800
good idea to shake it all at the same time and then say something really difficult.
That's why I'm taking those notes and protecting them as I write them down, but yeah, I think it's

652
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:29,100
That's why I'm taking those notes and protecting them as I write them down, but yeah, I think it's

654
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:33,810

really nice to see Lee changing the angle of Turnip, and the camera changing his clothes.It's like a close-up or a life story.I

655
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:33,820
really nice to see Lee changing the angle of Turnip, and the camera changing his clothes.It's like a close-up or a life story.I

really nice to see Lee changing the angle of Turnip, and the camera changing his clothes.It's like a close-up or a life story.I
think it's like a good program.  I thought, Well, now I want to give something to the fishing pond.It's

657
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:40,440
think it's like a good program.  I thought, Well, now I want to give something to the fishing pond.It's
 

658
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:44,750
think it's like a good program.  I thought, Well, now I want to give something to the fishing pond.It's
hard, but somehow the horse

659
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:44,760
hard, but somehow the horse
 

660
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:50,270
hard, but somehow the horse
is doing well.  I

661
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:50,280
is doing well.  I
 

662
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:55,700
is doing well.  I
thought it was Reiner, and I thought he was serious about his activities, and now I was happy for him.It's so

663
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,720
thought it was Reiner, and I thought he was serious about his activities, and now I was happy for him.It's so
 

664
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:57,730

 

665
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:01,180

naughty, I deleted it a little, but I

666
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:01,190
naughty, I deleted it a little, but I
 

667
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:05,930
naughty, I deleted it a little, but I
was the one who started the discussion and project, and I was originally involved in that

668
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:05,940
was the one who started the discussion and project, and I was originally involved in that
 

669
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:09,889
was the one who started the discussion and project, and I was originally involved in that
game.  Well, you

670
00:25:09,889 --> 00:25:09,899
game.  Well, you
 

671
00:25:09,899 --> 00:25:14,060
game.  Well, you
might think that it's a normal game return, but I'm actually a little sick and

672
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:14,070
might think that it's a normal game return, but I'm actually a little sick and
 

673
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:16,080
might think that it's a normal game return, but I'm actually a little sick and
can't play games, so I'm

674
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:16,090
can't play games, so I'm
 

675
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:19,350
can't play games, so I'm
going to go to AFAN.

676
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:19,360
going to go to AFAN.
 

677
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,600
going to go to AFAN.
After watching the hour-long live video of my game, I thought, ``Oh, I'm probably a sick person who can't

678

After watching the hour-long live video of my game, I thought, ``Oh, I'm probably a sick person who can't

00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:29,730
After watching the hour-long live video of my game, I thought, ``Oh, I'm probably a sick person who can't
play games.'' I can't do it at the same level, but you're a lot of crap, but you lie, too.

680
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:29,740
play games.'' I can't do it at the same level, but you're a lot of crap, but you lie, too.

00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:35,700
play games.'' I can't do it at the same level, but you're a lot of crap, but you lie, too.
Ah, that's right, I wish I wasn't bad at it, but I can't do it,

682
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:35,710
Ah, that's right, I wish I wasn't bad at it, but I can't do it,
 

683
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:36,070
Ah, that's right, I wish I wasn't bad at it, but I can't do it,
but

684
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:36,080
but
 

685
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,350
but
since I can't do it, it's only a long way away,

686
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:39,360
since I can't do it, it's only a long way away,
 

687
