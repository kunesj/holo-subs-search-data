what's important is how it appears for
 

1567
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,150
what's important is how it appears for
kiara i guess so that's why it's

1568
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:16,160
kiara i guess so that's why it's
 

1569
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,510
kiara i guess so that's why it's
important that we follow along to the

1570
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:17,520
important that we follow along to the
 

1571
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,510
important that we follow along to the
music with the moves because even though

1572
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:19,520
music with the moves because even though
 

1573
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,589
music with the moves because even though
you look out of sync for everybody else

1574

you look out of sync for everybody else
 

1575
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:25,030
you look out of sync for everybody else
it should hopefully be in sync for kiara
