to sell because it's relatively

972
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:35,480
to sell because it's relatively
 

973
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,789
to sell because it's relatively
expensive and big

974
00:24:37,789 --> 00:24:37,799
expensive and big
 

975
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:41,430
expensive and big
and not everybody wants to buy a new

976
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:41,440
and not everybody wants to buy a new
 

977
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,830
and not everybody wants to buy a new
case so I'm not very confident in it's

978
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:45,840
case so I'm not very confident in it's
 

979
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,870
case so I'm not very confident in it's
selling so well but it's not really my

980
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:47,880
selling so well but it's not really my
 

981
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,190
selling so well but it's not really my
decision if they think that I should do

982
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:50,200
decision if they think that I should do
 

983
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,630
decision if they think that I should do
one and they think it would sell well

984
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:52,640
one and they think it would sell well
 

985
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,870
one and they think it would sell well
then they would they would probably hit

986
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:53,880
then they would they would probably hit
 

987
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,510
then they would they would probably hit

me up I guess that makes sense I don't
 

989
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,870
me up I guess that makes sense I don't
know when it comes to whether it sells

990
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:57,880
know when it comes to whether it sells
 

991
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,549
know when it comes to whether it sells
or not I don't care about that I'm just

ladders if we make them normal stairs

4630
01:52:47,430 --> 01:52:47,440
ladders if we make them normal stairs
 

4631
01:52:47,440 --> 01:52:50,310
ladders if we make them normal stairs
they might go to the beds on their own

4632

really long but the creation part really
 

5329
02:09:24,880 --> 02:09:28,030
really long but the creation part really
actually isn't long at all okay I think

5330
02:09:28,030 --> 02:09:28,040
actually isn't long at all okay I think
 

5331
02:09:28,040 --> 02:09:30,350

5335
02:09:32,920 --> 02:09:35,510
but uh where do you want to do it up
there I wonder what would be best I

5336
02:09:35,510 --> 02:09:35,520
there I wonder what would be best I
 

5337
02:09:35,520 --> 02:09:37,390
there I wonder what would be best I
guess that would be so

5338
02:09:37,390 --> 02:09:37,400
guess that would be so
 

5339
02:09:37,400 --> 02:09:40,229
guess that would be so
close no he he can't climb the stairs

5340
02:09:40,229 --> 02:09:40,239
close no he he can't climb the stairs
 

5341
02:09:40,239 --> 02:09:43,030
close no he he can't climb the stairs
but if we spawn him up here I

5342
02:09:43,030 --> 02:09:43,040
but if we spawn him up here I
 

5343
02:09:43,040 --> 02:09:45,790
but if we spawn him up here I
guess I guess that could

5344
02:09:45,790 --> 02:09:45,800
guess I guess that could
 

5345
02:09:45,800 --> 02:09:48,310
guess I guess that could
work if we got rid of the Torches I feel

5346
02:09:48,310 --> 02:09:48,320
work if we got rid of the Torches I feel

to
spawn on those areas oh that's the job

5668
02:17:55,629 --> 02:17:55,639
spawn on those areas oh that's the job
 

5669

only these these blocks on the side look

5680
02:18:15,469 --> 02:18:15,479
only these these blocks on the side look
 

5681
02:18:15,479 --> 02:18:17,870

5683
02:18:17,880 --> 02:18:19,629
til yep yep that's there it's only those
that are supposed to be tiled oh okay

5684
02:18:19,629 --> 02:18:19,639
that are supposed to be tiled oh okay
 

5685
02:18:19,639 --> 02:18:21,990

then all is good in this tutorial but

5686
02:18:21,990 --> 02:18:22,000
then all is good in this tutorial but
 

5687
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:23,469
then all is good in this tutorial but
I'll double check and make sure it's not

5688
02:18:23,469 --> 02:18:23,479
I'll double check and make sure it's not
 

5689
02:18:23,479 --> 02:18:26,190
I'll double check and make sure it's not
like a double that I missed but I don't

5690
02:18:26,190 --> 02:18:26,200
like a double that I missed but I don't
 

5691
02:18:26,200 --> 02:18:27,509
like a double that I missed but I don't
think

5692
02:18:27,509 --> 02:18:27,519
think
 

5693
02:18:27,519 --> 02:18:30,790
think
so ke you being able to build this kind

5694
02:18:30,790 --> 02:18:30,800
so ke you being able to build this kind
 

5695
02:18:30,800 --> 02:18:33,830
so ke you being able to build this kind
of inspires me to also build something

5696
02:18:33,830 --> 02:18:33,840
of inspires me to also build something
 

5697
02:18:33,840 --> 02:18:35,150
of inspires me to also build something
like this

5698
02:18:35,150 --> 02:18:35,160
like this
 

5699
02:18:35,160 --> 02:18:37,950
like this
sometime ah why I just follow I'm just

5700
02:18:37,950 --> 02:18:37,960
sometime ah why I just follow I'm just
 

5701
02:18:37,960 --> 02:18:40,629
sometime ah why I just follow I'm just
following the tutorial but I wanted to

try and do something where's the lava

5704
02:18:42,870 --> 02:18:42,880
try and do something where's the lava
 

5705
02:18:42,880 --> 02:18:45,589
try and do something where's the lava
this is a non- lava build it's slower

5706
02:18:45,589 --> 02:18:45,599
this is a non- lava build it's slower
 

5707
02:18:45,599 --> 02:18:47,030
this is a non- lava build it's slower
though I think with the iron but that's

5708
02:18:47,030 --> 02:18:47,040
though I think with the iron but that's
 

5709
02:18:47,040 --> 02:18:49,309
though I think with the iron but that's
okay I don't

5710
02:18:49,309 --> 02:18:49,319
okay I don't
 

5711
02:18:49,319 --> 02:18:52,509
okay I don't
care I just want wanted it to work we

5712
02:18:52,509 --> 02:18:52,519
care I just want wanted it to work we
 

5713
02:18:52,519 --> 02:18:55,150
care I just want wanted it to work we
don't need like endless amounts of it

5714
02:18:55,150 --> 02:18:55,160
don't need like endless amounts of it
 

5715
02:18:55,160 --> 02:18:58,190

mean so we should turn the spawn proof

5758
02:19:56,349 --> 02:19:56,359
mean so we should turn the spawn proof
 

5759
02:19:56,359 --> 02:19:58,190
mean so we should turn the spawn proof
already true like in that direction it

5760
02:19:58,190 --> 02:19:58,200
already true like in that direction it
 

5761
02:19:58,200 --> 02:20:00,870
already true like in that direction it
should be okay where there's only

5762

follow tutorial first and then fix yeah
we'll just make it work once and then

5772
02:20:18,309 --> 02:20:18,319
we'll just make it work once and then
 

5773
02:20:18,319 --> 02:20:19,950
we'll just make it work once and then
we'll see if the Golem spawning

5774
02:20:19,950 --> 02:20:19,960
we'll see if the Golem spawning
 

5775
02:20:19,960 --> 02:20:22,630
we'll see if the Golem spawning
elsewhere is is a problem for real so

5776
02:20:22,630 --> 02:20:22,640
elsewhere is is a problem for real so
 

5777
02:20:22,640 --> 02:20:25,110
elsewhere is is a problem for real so
Kelly you understood what they're saying

Kelly you understood what they're saying
 

5779
02:20:25,120 --> 02:20:27,150
Kelly you understood what they're saying
y i get it that they might just spawn

5780
02:20:27,150 --> 02:20:27,160
y i get it that they might just spawn
 

5781
02:20:27,160 --> 02:20:30,070
y i get it that they might just spawn
nearby instead of inside of here here

5782
02:20:30,070 --> 02:20:30,080
nearby instead of inside of here here
 

5783
02:20:30,080 --> 02:20:32,230
nearby instead of inside of here here
which is not what we want

5784
02:20:32,230 --> 02:20:32,240
which is not what we want
 

5785
02:20:32,240 --> 02:20:34,790
which is not what we want
yeah make sure they can't spawn on the

5786
02:20:34,790 --> 02:20:34,800
yeah make sure they can't spawn on the
 

5787
02:20:34,800 --> 02:20:37,349

5789
02:20:37,359 --> 02:20:39,750

it you need to make everywhere around

5790
02:20:39,750 --> 02:20:39,760
it you need to make everywhere around
 

5791
02:20:39,760 --> 02:20:41,950
it you need to make everywhere around
not a place things are able to spawn

5792
02:20:41,950 --> 02:20:41,960
not a place things are able to spawn
 

5793
02:20:41,960 --> 02:20:44,070
not a place things are able to spawn
okay but like how far out when you say

there's a chance that the trapo is a

6560
02:38:25,469 --> 02:38:25,479
there's a chance that the trapo is a
 

6561
02:38:25,479 --> 02:38:27,670
there's a chance that the trapo is a
little bit too high like one half of a

6562
02:38:27,670 --> 02:38:27,680
little bit too high like one half of a
 

6563
02:38:27,680 --> 02:38:31,230

so
 

6567
02:38:34,080 --> 02:38:37,269
so
maybe maybe

6568
02:38:37,269 --> 02:38:37,279

6569
02:38:37,279 --> 02:38:53,150
maybe maybe
maybe I was very careful

shenanigans well if he does still exist

8610
03:30:41,429 --> 03:30:41,439
shenanigans well if he does still exist
 

8611
03:30:41,439 --> 03:30:42,990

though do you think that interferes with

8612
03:30:42,990 --> 03:30:43,000
though do you think that interferes with
 

8613
03:30:43,000 --> 03:30:46,389
though do you think that interferes with
it no

8614
03:30:46,389 --> 03:30:46,399
it no
 

8615
03:30:46,399 --> 03:30:54,309
it no
I don't think so one spawned below

8616
03:30:54,309 --> 03:30:54,319

 

8617
03:30:54,319 --> 03:30:56,910

below oh yeah the place that you buil

8618
03:30:56,910 --> 03:30:56,920
below oh yeah the place that you buil
 

8619
03:30:56,920 --> 03:30:58,469
below oh yeah the place that you buil
underneath all of this don't worry don't

8620

to spawn there cuz it's bottom slabs

8624
03:31:03,790 --> 03:31:03,800
to spawn there cuz it's bottom slabs
 

8625
03:31:03,800 --> 03:31:06,550
to spawn there cuz it's bottom slabs
they don't spawn on bottom slabs oh I

8626
03:31:06,550 --> 03:31:06,560
they don't spawn on bottom slabs oh I
 

8627
03:31:06,560 --> 03:31:09,110
they don't spawn on bottom slabs oh I
see I see

can't somebody saying Golems don't die

8636
03:31:19,389 --> 03:31:19,399
can't somebody saying Golems don't die
 

8637
03:31:19,399 --> 03:31:21,790
can't somebody saying Golems don't die
in water but if the tutorial says so it

8638
03:31:21,790 --> 03:31:21,800
in water but if the tutorial says so it
 

8639
03:31:21,800 --> 03:31:24,750
in water but if the tutorial says so it
will die in water it died in this water

8640
03:31:24,750 --> 03:31:24,760
will die in water it died in this water
 

8641
03:31:24,760 --> 03:31:25,670
will die in water it died in this water
for

8642
03:31:25,670 --> 03:31:25,680
for
 

8643

1 15.2 you're using a 1.16 yeah but we

8646
03:31:34,469 --> 03:31:34,479
1 15.2 you're using a 1.16 yeah but we
 

8647
03:31:34,479 --> 03:31:37,110
1 15.2 you're using a 1.16 yeah but we
thought that would be fine we came to

8648
03:31:37,110 --> 03:31:37,120
thought that would be fine we came to
 

8649
03:31:37,120 --> 03:31:38,830
thought that would be fine we came to
the conclusion that surely that will be

8650
03:31:38,830 --> 03:31:38,840
the conclusion that surely that will be
 

8651
03:31:38,840 --> 03:31:43,670
the conclusion that surely that will be
fine because it's just one version

8652
03:31:43,670 --> 03:31:43,680

 

8653
03:31:43,680 --> 03:31:46,070

difference they will die to to we'll

8654
03:31:46,070 --> 03:31:46,080
difference they will die to to we'll
 

8655
03:31:46,080 --> 03:31:47,830
difference they will die to to we'll
kill them one way or another even if I

8656
03:31:47,830 --> 03:31:47,840
kill them one way or another even if I
 

8657
03:31:47,840 --> 03:31:49,429
kill them one way or another even if I
have to kill them by hand with a bucket

8658
03:31:49,429 --> 03:31:49,439
have to kill them by hand with a bucket
 

8659
03:31:49,439 --> 03:31:52,349
have to kill them by hand with a bucket
of lava I will fre freaking do

of lava I will fre freaking do
 

8661
03:31:52,359 --> 03:31:54,670
of lava I will fre freaking do
it or if I have to shoot them if they

8662
03:31:54,670 --> 03:31:54,680

fall down there you know we can just
 

8665
03:31:56,840 --> 03:32:01,429

it was about the update but I think that
 

9385
03:50:44,159 --> 03:50:46,309
it was about the update but I think that
it's very important that like the job

9386
03:50:46,309 --> 03:50:46,319
it's very important that like the job
 

9387

maybe it did matter so that's the only

9392
03:50:56,590 --> 03:50:56,600
maybe it did matter so that's the only
 

9393
03:50:56,600 --> 03:50:57,630
maybe it did matter so that's the only
reason why we need to have their

03:50:57,630 --> 03:50:57,640
reason why we need to have their
 

9395
03:50:57,640 --> 03:51:00,349
reason why we need to have their

9396
03:51:00,349 --> 03:51:00,359
workstations next to them that's my
