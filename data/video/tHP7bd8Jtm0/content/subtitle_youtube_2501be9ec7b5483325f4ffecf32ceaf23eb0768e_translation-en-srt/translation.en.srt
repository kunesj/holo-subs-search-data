3735
02:00:48,360 --> 02:00:49,790
I feel like I'm going to be attacked if I find this.
I felt like

3736
02:00:49,790 --> 02:00:49,800
I felt like
 

3737
02:00:49,800 --> 02:00:53,229
I felt like
Well, I guess I'll probably have to move from here.

3738
02:00:53,229 --> 02:00:53,239
Well, I guess I'll probably have to move from here.
 

3739
02:00:53,239 --> 02:00:55,990
Well, I guess I'll probably have to move from here.
I think everyone should move then I'll go.

3740
02:00:55,990 --> 02:00:56,000
I think everyone should move then I'll go.
 

3741
02:00:56,000 --> 02:01:00,310
I think everyone should move then I'll go.
I went

3742
02:01:00,310 --> 02:01:00,320

 

3743
02:01:00,320 --> 02:01:03,390

Masu

3744
02:01:03,390 --> 02:01:03,400

 

3745
02:01:03,400 --> 02:01:06,910

Hello, Nemio

3746
02:01:06,910 --> 02:01:06,920
Hello, Nemio
 

3747
02:01:06,920 --> 02:01:11,030
Hello, Nemio
It's okay, I haven't practiced at all.

3748
02:01:11,030 --> 02:01:11,040
It's okay, I haven't practiced at all.
 

3749
02:01:11,040 --> 02:01:13,189
It's okay, I haven't practiced at all.
I haven't practiced

3750
02:01:13,189 --> 02:01:13,199
I haven't practiced
 

3751
02:01:13,199 --> 02:01:17,069
I haven't practiced
Let's do our best from now on, though.

3752
02:01:17,069 --> 02:01:17,079
Let's do our best from now on, though.
 

3753
02:01:17,079 --> 02:01:21,430
Let's do our best from now on, though.
I wonder what the general is like, his light is shining so brightly.

3754
02:01:21,430 --> 02:01:21,440
I wonder what the general is like, his light is shining so brightly.
 

3755
02:01:21,440 --> 02:01:23,750
I wonder what the general is like, his light is shining so brightly.
Yes, that's true, the world is shining too.

3756
02:01:23,750 --> 02:01:23,760
Yes, that's true, the world is shining too.
 

3757
02:01:23,760 --> 02:01:26,229
Yes, that's true, the world is shining too.
I wondered, what could this be?

3758
02:01:26,229 --> 02:01:26,239
I wondered, what could this be?
 

3759
02:01:26,239 --> 02:01:30,069
I wondered, what could this be?
It seems like that's what happened to that general.

3760
02:01:30,069 --> 02:01:30,079
It seems like that's what happened to that general.
 

3761
02:01:30,079 --> 02:01:34,069
It seems like that's what happened to that general.
If you are defeated, the number of kills is 1.

3762
02:01:34,069 --> 02:01:34,079
If you are defeated, the number of kills is 1.
 

3763
02:01:34,079 --> 02:01:37,669
If you are defeated, the number of kills is 1.
Yeah, that point becomes that plus.

3764
02:01:37,669 --> 02:01:37,679
Yeah, that point becomes that plus.
 

3765
02:01:37,679 --> 02:01:39,669
Yeah, that point becomes that plus.
Yes, yes, yes, from other teams.

3766
02:01:39,669 --> 02:01:39,679
Yes, yes, yes, from other teams.
 

3767
02:01:39,679 --> 02:01:43,149
Yes, yes, yes, from other teams.
Yes, that's the target.

3768
02:01:43,149 --> 02:01:43,159
Yes, that's the target.
 

3769
02:01:43,159 --> 02:01:46,229
Yes, that's the target.
For example, 3rd place at the bottom is 5 points.

3770
02:01:46,229 --> 02:01:46,239
For example, 3rd place at the bottom is 5 points.
 

3771
02:01:46,239 --> 02:01:49,310
For example, 3rd place at the bottom is 5 points.
Even if it's true, I've defeated the general three times, so it's a point.

3772
02:01:49,310 --> 02:01:49,320
Even if it's true, I've defeated the general three times, so it's a point.
 

3773
02:01:49,320 --> 02:01:51,229
Even if it's true, I've defeated the general three times, so it's a point.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, it seems like it's going to be.

3774
02:01:51,229 --> 02:01:51,239
Yes, yes, yes, yes, it seems like it's going to be.
 

3775
02:01:51,239 --> 02:01:53,990
Yes, yes, yes, yes, it seems like it's going to be.
So the general doesn't get knocked down.

3776
02:01:53,990 --> 02:01:54,000
So the general doesn't get knocked down.
 

3777
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:55,589
So the general doesn't get knocked down.
You have to be careful about that, right?

3778
02:01:55,589 --> 02:01:55,599
You have to be careful about that, right?
 

3779
02:01:55,599 --> 02:01:59,030
You have to be careful about that, right?
I understand, let's do our best to escape.

3780
02:01:59,030 --> 02:01:59,040
I understand, let's do our best to escape.
 

3781
02:01:59,040 --> 02:02:01,750
I understand, let's do our best to escape.
run away or run away

3782
02:02:01,750 --> 02:02:01,760
run away or run away
 

3783
02:02:01,760 --> 02:02:04,229
run away or run away
It's okay, it's okay, but it's okay.

3784
02:02:04,229 --> 02:02:04,239
It's okay, it's okay, but it's okay.
 

3785
02:02:04,239 --> 02:02:07,189
It's okay, it's okay, but it's okay.
We were both defeated by the same white team earlier.

3786
02:02:07,189 --> 02:02:07,199
We were both defeated by the same white team earlier.
 

3787
02:02:07,199 --> 02:02:09,550
We were both defeated by the same white team earlier.
If so, let's cover it a bit.

3788
02:02:09,550 --> 02:02:09,560
If so, let's cover it a bit.
 

3789
02:02:09,560 --> 02:02:12,470
If so, let's cover it a bit.
I was doing that, yes, yes, maybe, just in case.

3790
02:02:12,470 --> 02:02:12,480
I was doing that, yes, yes, maybe, just in case.
 

3791
02:02:12,480 --> 02:02:16,470
I was doing that, yes, yes, maybe, just in case.
I'm sure he's watching, huh?

3792
02:02:16,470 --> 02:02:16,480
I'm sure he's watching, huh?
 

3793
02:02:16,480 --> 02:02:17,950
I'm sure he's watching, huh?
Fair enough

3794
02:02:17,950 --> 02:02:17,960
Fair enough
 

3795
02:02:17,960 --> 02:02:22,270
Fair enough
Wait a minute, that's awesome

3796
02:02:22,270 --> 02:02:22,280
Wait a minute, that's awesome
 

3797
02:02:22,280 --> 02:02:25,189
Wait a minute, that's awesome
Maybe a little more on this side

3798
02:02:25,189 --> 02:02:25,199
Maybe a little more on this side
 

3799
02:02:25,199 --> 02:02:26,950
Maybe a little more on this side
Thank you so much!

3800
02:02:26,950 --> 02:02:26,960
Thank you so much!
 

3801
02:02:26,960 --> 02:02:30,030
Thank you so much!
I'm so sorry, but by the way, it's broadcast at night.

3802
02:02:30,030 --> 02:02:30,040
I'm so sorry, but by the way, it's broadcast at night.
 

3803
02:02:30,040 --> 02:02:31,870
I'm so sorry, but by the way, it's broadcast at night.
But it's okay, it's okay, it's okay

3804
02:02:31,870 --> 02:02:31,880
But it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
 

3805
02:02:31,880 --> 02:02:35,910
But it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, oh, it's like that sharp-sounding agent.

3806
02:02:35,910 --> 02:02:35,920
It's okay, oh, it's like that sharp-sounding agent.
 

3807
02:02:35,920 --> 02:02:38,149
It's okay, oh, it's like that sharp-sounding agent.
each one

3808

each one
 

3809
02:02:38,159 --> 02:02:41,910
each one
It would be nice to have it made in the studio.

3810
02:02:41,910 --> 02:02:41,920
It would be nice to have it made in the studio.
 

3811
02:02:41,920 --> 02:02:44,550
It would be nice to have it made in the studio.
Do you want to do your best or have a strategy?

3812
02:02:44,550 --> 02:02:44,560
Do you want to do your best or have a strategy?
 

3813
02:02:44,560 --> 02:02:46,350
Do you want to do your best or have a strategy?
If you tell me what you want to do, I'll move.

3814
02:02:46,350 --> 02:02:46,360
If you tell me what you want to do, I'll move.
 

3815
02:02:46,360 --> 02:02:47,950
If you tell me what you want to do, I'll move.
So

At yesterday's practice session, that general...

3820
02:02:54,390 --> 02:02:54,400
At yesterday's practice session, that general...
 

3821
02:02:54,400 --> 02:02:56,950
At yesterday's practice session, that general...
I'm scared and don't come forward much and just protect.

3822
02:02:56,950 --> 02:02:56,960
I'm scared and don't come forward much and just protect.
 

3823
02:02:56,960 --> 02:03:00,189
I'm scared and don't come forward much and just protect.
If you do that, yeah, that's normal points.

3824
02:03:00,189 --> 02:03:00,199
If you do that, yeah, that's normal points.
 

3825
02:03:00,199 --> 02:03:02,390
If you do that, yeah, that's normal points.
It was a bit low. It's not tasty.

3826
02:03:02,390 --> 02:03:02,400
It was a bit low. It's not tasty.
 

3827
02:03:02,400 --> 02:03:05,189
It was a bit low. It's not tasty.
So to earn points,

3828
02:03:05,189 --> 02:03:05,199
So to earn points,
 

3829
02:03:05,199 --> 02:03:07,629
So to earn points,
I guess I'll have to go punch the general too.

3830
02:03:07,629 --> 02:03:07,639
I guess I'll have to go punch the general too.
 

3831
02:03:07,639 --> 02:03:11,069
I guess I'll have to go punch the general too.
That's what I felt, but the general took it.

3832
02:03:11,069 --> 02:03:11,079
That's what I felt, but the general took it.
 

3833
02:03:11,079 --> 02:03:13,750
That's what I felt, but the general took it.
The points are the same as everyone else.

3834
02:03:13,750 --> 02:03:13,760
The points are the same as everyone else.
 

3835
02:03:13,760 --> 02:03:16,830
The points are the same as everyone else.
The same irrelevant feeling, when taken away

3836
02:03:16,830 --> 02:03:16,840
The same irrelevant feeling, when taken away
 

3837
02:03:16,840 --> 02:03:19,430
The same irrelevant feeling, when taken away
It's just that the points are different, yeah yeah

3838
02:03:19,430 --> 02:03:19,440
It's just that the points are different, yeah yeah
 

3839
02:03:19,440 --> 02:03:22,709
It's just that the points are different, yeah yeah
That's right hahaha I understand, I understand

3846
02:03:32,229 --> 02:03:32,239
I guess it's just a little bit of damage.
 

3847

Maybe, but yesterday there was a lot of red and yellow.
The targets are hitting each other so hard.

3856
02:03:45,990 --> 02:03:46,000
The targets are hitting each other so hard.
 

3857
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:49,229
The targets are hitting each other so hard.
I see, white is supposed to protect you from the cold.

3858
02:03:49,229 --> 02:03:49,239
I see, white is supposed to protect you from the cold.
 

3859
02:03:49,239 --> 02:03:52,830
I see, white is supposed to protect you from the cold.
That's pretty much it. Don't be too aggressive.

3860
02:03:52,830 --> 02:03:52,840
That's pretty much it. Don't be too aggressive.
 

3861
02:03:52,840 --> 02:03:56,629
That's pretty much it. Don't be too aggressive.
Yeah, if they attack from the other side, I'll switch places.

3862
02:03:56,629 --> 02:03:56,639
Yeah, if they attack from the other side, I'll switch places.
 

3863
02:03:56,639 --> 02:03:59,030
Yeah, if they attack from the other side, I'll switch places.
It was like that, but even this time

02:03:59,030 --> 02:03:59,040
It was like that, but even this time
 

3865
02:03:59,040 --> 02:04:01,790
It was like that, but even this time
The general is different this time.

3866
02:04:01,790 --> 02:04:01,800
The general is different this time.
 

3867
02:04:01,800 --> 02:04:04,950
The general is different this time.
It's different this time.

3868
02:04:04,950 --> 02:04:04,960
It's different this time.
 

3869
02:04:04,960 --> 02:04:09,390
It's different this time.
Will I be able to go there even though I might be attacked quickly?

3870
02:04:09,390 --> 02:04:09,400
Will I be able to go there even though I might be attacked quickly?
 

3871
02:04:09,400 --> 02:04:13,790

There's a possibility that someone might attack you.
 

3875

It looks like we'll be able to surpass first place in both games.

4414
02:19:22,150 --> 02:19:22,160
It looks like we'll be able to surpass first place in both games.
 

4415
02:19:22,160 --> 02:19:25,190
It looks like we'll be able to surpass first place in both games.
Even in that second round, Haku was pretty good too.

4416
02:19:25,190 --> 02:19:25,200
Even in that second round, Haku was pretty good too.

There's a chance you can turn it around, so do your best.

4422
02:19:32,669 --> 02:19:32,679
There's a chance you can turn it around, so do your best.
 

4423
02:19:32,679 --> 02:19:34,469
There's a chance you can turn it around, so do your best.
I want to do my best if I don't have one.

4424
02:19:34,469 --> 02:19:34,479
I want to do my best if I don't have one.
 

4425
02:19:34,479 --> 02:19:37,870
I want to do my best if I don't have one.
Well, I guess I do, but I have to attack to a certain extent.

4426
02:19:37,870 --> 02:19:37,880
Well, I guess I do, but I have to attack to a certain extent.
 

4427
02:19:37,880 --> 02:19:41,110
Well, I guess I do, but I have to attack to a certain extent.
I guess we can't win after all.

4428
02:19:41,110 --> 02:19:41,120
I guess we can't win after all.
 

4429
02:19:41,120 --> 02:19:44,469
I guess we can't win after all.
Is it okay if I attack? It's still not enough.

4430
02:19:44,469 --> 02:19:44,479
Is it okay if I attack? It's still not enough.
 

4431
02:19:44,479 --> 02:19:47,669
Is it okay if I attack? It's still not enough.
I don't care what happens, I guess it's what it is now.

4432
02:19:47,669 --> 02:19:47,679
I don't care what happens, I guess it's what it is now.
 

4433

I want to do it before I can get enough kills.

4434
02:19:51,030 --> 02:19:51,040
I want to do it before I can get enough kills.
 

4435

It feels like it, but I just don't push into the enemy camp too much.

4436
02:19:53,389 --> 02:19:53,399
It feels like it, but I just don't push into the enemy camp too much.
 

4437
02:19:53,399 --> 02:19:55,870
It feels like it, but I just don't push into the enemy camp too much.
If it's too much, you'll probably die, so I guess it's okay.

4438
02:19:55,870 --> 02:19:55,880
If it's too much, you'll probably die, so I guess it's okay.
 

4439
02:19:55,880 --> 02:19:58,510
If it's too much, you'll probably die, so I guess it's okay.
No, it wasn't like I was pulling it too far.

4440
02:19:58,510 --> 02:19:58,520
No, it wasn't like I was pulling it too far.
 

4441
02:19:58,520 --> 02:20:04,030
No, it wasn't like I was pulling it too far.
I think the way I feel now is totally fine.

4442
02:20:04,030 --> 02:20:04,040
I think the way I feel now is totally fine.
 

4443
02:20:04,040 --> 02:20:06,630
I think the way I feel now is totally fine.
Well, my environment is different from the normal people around me.

02:20:06,630 --> 02:20:06,640
Well, my environment is different from the normal people around me.
 

4445
02:20:06,640 --> 02:20:09,710
Well, my environment is different from the normal people around me.
I'm the general, and I'm carrying what I'm chasing after.

4446
02:20:09,710 --> 02:20:09,720
I'm the general, and I'm carrying what I'm chasing after.
 

4447
02:20:09,720 --> 02:20:14,110
I'm the general, and I'm carrying what I'm chasing after.
It's different, no, it's true, life is heavy.

4448
02:20:14,110 --> 02:20:14,120
It's different, no, it's true, life is heavy.
 

4449
02:20:14,120 --> 02:20:19,270
It's different, no, it's true, life is heavy.
It's heavy. I can't die easily. It's interrupted.

4450
02:20:19,270 --> 02:20:19,280
