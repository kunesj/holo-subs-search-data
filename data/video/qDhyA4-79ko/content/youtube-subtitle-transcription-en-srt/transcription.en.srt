3208
01:25:02,270 --> 01:25:02,280
like
 

3209
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:05,669
like
twice oh so like we we have to make a

3210
01:25:05,669 --> 01:25:05,679
twice oh so like we we have to make a
 

3211
01:25:05,679 --> 01:25:07,790
twice oh so like we we have to make a
loop and then go but I'm not actually

3212
01:25:07,790 --> 01:25:07,800
loop and then go but I'm not actually
 

3213
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:10,510
loop and then go but I'm not actually
sure loop I I mean that's my idea I'm

3214
01:25:10,510 --> 01:25:10,520
sure loop I I mean that's my idea I'm
 

3215
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:13,189
sure loop I I mean that's my idea I'm
not sure if it's that that's correct I I

3216
01:25:13,189 --> 01:25:13,199
not sure if it's that that's correct I I
 

3217
01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:14,990
not sure if it's that that's correct I I
just I just

3218
01:25:14,990 --> 01:25:15,000
just I just
 

3219
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,350
just I just
assumed maybe it has like to make I

3220
01:25:17,350 --> 01:25:17,360
assumed maybe it has like to make I
 

3221
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:19,629
assumed maybe it has like to make I
think I this down

3222
01:25:19,629 --> 01:25:19,639
think I this down
 

3223
01:25:19,639 --> 01:25:22,750
think I this down
now it has to go double time on the cold

my RPG senses were T tingling yeah but
 

5419
02:23:02,560 --> 02:23:04,190
my RPG senses were T tingling yeah but
how do you jump from

5420
02:23:04,190 --> 02:23:04,200
how do you jump from
 

5421
02:23:04,200 --> 02:23:06,710
how do you jump from
here well we got to find a way it must

5422
02:23:06,710 --> 02:23:06,720
here well we got to find a way it must
 

5423
02:23:06,720 --> 02:23:08,710
here well we got to find a way it must
be possible otherwise I don't think the

5424
02:23:08,710 --> 02:23:08,720
be possible otherwise I don't think the
 

5425
02:23:08,720 --> 02:23:12,270
be possible otherwise I don't think the
tree would like really grow this big do

5426
02:23:12,270 --> 02:23:12,280
tree would like really grow this big do
 

5427
02:23:12,280 --> 02:23:13,990
tree would like really grow this big do
you remember you made you cooked

5428
02:23:13,990 --> 02:23:14,000
you remember you made you cooked
 

5429
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,389
you remember you made you cooked
something to make the J the jump higher

5430
02:23:16,389 --> 02:23:16,399
something to make the J the jump higher
 

5431
02:23:16,399 --> 02:23:18,349
something to make the J the jump higher
can you make can you can you give one to

5432
02:23:18,349 --> 02:23:18,359
can you make can you can you give one to
 

5433
02:23:18,359 --> 02:23:20,230
can you make can you can you give one to
me as well I want to try if you have

5434
02:23:20,230 --> 02:23:20,240
me as well I want to try if you have
 

5435
02:23:20,240 --> 02:23:21,030
me as well I want to try if you have
more

5436
02:23:21,030 --> 02:23:21,040
more
 

5437
02:23:21,040 --> 02:23:23,550
more
I would need I already ate the first one

5438
02:23:23,550 --> 02:23:23,560
I would need I already ate the first one
 

5439
02:23:23,560 --> 02:23:25,389
I would need I already ate the first one
and I don't have anym I would need more

5440
02:23:25,389 --> 02:23:25,399
and I don't have anym I would need more
 

5441
02:23:25,399 --> 02:23:26,710
and I don't have anym I would need more
ingredients but I think we should be

5442
02:23:26,710 --> 02:23:26,720
ingredients but I think we should be
 

5443
02:23:26,720 --> 02:23:28,110
ingredients but I think we should be
able to do it without because honestly

5444
02:23:28,110 --> 02:23:28,120
able to do it without because honestly
 

5445
02:23:28,120 --> 02:23:30,750
able to do it without because honestly
the jump it didn't get much bigger it

5446
02:23:30,750 --> 02:23:30,760
the jump it didn't get much bigger it
 

5447
02:23:30,760 --> 02:23:34,990
the jump it didn't get much bigger it
was just like like 5 cm I don't know if

5448
02:23:34,990 --> 02:23:35,000
was just like like 5 cm I don't know if
 

5449
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:37,150
was just like like 5 cm I don't know if
it's possible

5450
02:23:37,150 --> 02:23:37,160
it's possible
 

5451
02:23:37,160 --> 02:23:40,910
it's possible
from there yeah um there must be a

5452
02:23:40,910 --> 02:23:40,920
from there yeah um there must be a
 

5453
02:23:40,920 --> 02:23:43,750
from there yeah um there must be a
different path I guess a different path

5454
02:23:43,750 --> 02:23:43,760
different path I guess a different path
 

5455
02:23:43,760 --> 02:23:47,950
different path I guess a different path
yeah from the first

5456
02:23:47,950 --> 02:23:47,960

 

5457
02:23:47,960 --> 02:23:51,150

side definitely not it

5458
02:23:51,150 --> 02:23:51,160
side definitely not it
 

5459
02:23:51,160 --> 02:23:54,870
side definitely not it
or I wonder if it can grow if this is

5460
02:23:54,870 --> 02:23:54,880
or I wonder if it can grow if this is
 

5461
02:23:54,880 --> 02:23:59,750
or I wonder if it can grow if this is
the last stage of the tree

5462
02:23:59,750 --> 02:23:59,760

 

5463
02:23:59,760 --> 02:24:02,870

Grove honestly I'm not even like 100%

5464
02:24:02,870 --> 02:24:02,880
Grove honestly I'm not even like 100%
 

5465
02:24:02,880 --> 02:24:05,389
Grove honestly I'm not even like 100%
sure about any of this of course

5466
02:24:05,389 --> 02:24:05,399
sure about any of this of course
 

5467
02:24:05,399 --> 02:24:08,150
sure about any of this of course
but I just had a feeling you

5468
02:24:08,150 --> 02:24:08,160
but I just had a feeling you
 

5469
02:24:08,160 --> 02:24:11,070
but I just had a feeling you
know yeah I mean we we here to explore

5470
02:24:11,070 --> 02:24:11,080
know yeah I mean we we here to explore
 

5471
02:24:11,080 --> 02:24:14,950
know yeah I mean we we here to explore
it's fine worst case we just go back

5472
02:24:14,950 --> 02:24:14,960
it's fine worst case we just go back
 

5473
02:24:14,960 --> 02:24:18,030
it's fine worst case we just go back
wait wait how did you oh how did you get

5474
02:24:18,030 --> 02:24:18,040
wait wait how did you oh how did you get
 

5475
02:24:18,040 --> 02:24:20,910
wait wait how did you oh how did you get
there uh just uh in front of me

5476
02:24:20,910 --> 02:24:20,920
there uh just uh in front of me
 

5477
02:24:20,920 --> 02:24:22,510
there uh just uh in front of me
so you go

5478
02:24:22,510 --> 02:24:22,520
so you go
 

5479
02:24:22,520 --> 02:24:24,990
so you go
around yeah but I'm not really sure

5480
02:24:24,990 --> 02:24:25,000
around yeah but I'm not really sure
 

5481
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,070
around yeah but I'm not really sure
where to go from here I don't think it I

5482
02:24:27,070 --> 02:24:27,080
where to go from here I don't think it I
 

5483
02:24:27,080 --> 02:24:29,910
where to go from here I don't think it I
don't think it helps what I've

5484
02:24:29,910 --> 02:24:29,920
don't think it helps what I've
 

5485
02:24:29,920 --> 02:24:33,389
don't think it helps what I've
done yeah there's buttons here too which

5486
02:24:33,389 --> 02:24:33,399
done yeah there's buttons here too which
 

5487
02:24:33,399 --> 02:24:37,750
done yeah there's buttons here too which
some people say the buttons uh show like

5488
02:24:37,750 --> 02:24:37,760
some people say the buttons uh show like
 

5489
02:24:37,760 --> 02:24:41,230
some people say the buttons uh show like
the way to the next like jumpy platforms

5490
02:24:41,230 --> 02:24:41,240
the way to the next like jumpy platforms
 

5491
02:24:41,240 --> 02:24:43,590
the way to the next like jumpy platforms
but it doesn't really because it shows

5492
02:24:43,590 --> 02:24:43,600
but it doesn't really because it shows
 

5493
02:24:43,600 --> 02:24:47,150
but it doesn't really because it shows
you maybe we do need a

5494
02:24:47,150 --> 02:24:47,160

 

5495
02:24:47,160 --> 02:24:49,950

potion I don't the potion okay listen I

5496
02:24:49,950 --> 02:24:49,960
potion I don't the potion okay listen I
 

5497
02:24:49,960 --> 02:24:53,469
potion I don't the potion okay listen I
try to jump and are you at the bottom

5498
02:24:53,469 --> 02:24:53,479
try to jump and are you at the bottom
 

5499
02:24:53,479 --> 02:24:55,910
try to jump and are you at the bottom
yeah can you try leading another

5500
02:24:55,910 --> 02:24:55,920
yeah can you try leading another
 

5501
02:24:55,920 --> 02:24:58,710
yeah can you try leading another
skeleton leading another there no more

5502
02:24:58,710 --> 02:24:58,720
skeleton leading another there no more
 

5503
02:24:58,720 --> 02:25:01,070
skeleton leading another there no more
skeletons they go there's no more oh so

5504
02:25:01,070 --> 02:25:01,080
skeletons they go there's no more oh so
 

5505
02:25:01,080 --> 02:25:04,870
skeletons they go there's no more oh so
it is the maximum okay interesting

5506
02:25:04,870 --> 02:25:04,880
it is the maximum okay interesting
 

5507
02:25:04,880 --> 02:25:08,030
it is the maximum okay interesting
yeah let's see what if we may maybe the

5508
02:25:08,030 --> 02:25:08,040
yeah let's see what if we may maybe the
 

5509
02:25:08,040 --> 02:25:10,550
yeah let's see what if we may maybe the
the trees over there

5510
02:25:10,550 --> 02:25:10,560
the trees over there
 

5511
02:25:10,560 --> 02:25:12,150
the trees over there
connect

5512
02:25:12,150 --> 02:25:12,160
connect
 

5513
02:25:12,160 --> 02:25:16,389
connect
uh oh we can try uh growing those again

5514
02:25:16,389 --> 02:25:16,399
uh oh we can try uh growing those again
 

5515
02:25:16,399 --> 02:25:21,150
uh oh we can try uh growing those again
and see yeah if it maybe helps us

5516
02:25:21,150 --> 02:25:21,160
and see yeah if it maybe helps us
 

5517
02:25:21,160 --> 02:25:22,950
and see yeah if it maybe helps us
not sure CU those would be growing so

5518
02:25:22,950 --> 02:25:22,960
not sure CU those would be growing so
 

5519
02:25:22,960 --> 02:25:24,870
not sure CU those would be growing so
far

5520
02:25:24,870 --> 02:25:24,880

though okay one tree
 

5543
02:26:03,520 --> 02:26:07,990
though okay one tree
grow or what if there's no more

5544
02:26:07,990 --> 02:26:08,000
grow or what if there's no more
 

5545
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:09,469
grow or what if there's no more
skeletons down there I wonder can we Le

5546
02:26:09,469 --> 02:26:09,479
skeletons down there I wonder can we Le
 

5547
02:26:09,479 --> 02:26:12,710
skeletons down there I wonder can we Le
the skeleton down to the tree that we're

5548
02:26:12,710 --> 02:26:12,720
the skeleton down to the tree that we're
 

5549
02:26:12,720 --> 02:26:14,990
the skeleton down to the tree that we're
growing and grow it even more no because

5550
02:26:14,990 --> 02:26:15,000
growing and grow it even more no because
 

5551
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,190

want him to face the tree and then I

5578
02:26:53,030 --> 02:26:53,040
want him to face the tree and then I
 

5579
02:26:53,040 --> 02:26:54,630
want him to face the tree and then I
want to push him down of the sword

5580
02:26:54,630 --> 02:26:54,640
want to push him down of the sword
 

5581
02:26:54,640 --> 02:26:57,309
want to push him down of the sword
because then he falls down some momentum

5582
02:26:57,309 --> 02:26:57,319
because then he falls down some momentum
 

5583
02:26:57,319 --> 02:26:59,070
because then he falls down some momentum
have it might actually yeah if we clim

5584
02:26:59,070 --> 02:26:59,080
have it might actually yeah if we clim
 

5585
02:26:59,080 --> 02:27:00,750
have it might actually yeah if we clim
yeah it does it

5586
02:27:00,750 --> 02:27:00,760
yeah it does it
 

5587
02:27:00,760 --> 02:27:05,429
yeah it does it
connects it does it does w all right all

5588
02:27:05,429 --> 02:27:05,439
connects it does it does w all right all
 

5589
02:27:05,439 --> 02:27:07,030
connects it does it does w all right all
right all right all right all right all

right all right okay
 

5593
02:27:09,600 --> 02:27:12,830
right all right okay
maybe I want to come come here come here

5594
02:27:12,830 --> 02:27:12,840
maybe I want to come come here come here
 

5595
02:27:12,840 --> 02:27:14,870
maybe I want to come come here come here
come here I come okay probably enough if

5596
02:27:14,870 --> 02:27:14,880
come here I come okay probably enough if
 

5597
02:27:14,880 --> 02:27:16,710
come here I come okay probably enough if
we just grow this tree then if it's

5598
02:27:16,710 --> 02:27:16,720
we just grow this tree then if it's
 

5599
02:27:16,720 --> 02:27:18,590
we just grow this tree then if it's
connecting or oh maybe we need all of

5600
02:27:18,590 --> 02:27:18,600
connecting or oh maybe we need all of
 

5601
02:27:18,600 --> 02:27:20,469
connecting or oh maybe we need all of
them CU honestly it was really complic

5602
02:27:20,469 --> 02:27:20,479
them CU honestly it was really complic
 

5603
02:27:20,479 --> 02:27:25,550
them CU honestly it was really complic
to get the other CD the V vinyl yeah so

5604
02:27:25,550 --> 02:27:25,560
to get the other CD the V vinyl yeah so
 

5605
02:27:25,560 --> 02:27:26,910
to get the other CD the V vinyl yeah so
maybe if we jump from One Tree to the

5606
02:27:26,910 --> 02:27:26,920
maybe if we jump from One Tree to the
 

5607
02:27:26,920 --> 02:27:29,750
maybe if we jump from One Tree to the
other tree to the other tree yeah you

5608
02:27:29,750 --> 02:27:29,760
other tree to the other tree yeah you
 

5609
02:27:29,760 --> 02:27:34,750
other tree to the other tree yeah you
know maybe we'll bring it over here

5610
02:27:34,750 --> 02:27:34,760

 

5611
02:27:34,760 --> 02:27:37,349

because oh oh you think that's uh it

5612
02:27:37,349 --> 02:27:37,359
because oh oh you think that's uh it
 

5613
02:27:37,359 --> 02:27:40,590
because oh oh you think that's uh it
finished growing this one uh I feel like

5614
02:27:40,590 --> 02:27:40,600
finished growing this one uh I feel like
 

5615
02:27:40,600 --> 02:27:42,630
finished growing this one uh I feel like
wait where where it connects though are

5616
02:27:42,630 --> 02:27:42,640
wait where where it connects though are
 

5617
02:27:42,640 --> 02:27:45,230
wait where where it connects though are
you sure at the top if you come over to

5618
02:27:45,230 --> 02:27:45,240
you sure at the top if you come over to
 

5619
02:27:45,240 --> 02:27:46,990
you sure at the top if you come over to
where we are you can see that the tree

5620
02:27:46,990 --> 02:27:47,000
where we are you can see that the tree
 

5621
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:48,910
where we are you can see that the tree
is reaching out to the other tree and

5622
02:27:48,910 --> 02:27:48,920
is reaching out to the other tree and
 

5623
02:27:48,920 --> 02:27:51,990
is reaching out to the other tree and
you could probably make that jump

5624
02:27:51,990 --> 02:27:52,000
you could probably make that jump
 

5625
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:56,590
you could probably make that jump

think that is like it makes sense that
 

5719
02:30:28,080 --> 02:30:29,309
think that is like it makes sense that
there is one

5720
02:30:29,309 --> 02:30:29,319
there is one
 

5721
02:30:29,319 --> 02:30:32,550
there is one
though 100% like I I thought there was

5722
02:30:32,550 --> 02:30:32,560
though 100% like I I thought there was
 

5723
02:30:32,560 --> 02:30:34,550
though 100% like I I thought there was
something there the first time there's

5724
02:30:34,550 --> 02:30:34,560
something there the first time there's
 

5725
02:30:34,560 --> 02:30:37,230
something there the first time there's
there's a reason why these uh trees grow

5726
02:30:37,230 --> 02:30:37,240
there's a reason why these uh trees grow
 

5727
02:30:37,240 --> 02:30:39,150
there's a reason why these uh trees grow
this tall and not just as tall as we

5728

this tall and not just as tall as we
 

5729
