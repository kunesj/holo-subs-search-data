3760
01:46:27,229 --> 01:46:27,239
I can't go that far and the water hurts
 

3761
01:46:27,239 --> 01:46:35,770
I can't go that far and the water hurts

11594
05:39:34,010 --> 05:39:34,020
first of all I have two ideas that I
 

11595
05:39:34,020 --> 05:39:37,250
first of all I have two ideas that I
want to pitch to Yago

11598
05:39:39,170 --> 05:39:39,180
first of all
 

11599
05:39:39,180 --> 05:39:43,970
first of all
um next year please three days

11600
05:39:43,970 --> 05:39:43,980
um next year please three days
 

11601
05:39:43,980 --> 05:39:46,190
um next year please three days
or

11602
05:39:46,190 --> 05:39:46,200
or
 

11603
05:39:46,200 --> 05:39:47,448
or
um

11604
05:39:47,448 --> 05:39:47,458
um
 

11605
05:39:47,458 --> 05:39:50,090
um
let's assume we probably don't have I

11606
05:39:50,090 --> 05:39:50,100
let's assume we probably don't have I
 

11607
05:39:50,100 --> 05:39:52,310
let's assume we probably don't have I
mean I couldn't imagine that we would do

11608
05:39:52,310 --> 05:39:52,320
mean I couldn't imagine that we would do
 

11609
05:39:52,320 --> 05:39:55,550
mean I couldn't imagine that we would do
Holo 27 again which leaves us again with

11610
05:39:55,550 --> 05:39:55,560
Holo 27 again which leaves us again with
 

11611
05:39:55,560 --> 05:39:58,250
Holo 27 again which leaves us again with
only one concert per day so how about we

11612
05:39:58,250 --> 05:39:58,260
only one concert per day so how about we
 

11613
05:39:58,260 --> 05:40:00,830
only one concert per day so how about we
do either three days or two days but

11614
05:40:00,830 --> 05:40:00,840
do either three days or two days but
 

11615
05:40:00,840 --> 05:40:03,470
do either three days or two days but
like four concerts if we were able to

11616
05:40:03,470 --> 05:40:03,480
like four concerts if we were able to
 

11617
05:40:03,480 --> 05:40:05,990
like four concerts if we were able to
squeeze in the whole of 27 then we can

11618
05:40:05,990 --> 05:40:06,000
squeeze in the whole of 27 then we can
 

11619
05:40:06,000 --> 05:40:08,810
squeeze in the whole of 27 then we can
also do two concerts per day now the

11620
05:40:08,810 --> 05:40:08,820
also do two concerts per day now the
 

11621
05:40:08,820 --> 05:40:10,368
also do two concerts per day now the
problem is that it would overlap with

11622
05:40:10,368 --> 05:40:10,378
problem is that it would overlap with
 

11623
05:40:10,378 --> 05:40:12,830
problem is that it would overlap with
the Expo right so I actually have four

11624
05:40:12,830 --> 05:40:12,840
the Expo right so I actually have four
 

11625
05:40:12,840 --> 05:40:14,628
the Expo right so I actually have four
free pitches

11626
05:40:14,628 --> 05:40:14,638
free pitches
 

11627
05:40:14,638 --> 05:40:16,430
free pitches
um

11628
05:40:16,430 --> 05:40:16,440
um
 

11629
05:40:16,440 --> 05:40:17,990
um
I know this would probably be really

11630
05:40:17,990 --> 05:40:18,000
I know this would probably be really
 

11631
05:40:18,000 --> 05:40:20,270
I know this would probably be really
difficult to accommodate because I can

11632
05:40:20,270 --> 05:40:20,280
difficult to accommodate because I can
 

11633
05:40:20,280 --> 05:40:21,708
difficult to accommodate because I can
understand the feeling of wanting to

11634
05:40:21,708 --> 05:40:21,718
understand the feeling of wanting to
 

11635
05:40:21,718 --> 05:40:23,868
understand the feeling of wanting to
have the X-File and the Fest happening

11636
05:40:23,868 --> 05:40:23,878
have the X-File and the Fest happening
 

11637
05:40:23,878 --> 05:40:26,628
have the X-File and the Fest happening

yeah well it's already 1am I I thought I
maybe could

11962

this idea maybe we should make um

11972
05:48:49,190 --> 05:48:49,200
this idea maybe we should make um
 

11973
05:48:49,200 --> 05:48:52,670
this idea maybe we should make um
a petition

this small like ideally we should you

11980
05:48:58,250 --> 05:48:58,260
this small like ideally we should you
 

11981
05:48:58,260 --> 05:49:00,048
this small like ideally we should you
know get an even bigger screen and then

11982
05:49:00,048 --> 05:49:00,058
know get an even bigger screen and then
 

11983
05:49:00,058 --> 05:49:02,208
know get an even bigger screen and then
get this big like this is I think this

11984
05:49:02,208 --> 05:49:02,218
get this big like this is I think this
 

11985

05:49:54,110 --> 05:49:54,120
now with this size we could potentially
 

12021
05:49:54,120 --> 05:49:58,990
now with this size we could potentially
step on 20 people at once it's pretty

12022
05:49:58,990 --> 05:49:59,000
step on 20 people at once it's pretty
 

12023
05:49:59,000 --> 05:50:02,990

they're probably gonna like split the
 

12225
05:54:17,638 --> 05:54:20,270
they're probably gonna like split the
members even more and then if you have

12226
05:54:20,270 --> 05:54:20,280
members even more and then if you have
 

12227
05:54:20,280 --> 05:54:22,610
members even more and then if you have
like oh she's spread all across and it

12228
05:54:22,610 --> 05:54:22,620
like oh she's spread all across and it
 

12229
05:54:22,620 --> 05:54:25,490
like oh she's spread all across and it
kind of sucks because you then have to

12230
05:54:25,490 --> 05:54:25,500
kind of sucks because you then have to
 

12231
05:54:25,500 --> 05:54:27,230
kind of sucks because you then have to
yeah trying to get tickets for

12232
05:54:27,230 --> 05:54:27,240
yeah trying to get tickets for
 

12233
05:54:27,240 --> 05:54:29,330
yeah trying to get tickets for
everything and then it's really a low

12234
05:54:29,330 --> 05:54:29,340
everything and then it's really a low
 

12235
05:54:29,340 --> 05:54:31,548
everything and then it's really a low
chance to get even

12236
05:54:31,548 --> 05:54:31,558
chance to get even
 

12237
05:54:31,558 --> 05:54:34,310
chance to get even
uh more tickets and yeah

12238
05:54:34,310 --> 05:54:34,320
uh more tickets and yeah
 

12239
05:54:34,320 --> 05:54:36,350
uh more tickets and yeah
yeah it's difficult man

12240
05:54:36,350 --> 05:54:36,360
yeah it's difficult man
 

12241
05:54:36,360 --> 05:54:38,390
yeah it's difficult man
it's difficult but

12242
05:54:38,390 --> 05:54:38,400
it's difficult but
 

12243
05:54:38,400 --> 05:54:40,850
it's difficult but
I mean

12244
05:54:40,850 --> 05:54:40,860
I mean
 

12245
05:54:40,860 --> 05:54:44,628
I mean
at the same time we want to give more

12246
05:54:44,628 --> 05:54:44,638
at the same time we want to give more
 

12247
05:54:44,638 --> 05:54:46,310
at the same time we want to give more
opportunities to more people to see it

12248
05:54:46,310 --> 05:54:46,320
opportunities to more people to see it
 

12249
05:54:46,320 --> 05:54:47,510
opportunities to more people to see it
right so

12250
05:54:47,510 --> 05:54:47,520
right so
 

12251
05:54:47,520 --> 05:54:50,090
right so
if we can't get more seats we can't

12252
05:54:50,090 --> 05:54:50,100
if we can't get more seats we can't
 

12253
05:54:50,100 --> 05:54:52,670
if we can't get more seats we can't
force more seats into the venue

12254
05:54:52,670 --> 05:54:52,680
force more seats into the venue
 

12255
05:54:52,680 --> 05:54:57,230
force more seats into the venue

you can totally do is just because hello
 

12261
05:55:00,958 --> 05:55:02,810
you can totally do is just because hello
project did this too

12262
05:55:02,810 --> 05:55:02,820

you know when they're doing their uh

12264
05:55:05,208 --> 05:55:05,218

they repeat the same concert it's not

12268
05:55:12,230 --> 05:55:12,240
they repeat the same concert it's not
 

12269
05:55:12,240 --> 05:55:15,948
they repeat the same concert it's not
always different they have like

12270
05:55:15,948 --> 05:55:15,958
always different they have like
 

12271
05:55:15,958 --> 05:55:17,930
always different they have like
um I mean some things may be different
