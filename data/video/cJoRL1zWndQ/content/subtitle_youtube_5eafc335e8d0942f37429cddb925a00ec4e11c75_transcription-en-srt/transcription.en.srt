5846
02:58:01,510 --> 02:58:01,520
with this house because it's pretty
 

5847
02:58:01,520 --> 02:58:03,150
with this house because it's pretty
close to the no it's not close to the

5848

5849
02:58:03,160 --> 02:58:06,830
close to the no it's not close to the
tra there but like we can probably craft

5850
02:58:06,830 --> 02:58:06,840
tra there but like we can probably craft
 

5851
02:58:06,840 --> 02:58:12,429
tra there but like we can probably craft
something in here too go

5852
02:58:12,429 --> 02:58:12,439

 

5853
02:58:12,439 --> 02:58:15,030

down I don't know if that's a good idea

02:58:15,030 --> 02:58:15,040
down I don't know if that's a good idea
 

5855
02:58:15,040 --> 02:58:17,510
down I don't know if that's a good idea
we could use this as a second base maybe

5856
02:58:17,510 --> 02:58:17,520
we could use this as a second base maybe
 

5857
02:58:17,520 --> 02:58:20,710
we could use this as a second base maybe
could now that we secured it and the

5858
02:58:20,710 --> 02:58:20,720
could now that we secured it and the
 

5859
02:58:20,720 --> 02:58:22,349
could now that we secured it and the
doors are locked

5860
02:58:22,349 --> 02:58:22,359
doors are locked
 

5861
02:58:22,359 --> 02:58:26,950
doors are locked
so yeah it's like pretty secure for now

5862
02:58:26,950 --> 02:58:26,960
so yeah it's like pretty secure for now
