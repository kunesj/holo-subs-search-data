especially since that first time that
 

4058
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:46,229
especially since that first time that
something so big happened to me

4059
01:45:46,229 --> 01:45:46,239
something so big happened to me
 

4060
01:45:46,239 --> 01:45:49,910
something so big happened to me
um i think that probably really changed

4061
01:45:49,910 --> 01:45:49,920
um i think that probably really changed
 

4062
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:54,310
um i think that probably really changed
me a lot in when it comes to motivation

4063
01:45:54,310 --> 01:45:54,320
me a lot in when it comes to motivation
 

4064
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:58,310
me a lot in when it comes to motivation
and setbacks i guess yeah

4065
01:45:58,310 --> 01:45:58,320
and setbacks i guess yeah
 

4066
01:45:58,320 --> 01:46:02,070
and setbacks i guess yeah
i'm a fighter if something goes wrong

4067
01:46:02,070 --> 01:46:02,080
i'm a fighter if something goes wrong
 

4068
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:05,030
i'm a fighter if something goes wrong
i remember the time when things went

4069
01:46:05,030 --> 01:46:05,040
i remember the time when things went
 

4070
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:06,229
i remember the time when things went
really well

4071
01:46:06,229 --> 01:46:06,239
really well
 

4072
01:46:06,239 --> 01:46:09,510
really well
surprisingly and

4073
01:46:09,510 --> 01:46:09,520
surprisingly and
 

4074
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:11,830
surprisingly and
it just really shows that even if you

4075
01:46:11,830 --> 01:46:11,840
it just really shows that even if you
 

4076
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:13,510
it just really shows that even if you
think it's impossible and everyone else

4077
01:46:13,510 --> 01:46:13,520
think it's impossible and everyone else
 

4078
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:15,189
think it's impossible and everyone else
thinks impossible it's impossible

4079
01:46:15,189 --> 01:46:15,199
thinks impossible it's impossible
 

4080
01:46:15,199 --> 01:46:17,350
thinks impossible it's impossible
it's probably really quite difficult to

4081
01:46:17,350 --> 01:46:17,360
it's probably really quite difficult to
 

4082
01:46:17,360 --> 01:46:20,629
it's probably really quite difficult to
accomplish what you want to accomplish

4083
01:46:20,629 --> 01:46:20,639
accomplish what you want to accomplish
 

4084
01:46:20,639 --> 01:46:23,510
accomplish what you want to accomplish
actually you can do it if you try it the

4085
01:46:23,510 --> 01:46:23,520
actually you can do it if you try it the
 

4086
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:24,790
actually you can do it if you try it the
right way

4087
01:46:24,790 --> 01:46:24,800
right way
 

4088
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:26,629
right way
and if you try often enough and long

4089
01:46:26,629 --> 01:46:26,639
and if you try often enough and long
 

4090
01:46:26,639 --> 01:46:28,070
and if you try often enough and long
enough

4091
01:46:28,070 --> 01:46:28,080
enough
 

4092
01:46:28,080 --> 01:46:30,310
enough
you usually should be able to accomplish

4093
01:46:30,310 --> 01:46:30,320
you usually should be able to accomplish
 

4094
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:31,990
you usually should be able to accomplish
it

4095
01:46:31,990 --> 01:46:32,000
it
 

4096
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:35,669
it
phoenix mentality exactly

4097
01:46:35,669 --> 01:46:35,679
phoenix mentality exactly
 

4098
01:46:35,679 --> 01:46:37,350
phoenix mentality exactly
so i mean you probably can't go as far

4099
01:46:37,350 --> 01:46:37,360
so i mean you probably can't go as far
 

4100
01:46:37,360 --> 01:46:38,830
so i mean you probably can't go as far
as me to

4101
01:46:38,830 --> 01:46:38,840
as me to
 

4102
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:42,229
as me to
uh you know try so hard that you will

4103
01:46:42,229 --> 01:46:42,239
uh you know try so hard that you will
 

4104
01:46:42,239 --> 01:46:44,070
uh you know try so hard that you will
die

4105
01:46:44,070 --> 01:46:44,080
die
 

4106
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:45,430
die
that's probably too dangerous because

4107
01:46:45,430 --> 01:46:45,440
that's probably too dangerous because
 

4108
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:48,310
that's probably too dangerous because
you can't revive yourself

4109
01:46:48,310 --> 01:46:48,320
you can't revive yourself
 

4110
01:46:48,320 --> 01:46:51,189
you can't revive yourself
so try to a certain extent but also

4111
01:46:51,189 --> 01:46:51,199
so try to a certain extent but also
 

4112
01:46:51,199 --> 01:46:54,229
so try to a certain extent but also
don't feel bad about setbacks because

4113
01:46:54,229 --> 01:46:54,239
don't feel bad about setbacks because
 

4114
01:46:54,239 --> 01:46:55,750
don't feel bad about setbacks because
