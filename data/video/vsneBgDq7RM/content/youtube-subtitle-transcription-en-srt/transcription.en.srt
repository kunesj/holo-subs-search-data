when mokuku sees a message

it would be very very wrong of them to

3810
01:52:19,430 --> 01:52:19,440
it would be very very wrong of them to
 

3811
01:52:19,440 --> 01:52:22,910
it would be very very wrong of them to
confirm

3812
01:52:22,910 --> 01:52:22,920

 

3813
01:52:22,920 --> 01:52:25,430

yeah but even when I went to swimming

3814
01:52:25,430 --> 01:52:25,440
yeah but even when I went to swimming
 

3815
01:52:25,440 --> 01:52:29,090
yeah but even when I went to swimming
lessons like swimming like sometimes in

3816
01:52:29,090 --> 01:52:29,100
lessons like swimming like sometimes in
 

3817
01:52:29,100 --> 01:52:32,209
lessons like swimming like sometimes in
junior high school in high school they

3818
01:52:32,209 --> 01:52:32,219
junior high school in high school they
 

3819
01:52:32,219 --> 01:52:35,090
junior high school in high school they
didn't even make us go swimming I think

3820
01:52:35,090 --> 01:52:35,100
didn't even make us go swimming I think
 

3821
01:52:35,100 --> 01:52:37,729
didn't even make us go swimming I think
because they knew that we all didn't

3822
01:52:37,729 --> 01:52:37,739
because they knew that we all didn't
 

3823
01:52:37,739 --> 01:52:40,490
because they knew that we all didn't
want to

3824
01:52:40,490 --> 01:52:40,500

 

3825
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:43,070

um but in junior high school they would

3826
01:52:43,070 --> 01:52:43,080
um but in junior high school they would
 

3827
01:52:43,080 --> 01:52:45,890
um but in junior high school they would
often replace

3828
01:52:45,890 --> 01:52:45,900
often replace
 

3829
01:52:45,900 --> 01:52:49,790
often replace
the uh

3830
01:52:49,790 --> 01:52:49,800
the uh
 

3831
01:52:49,800 --> 01:52:53,330

the sports class with swimming

3832
01:52:53,330 --> 01:52:53,340
the sports class with swimming
 

3833

3834
01:52:55,910 --> 01:52:55,920
which in hindsight I think it's a nice
 

3835
01:52:55,920 --> 01:52:58,010
which in hindsight I think it's a nice
thing to do but for some reason children

3836
01:52:58,010 --> 01:52:58,020
thing to do but for some reason children
 

3837
01:52:58,020 --> 01:53:01,850
thing to do but for some reason children
are so against it

like slam it like I have to get in a
 

10456
05:07:57,718 --> 05:07:59,570
like slam it like I have to get in a
little bit with the knife and then I

10457
05:07:59,570 --> 05:07:59,580
little bit with the knife and then I
 

10458
05:07:59,580 --> 05:08:01,610
little bit with the knife and then I
have to slam it against The Cutting

10459
05:08:01,610 --> 05:08:01,620
have to slam it against The Cutting
 

10460
05:08:01,620 --> 05:08:02,690
have to slam it against The Cutting
Board

10461
05:08:02,690 --> 05:08:02,700
Board
 

10462
05:08:02,700 --> 05:08:05,570
Board
to get through

10463
05:08:05,570 --> 05:08:05,580
to get through
 

10464
05:08:05,580 --> 05:08:08,150
to get through
um they're so hard to slice

10465
05:08:08,150 --> 05:08:08,160
um they're so hard to slice
 

10466
05:08:08,160 --> 05:08:10,128
um they're so hard to slice
just boil them first makes it easier to

10467
05:08:10,128 --> 05:08:10,138
just boil them first makes it easier to
 

10468
05:08:10,138 --> 05:08:13,070
just boil them first makes it easier to
feel the peeling wasn't the issue really

10469
05:08:13,070 --> 05:08:13,080
feel the peeling wasn't the issue really
 

10470
05:08:13,080 --> 05:08:15,530
feel the peeling wasn't the issue really
cutting is the issue but the recipe says

10471
05:08:15,530 --> 05:08:15,540
cutting is the issue but the recipe says
 

10472
05:08:15,540 --> 05:08:17,690
cutting is the issue but the recipe says
to not boil them first because that's

10473
05:08:17,690 --> 05:08:17,700
to not boil them first because that's
 

10474
05:08:17,700 --> 05:08:19,610
to not boil them first because that's
not how the recipe goes you boil them

10475
05:08:19,610 --> 05:08:19,620
not how the recipe goes you boil them
 

10476
05:08:19,620 --> 05:08:22,010
not how the recipe goes you boil them
boil them with all the other things

10477
05:08:22,010 --> 05:08:22,020
boil them with all the other things
 

10478
05:08:22,020 --> 05:08:25,190
boil them with all the other things
but yeah

10479
05:08:25,190 --> 05:08:25,200

 

10480
05:08:25,200 --> 05:08:27,230

is your knife sharpened

10481
05:08:27,230 --> 05:08:27,240
is your knife sharpened
 

10482
05:08:27,240 --> 05:08:29,930
is your knife sharpened
probably not uh but still I still think

10483
05:08:29,930 --> 05:08:29,940
probably not uh but still I still think
 

10484
05:08:29,940 --> 05:08:31,430
probably not uh but still I still think
it would be very difficult to get

10485
05:08:31,430 --> 05:08:31,440
it would be very difficult to get
 

10486
05:08:31,440 --> 05:08:32,690
it would be very difficult to get
through but my knives are probably

10487
05:08:32,690 --> 05:08:32,700
through but my knives are probably
 

10488
05:08:32,700 --> 05:08:36,110
through but my knives are probably
really dense yeah because they're um

10489
05:08:36,110 --> 05:08:36,120
really dense yeah because they're um
 

10490
05:08:36,120 --> 05:08:38,868
really dense yeah because they're um
they're out of ceramic

10491
05:08:38,868 --> 05:08:38,878
they're out of ceramic
 

10492
05:08:38,878 --> 05:08:40,610
they're out of ceramic
so I don't know I don't think I could

10493
05:08:40,610 --> 05:08:40,620
so I don't know I don't think I could
 

10494
05:08:40,620 --> 05:08:43,910
so I don't know I don't think I could
even sharpen it but now

10495
05:08:43,910 --> 05:08:43,920
even sharpen it but now
 

10496
05:08:43,920 --> 05:08:45,650
even sharpen it but now
I've had them for

10497
05:08:45,650 --> 05:08:45,660
I've had them for
 

10498
05:08:45,660 --> 05:08:49,190
I've had them for
a couple years now

10499
05:08:49,190 --> 05:08:49,200

 

10500
05:08:49,200 --> 05:08:53,770

I think I bought them when I left Japan

10501
05:08:53,770 --> 05:08:53,780
I think I bought them when I left Japan
 

10502
05:08:53,780 --> 05:08:56,990
I think I bought them when I left Japan
okay then it's not it can't be that long

10503
05:08:56,990 --> 05:08:57,000
okay then it's not it can't be that long
 

10504
05:08:57,000 --> 05:08:59,868
okay then it's not it can't be that long
one two and a half years maybe

10505
05:08:59,868 --> 05:08:59,878
one two and a half years maybe
 

10506
05:08:59,878 --> 05:09:03,650
one two and a half years maybe
because I love Japan half a year into

10507
05:09:03,650 --> 05:09:03,660
because I love Japan half a year into
 

10508

10511
05:09:07,730 --> 05:09:07,740
so I've been using them for two and a
 

10512
