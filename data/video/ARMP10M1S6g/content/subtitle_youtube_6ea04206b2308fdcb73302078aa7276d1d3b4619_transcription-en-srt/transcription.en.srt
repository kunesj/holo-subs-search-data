let me see

1186
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:00,000
let me see
 

1187
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,910
let me see
below so I think like the foreman just

1188
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:02,920
below so I think like the foreman just
 

1189
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,790
below so I think like the foreman just
makes holes and there's no way the

1190
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:04,800
makes holes and there's no way the
 

1191
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,349
makes holes and there's no way the
foreman can know who's under or up

1192
00:38:07,349 --> 00:38:07,359
foreman can know who's under or up
 

1193
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:08,750
foreman can know who's under or up
because they're using

1194
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:08,760
because they're using
 

1195
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:15,270
because they're using
F1 so the one above has to be

1795
00:59:08,119 --> 00:59:09,750
teams I wonder if the others are
practicing this game a lot or if they

1796
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:09,760
practicing this game a lot or if they
 

1797
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:12,150
practicing this game a lot or if they
also just did it one time and then call

1798

also just did it one time and then call
 

1799
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,829

it a

1800
00:59:13,829 --> 00:59:13,839
it a
 

1801
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:15,950
it a
day at the same time I think there's

1802
00:59:15,950 --> 00:59:15,960
day at the same time I think there's
 

1803
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,789
day at the same time I think there's
really not much point to practicing too

1804
00:59:17,789 --> 00:59:17,799
really not much point to practicing too
 

1805

corner so it turns out there will be
 

1845
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:09,309
corner so it turns out there will be
three rounds and everybody there will be

1846
01:00:09,309 --> 01:00:09,319
three rounds and everybody there will be
 

1847
01:00:09,319 --> 01:00:11,470
three rounds and everybody there will be
six pairs against each other for those

1848
01:00:11,470 --> 01:00:11,480
six pairs against each other for those
 

1849
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:14,190
six pairs against each other for those
three rounds six pairs at the same time

three rounds six pairs at the same time
 

1851
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:18,470
three rounds six pairs at the same time
what the H yeah to be a lot more chaotic

what the H yeah to be a lot more chaotic
 

1853
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,349
what the H yeah to be a lot more chaotic
than we thought six pairs at the same

1854
01:00:20,349 --> 01:00:20,359
than we thought six pairs at the same
 

1855

contrast colors next to each other it's

1954
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:39,599
contrast colors next to each other it's
 

1955
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:40,990
contrast colors next to each other it's
okay I just have to look at my other

1956
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:41,000
okay I just have to look at my other
 

1957
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,910
okay I just have to look at my other
monitor okay okay then okay I was I just

1958
01:02:43,910 --> 01:02:43,920
monitor okay okay then okay I was I just
 

1959
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,430
monitor okay okay then okay I was I just
wanted to clear it up it's just cuz it's

1960
01:02:45,430 --> 01:02:45,440
wanted to clear it up it's just cuz it's
 

1961
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:47,109
wanted to clear it up it's just cuz it's
darker down here when I was at the top

1962
01:02:47,109 --> 01:02:47,119
darker down here when I was at the top
 

1963
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:48,750
darker down here when I was at the top
it wasn't although we use different

1964
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:48,760
it wasn't although we use different
 

1965
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:50,510
it wasn't although we use different
colors at the top but I think it's

1966
01:02:50,510 --> 01:02:50,520
colors at the top but I think it's
 

1967
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:53,670
colors at the top but I think it's
darker down here uh so maybe lighting

1968
01:02:53,670 --> 01:02:53,680
darker down here uh so maybe lighting
 

1969
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:55,230
darker down here uh so maybe lighting
will help more lighting down here a

1970
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:55,240
will help more lighting down here a
 

1971
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:58,589
will help more lighting down here a
little bit on honestly yeah I think uh

1972
01:02:58,589 --> 01:02:58,599
little bit on honestly yeah I think uh
 

1973
01:02:58,599 --> 01:03:00,710
little bit on honestly yeah I think uh

so maybe not necessarily going to the
center just

2622
01:23:10,270 --> 01:23:10,280
center just
 

2623
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:13,950

know that they'll maybe see oh they're
always in their own territory so they

2636
01:23:27,950 --> 01:23:27,960
always in their own territory so they
 

2637
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:30,510
always in their own territory so they
just go to our territory to fight

2638
01:23:30,510 --> 01:23:30,520
just go to our territory to fight
