playing it with viewers I don't know if

3106
01:25:20,330 --> 01:25:20,340
playing it with viewers I don't know if
 

3107
01:25:20,340 --> 01:25:22,370
playing it with viewers I don't know if
that's really I mean

3108
01:25:22,370 --> 01:25:22,380
that's really I mean
 

3109
01:25:22,380 --> 01:25:26,689
that's really I mean
it's a very long game each time then not

3110
01:25:26,689 --> 01:25:26,699
it's a very long game each time then not
 

3111
01:25:26,699 --> 01:25:28,070
it's a very long game each time then not
not that long actually I think she

3112
01:25:28,070 --> 01:25:28,080
not that long actually I think she
 

3113
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:29,450
not that long actually I think she
should

3114
01:25:29,450 --> 01:25:29,460
should
 

3115
01:25:29,460 --> 01:25:32,890
should
I think she does it like usually [\h__\h]

3116
01:25:32,890 --> 01:25:32,900
I think she does it like usually [\h__\h]
 

3117
01:25:32,900 --> 01:25:38,810
I think she does it like usually [\h__\h]
[\h__\h] one hour or two

01:25:38,810 --> 01:25:38,820

 

3119
01:25:38,820 --> 01:25:40,970

so

3120
01:25:40,970 --> 01:25:40,980
so
 

3121
01:25:40,980 --> 01:25:43,970
so
for [\h__\h] sake

3122
01:25:43,970 --> 01:25:43,980
for [\h__\h] sake
 

3123
