2275
01:07:49,799 --> 01:07:57,510
too ah wait wasn't it something like the
person who hosts it has to be online

2276
01:07:57,510 --> 01:07:57,520

 

2277
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:00,990

server okay I wonder how smoke did it

2284
01:08:11,910 --> 01:08:11,920
server okay I wonder how smoke did it
 

2285
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:13,870
server okay I wonder how smoke did it
because I I from the compilation I

2286
01:08:13,870 --> 01:08:13,880
because I I from the compilation I
 

2287
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:16,590
because I I from the compilation I
didn't see a single moment where they

2288

didn't see a single moment where they
 

2289
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:20,309
didn't see a single moment where they
they were completely
