201
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,990

everyone.  Well, this time, let's

202
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,000
everyone.  Well, this time, let's
 

203
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,830
everyone.  Well, this time, let's
start with the red team. I think it's

204
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:29,840
start with the red team. I think it's
 

205
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,829
start with the red team. I think it's
probably a good balance between the red teams. I don't

206
00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:33,839
probably a good balance between the red teams. I don't
 

207
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,269
probably a good balance between the red teams. I don't
think there's a lot of people, but

208
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:37,279
think there's a lot of people, but
 

209
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,630
think there's a lot of people, but
mostly there are too few white players and yellow players.  Is

210
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:39,640
mostly there are too few white players and yellow players.  Is
 

211
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,070
mostly there are too few white players and yellow players.  Is
it too little or is there too little red?

212
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:42,080
it too little or is there too little red?
 

213
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,829
it too little or is there too little red?
It doesn't look like it,

214
00:08:44,829 --> 00:08:47,430
It doesn't look like it,
 

215
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:51,870

753
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:56,909
doing a really, really good thing, you're beautiful, you're doing a really good thing. What's that?
When I was catching you, here I was,

754
00:26:56,909 --> 00:26:56,919
When I was catching you, here I was,
 

755
00:26:56,919 --> 00:26:58,190
When I was catching you, here I was,
squatting down,

756
00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:58,200
squatting down,
 

757
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,389
squatting down,
squatting down, and my senior was in a lot of pain. I was squatting down,

758
00:27:01,389 --> 00:27:03,750
squatting down, and my senior was in a lot of pain. I was squatting down,
 

759
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:03,760

 

760
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,549

behind that place.  But here

761
00:27:07,549 --> 00:27:07,559
behind that place.  But here
 

762
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,710
behind that place.  But here
it is, what is this white one?What do you call it

763
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:09,720
it is, what is this white one?What do you call it
 

764
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,029
it is, what is this white one?What do you call it
?A white one, a

765
00:27:13,029 --> 00:27:13,039
?A white one, a
 

766
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:17,389
?A white one, a
white one, yes, that's right.Here and there, here

767
00:27:17,389 --> 00:27:20,750

 

768
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:20,760

 

769
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:25,750

and there, yes, that's right, I was scuttling with the threads of the clouds, and then I

770
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:25,760
and there, yes, that's right, I was scuttling with the threads of the clouds, and then I
 

771
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,630
and there, yes, that's right, I was scuttling with the threads of the clouds, and then I
got caught and did Mi-chan.  It's hard to get

772
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:29,640
got caught and did Mi-chan.  It's hard to get
 

773
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:33,190
got caught and did Mi-chan.  It's hard to get
caught.

774
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:37,389
caught.
 

775
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:39,950

 

776
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:39,960

 

777
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:46,710

I mean, it's hard to get caught, or rather, if you're used, no matter how much you pull, you're very stubborn. I was taught that no matter what, you're so stubborn. I got

778
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:46,720

 

779
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,909


780
00:27:50,909 --> 00:27:50,919

 

781
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:56,509

caught. I said,

782
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:56,519

 

783
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:58,990


784
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:02,230

 

785
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:02,240

 

786
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,029

stop! Oh, but Sara-chan is running away.

787
00:28:06,029 --> 00:28:06,039
stop! Oh, but Sara-chan is running away.
 

788
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:11,630
stop! Oh, but Sara-chan is running away.
That's amazing.  I thought, ``This is crazy!'' It's a

789
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:11,640
That's amazing.  I thought, ``This is crazy!'' It's a
 

790
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,950
That's amazing.  I thought, ``This is crazy!'' It's a
big escape. It's

791
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:13,960
big escape. It's
 

792
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:17,310
big escape. It's
amazing, but it hasn't been found out. Maybe it's not

793
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:17,320
amazing, but it hasn't been found out. Maybe it's not
 

794
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:21,669
amazing, but it hasn't been found out. Maybe it's not
found out. It's dangerous, it's dangerous, no one should act. Hey

795
00:28:21,669 --> 00:28:21,679
found out. It's dangerous, it's dangerous, no one should act. Hey
 

796

00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,950

 

802
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:46,549

804
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:51,549

away, you're so hot, you're caught, Polka-san. It looks like you've escaped. Polka-san has devised a sure-fire way to win. Or, go ahead and do it, Polka. You've got to go into the clouds yourself.  That

805
00:28:51,549 --> 00:28:51,559

 

806
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:55,029

's right, it

811
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:03,870

might not be a good idea to crouch down and wait because it's a hassle and you end up putting it off until someone else gets caught.

812
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:03,880
might not be a good idea to crouch down and wait because it's a hassle and you end up putting it off until someone else gets caught.

00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:09,750
might not be a good idea to crouch down and wait because it's a hassle and you end up putting it off until someone else gets caught.
Ah, I see. It's because of all the cloud threads in the yellow group. It's kind of

814
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:14,389

 

815
00:29:14,389 --> 00:29:17,029

818
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:23,470

embarrassing, isn't it? Lyrica is so stupid. If she says things like paying money, it's a lie. It's dangerous. It's like an in-cap play. It's like a play. It's like I'm going to be played. I

Masa, this has changed so much that I was

2448
01:23:43,199 --> 01:23:47,229

Miko I thought it would be okay to throw it to the upper target yesterday, but it

2449
01:23:47,229 --> 01:23:47,239
Miko I thought it would be okay to throw it to the upper target yesterday, but it
 

2450
01:23:47,239 --> 01:23:51,350
Miko I thought it would be okay to throw it to the upper target yesterday, but it
was a high target because it passed quite a bit. There are a

2451
01:23:51,350 --> 01:23:51,360
was a high target because it passed quite a bit. There are a
 

2452
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:54,149
was a high target because it passed quite a bit. There are a
lot of choices around here, right? It's

2453
01:23:54,149 --> 01:23:54,159
lot of choices around here, right? It's
 

2454
01:23:54,159 --> 01:23:58,669
lot of choices around here, right? It's
like making that slight adjustment when falling. The

2455
01:23:58,669 --> 01:23:58,679
like making that slight adjustment when falling. The
 

2456
01:23:58,679 --> 01:24:01,910
like making that slight adjustment when falling. The
goal is nice. It's about 20 seconds away, so it's the

2457
01:24:01,910 --> 01:24:01,920
goal is nice. It's about 20 seconds away, so it's the
 

2458
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:05,830
goal is nice. It's about 20 seconds away, so it's the
highest.  It seems like it would be better to go somewhere else,

2459
01:24:05,830 --> 01:24:05,840
highest.  It seems like it would be better to go somewhere else,
 

2460
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:08,470
highest.  It seems like it would be better to go somewhere else,
but the course will be different on the next day,

2461
01:24:08,470 --> 01:24:08,480
but the course will be different on the next day,
 

2462
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:10,990
but the course will be different on the next day,
so I'm going to make some adjustments. It's the

2463
01:24:10,990 --> 01:24:11,000
so I'm going to make some adjustments. It's the
 

2464
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,910
so I'm going to make some adjustments. It's the
last one, so if you can practice this as much as you like, it'll

2465
01:24:13,910 --> 01:24:13,920
last one, so if you can practice this as much as you like, it'll
 

2466
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:16,070
last one, so if you can practice this as much as you like, it'll
be as good as the actual one. That's great.

2467
01:24:16,070 --> 01:24:16,080
be as good as the actual one. That's great.
 

2468

next time we'll do the replay, and we'll be able to do it pretty freely.

2487

practicing so many times. It's amazing. I don't even know what I was practicing just now without even starting. Oh yeah, but
if there's one more race, I'll do it at all, but I'll just walk normally.  I

2976
01:41:11,990 --> 01:41:14,830
if there's one more race, I'll do it at all, but I'll just walk normally.  I
 

2977
01:41:14,830 --> 01:41:14,840

 

2978
01:41:14,840 --> 01:41:19,229

wonder how different it is from that. Well, it's a bit different. Is it

2979
01:41:19,229 --> 01:41:19,239
wonder how different it is from that. Well, it's a bit different. Is it
 

2980
01:41:19,239 --> 01:41:22,910
wonder how different it is from that. Well, it's a bit different. Is it
okay if I don't use this system? Okay, I

2981
01:41:22,910 --> 01:41:22,920
okay if I don't use this system? Okay, I
 

2982
01:41:22,920 --> 01:41:24,589
okay if I don't use this system? Okay, I

2983
01:41:24,589 --> 01:41:24,599

 

2984
01:41:24,599 --> 01:41:28,470

didn't eat bread just now. Yes, there's a

2985
01:41:28,470 --> 01:41:28,480
didn't eat bread just now. Yes, there's a
 

2986
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:31,629
didn't eat bread just now. Yes, there's a
rule that says you can't eat bread. I

2987
01:41:31,629 --> 01:41:31,639
rule that says you can't eat bread. I
 

2988
01:41:31,639 --> 01:41:33,790
rule that says you can't eat bread. I
didn't eat it.  That's right, I don't have to eat either,

2989
01:41:33,790 --> 01:41:33,800
didn't eat it.  That's right, I don't have to eat either,
 

2990
01:41:33,800 --> 01:41:37,189
didn't eat it.  That's right, I don't have to eat either,
but if I don't eat, I won't be able to recover my physical strength, so it

2991
01:41:37,189 --> 01:41:37,199
but if I don't eat, I won't be able to recover my physical strength, so it
 

2992
01:41:37,199 --> 01:41:40,709
but if I don't eat, I won't be able to recover my physical strength, so it
will slow me down.I do

2993
01:41:40,709 --> 01:41:40,719
will slow me down.I do

will slow me down.I do
n't have to eat, but if I'm full, I'll eat.  I want you to

2995
01:41:43,910 --> 01:41:43,920
n't have to eat, but if I'm full, I'll eat.  I want you to
 

2996
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:47,390
n't have to eat, but if I'm full, I'll eat.  I want you to
take the pas that you

2997
01:41:47,390 --> 01:41:47,400
take the pas that you
 

2998
01:41:47,400 --> 01:41:52,629
take the pas that you
didn't get. I think it's better to get the pas. Yeah,

2999
01:41:52,629 --> 01:41:52,639
didn't get. I think it's better to get the pas. Yeah,
 

3000
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:57,109
didn't get. I think it's better to get the pas. Yeah,
no, I don't want to take them. Even if I

3001
01:41:57,109 --> 01:41:57,119
no, I don't want to take them. Even if I
 

3002
01:41:57,119 --> 01:41:59,310
no, I don't want to take them. Even if I
don't get them, I can still reach the goal, so yeah, I don't know if I

3003
01:41:59,310 --> 01:41:59,320
don't get them, I can still reach the goal, so yeah, I don't know if I
 

3004
01:41:59,320 --> 01:42:02,109
don't get them, I can still reach the goal, so yeah, I don't know if I
want that. It's quite difficult.

3005
01:42:02,109 --> 01:42:02,119
want that. It's quite difficult.
 

3006
01:42:02,119 --> 01:42:05,790
want that. It's quite difficult.
So you don't have to take it and eat it.You

3007
01:42:05,790 --> 01:42:05,800
So you don't have to take it and eat it.You

violation of the rules if you

3013
01:42:14,950 --> 01:42:14,960
violation of the rules if you
 

3014
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:18,310
violation of the rules if you
don't eat it?Japanese people always don't take it.  Well,

don't eat it?Japanese people always don't take it.  Well,
 

3016

don't eat it?Japanese people always don't take it.  Well,
that's the rule, right? Well, Miko, I'd

3017
01:42:22,430 --> 01:42:26,030
that's the rule, right? Well, Miko, I'd

This is it. It was Fu-chan who made a real video
 

3119

This is it. It was Fu-chan who made a real video

have to do it straight like this.  We

3130
01:45:54,510 --> 01:45:54,520
have to do it straight like this.  We
 

3131
01:45:54,520 --> 01:45:57,709
have to do it straight like this.  We
have to do something. In Japan, if you do

3147
01:46:24,119 --> 01:46:27,550

there is a way to go almost without hitting the pool.Is there a way to avoid hitting the pool?  There's

3148
01:46:27,550 --> 01:46:30,830
there is a way to go almost without hitting the pool.Is there a way to avoid hitting the pool?  There's
 

3149
01:46:30,830 --> 01:46:30,840

 

3150
01:46:30,840 --> 01:46:34,629

no way to conquer it, it's too difficult to get to the bottom. I

3151
01:46:34,629 --> 01:46:34,639
no way to conquer it, it's too difficult to get to the bottom. I
 

3152
01:46:34,639 --> 01:46:38,189
no way to conquer it, it's too difficult to get to the bottom. I
want to write something other than the bottom. When I write anything other

3153
01:46:38,189 --> 01:46:38,199
want to write something other than the bottom. When I write anything other
 

3154
01:46:38,199 --> 01:46:43,229
want to write something other than the bottom. When I write anything other
than the bottom, I can tell by those three lines.

3155
01:46:43,229 --> 01:46:43,239
than the bottom, I can tell by those three lines.
 

3156
01:46:43,239 --> 01:46:47,990
than the bottom, I can tell by those three lines.
There are three lines,

3157
01:46:47,990 --> 01:46:48,000
There are three lines,
 

3158
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,910
There are three lines,
haha.

3159
01:46:50,910 --> 01:46:50,920
haha.
 

3160
01:46:50,920 --> 01:46:53,910
haha.
If you go below the bottom, you'll never hit

3161
01:46:53,910 --> 01:46:53,920
If you go below the bottom, you'll never hit
 

3162
01:46:53,920 --> 01:46:58,430
If you go below the bottom, you'll never hit
it. That's amazing, but the

3163
01:46:58,430 --> 01:46:58,440
it. That's amazing, but the
 

3164
01:46:58,440 --> 01:47:03,149
it. That's amazing, but the
top and the middle are easy to hit,

3165
01:47:03,149 --> 01:47:03,159
top and the middle are easy to hit,
 

3166
01:47:03,159 --> 01:47:06,030
top and the middle are easy to hit,
so if you sink to the bottom and only come up when the bottom comes up.

3167
01:47:06,030 --> 01:47:06,040
so if you sink to the bottom and only come up when the bottom comes up.
 

3168
01:47:06,040 --> 01:47:08,910
so if you sink to the bottom and only come up when the bottom comes up.
If you're that bad, basically  It's

3169
01:47:08,910 --> 01:47:08,920
If you're that bad, basically  It's
 

3170
01:47:08,920 --> 01:47:13,629
If you're that bad, basically  It's
okay, once you're on base, all you have to do is go to the top.

3171
01:47:13,629 --> 01:47:13,639
okay, once you're on base, all you have to do is go to the top.
 

3172
01:47:13,639 --> 01:47:19,310
okay, once you're on base, all you have to do is go to the top.
That's amazing. The sky is here for the Kaishi group. It's amazing. It's

3173
01:47:19,310 --> 01:47:19,320

 

3174
01:47:19,320 --> 01:47:23,790

basic, except for the bottom. Even

3175
01:47:23,790 --> 01:47:23,800
basic, except for the bottom. Even
 

3176
01:47:23,800 --> 01:47:26,550
basic, except for the bottom. Even
if you don't collide and hit at the bottom, if you

3177
01:47:26,550 --> 01:47:26,560
if you don't collide and hit at the bottom, if you
 

3178
01:47:26,560 --> 01:47:29,589
if you don't collide and hit at the bottom, if you
push the pace just a little, you'll be able to go up.  I

3179
01:47:29,589 --> 01:47:31,149
push the pace just a little, you'll be able to go up.  I
 

3180
01:47:31,149 --> 01:47:31,159

 

3181
01:47:31,159 --> 01:47:35,830

think I can go a little ahead of time without bumping into things that much. That's

3182
01:47:35,830 --> 01:47:35,840

 

3183
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:38,990

great. Well, based on this one time, it

3184
01:47:38,990 --> 01:47:39,000
great. Well, based on this one time, it
 

3185
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:43,870
great. Well, based on this one time, it
's stable. It's safe. It's coming, but it

3186
01:47:43,870 --> 01:47:43,880
's stable. It's safe. It's coming, but it
 

3187
01:47:43,880 --> 01:47:47,550
's stable. It's safe. It's coming, but it
's stable. It's true that it's stable. Don't run at the cherry blossom spot. It's faster to

3188
01:47:47,550 --> 01:47:47,560
's stable. It's true that it's stable. Don't run at the cherry blossom spot. It's faster to
 

3189
01:47:47,560 --> 01:47:50,830
's stable. It's true that it's stable. Don't run at the cherry blossom spot. It's faster to
watch the timing and fly.

3190
01:47:50,830 --> 01:47:50,840
watch the timing and fly.
 

3191
01:47:50,840 --> 01:47:54,109
watch the timing and fly.
That's a character complex, isn't it? It's

3192
01:47:54,109 --> 01:47:54,119
That's a character complex, isn't it? It's
 

3193
01:47:54,119 --> 01:47:56,870
That's a character complex, isn't it? It's
better not to worry too much about jumps.

3194
01:47:56,870 --> 01:47:56,880
better not to worry too much about jumps.
 

3195
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:59,350
better not to worry too much about jumps.
Maybe jump dash is the fastest,

3196
01:47:59,350 --> 01:47:59,360
Maybe jump dash is the fastest,
 

3197
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:02,030
Maybe jump dash is the fastest,
but when you camp dash, there are a lot of failures. Oh

3198
01:48:02,030 --> 01:48:04,070
but when you camp dash, there are a lot of failures. Oh
 

3199
01:48:04,070 --> 01:48:04,080

 

3200
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:08,070

yeah, I don't know the timing. You know, maybe it's the stairs.  First

3201
01:48:08,070 --> 01:48:08,080
yeah, I don't know the timing. You know, maybe it's the stairs.  First
 

3202
01:48:08,080 --> 01:48:10,709
yeah, I don't know the timing. You know, maybe it's the stairs.  First
jump After that, press and hold to continue.Jump,

3203
01:48:10,709 --> 01:48:10,719
jump After that, press and hold to continue.Jump,
 

3204
01:48:10,719 --> 01:48:13,669
jump After that, press and hold to continue.Jump,
press and hold to continue.  I wonder

3205
01:48:13,669 --> 01:48:18,510
press and hold to continue.  I wonder
 

3206
01:48:18,510 --> 01:48:21,990

 

3207
01:48:21,990 --> 01:48:23,390

 

3208
01:48:23,390 --> 01:48:23,400

 

3209
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:26,430

if it's good or not. Hunting is the same for me.

3210
01:48:26,430 --> 01:48:26,440
if it's good or not. Hunting is the same for me.
 

3211
01:48:26,440 --> 01:48:29,589
if it's good or not. Hunting is the same for me.
Honestly, the

3212
01:48:29,589 --> 01:48:29,599
Honestly, the
 

3213
01:48:29,599 --> 01:48:35,149
Honestly, the
problem on that day was pretty amazing. I see,

3214
01:48:35,149 --> 01:48:35,159
problem on that day was pretty amazing. I see,
 

3215
01:48:35,159 --> 01:48:38,589
problem on that day was pretty amazing. I see,
but I'm a little worried about the polka characters that come off with repeated hits,

3216
01:48:38,589 --> 01:48:38,599
but I'm a little worried about the polka characters that come off with repeated hits,
 

3217
01:48:38,599 --> 01:48:41,149
but I'm a little worried about the polka characters that come off with repeated hits,
so I want to do it later.

3218
01:48:41,149 --> 01:48:41,159
so I want to do it later.
 

3219

Maybe the title is a princess, and it's definitely a princess. How long will they keep calling her a princess? It

I'd like to try it a little bit. I'm wondering

3355
01:52:37,149 --> 01:52:37,159
I'd like to try it a little bit. I'm wondering
 

3356
01:52:37,159 --> 01:52:40,310
I'd like to try it a little bit. I'm wondering
how hard it is to catch this

3357
01:52:40,310 --> 01:52:40,320
how hard it is to catch this
 

3358
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:44,430
how hard it is to catch this
thing. I guess it's just a cage feeling, but it

3359
01:52:44,430 --> 01:52:46,669
thing. I guess it's just a cage feeling, but it
 

3360

3362
01:52:52,510 --> 01:52:52,520
doesn't really catch me, so I
 

3363
01:52:52,520 --> 01:52:55,589
doesn't really catch me, so I
think it's better to be behind it. I think the strings of clouds behind it are better.  It's

3364
01:52:55,589 --> 01:52:55,599
think it's better to be behind it. I think the strings of clouds behind it are better.  It's
 

3365
01:52:55,599 --> 01:52:57,990
think it's better to be behind it. I think the strings of clouds behind it are better.  It's
okay, right, right in front of the cage

3366
01:52:57,990 --> 01:52:58,000
okay, right, right in front of the cage
 

3367
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:01,430
okay, right, right in front of the cage
, but it's dangerous in the end, because it's close, so

3368
01:53:01,430 --> 01:53:01,440
, but it's dangerous in the end, because it's close, so
 

3369
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:03,669

this place isn't good. It's because I'm close. That's why I intentionally

a bit confusing to the left, but there was an explanation that if you left-click, you'd be able to release the rope, but yeah, it's really a bit of a bit of a

written in the rulebook that you
 

3447
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:27,310
written in the rulebook that you
should catch it.It said that you should catch it on the right and then release it when it turned left.Well, I

3448
01:55:27,310 --> 01:55:27,320
should catch it.It said that you should catch it on the right and then release it when it turned left.Well, I

01:55:27,320 --> 01:55:30,750
should catch it.It said that you should catch it on the right and then release it when it turned left.Well, I
guess I'll

guess I'll
 

3451
01:55:30,760 --> 01:55:35,470
guess I'll
try it once.That's right.

3452
01:55:35,470 --> 01:55:35,480
try it once.That's right.
 

3453

try it once.That's right.
Fold it to the left and insert it.  I

3454
01:55:39,350 --> 01:55:39,360
Fold it to the left and insert it.  I
 

3455
01:55:39,360 --> 01:55:41,790
Fold it to the left and insert it.  I
think so, but I don't think it can be unlocked.Yes, I don't

01:55:46,229 --> 01:55:46,239
think it can be unlocked, but there are only
 

3459
01:55:46,239 --> 01:55:48,589
think it can be unlocked, but there are only
two people left.It looks like there are

01:55:48,589 --> 01:55:48,599
two people left.It looks like there are
 

3461
01:55:48,599 --> 01:55:53,910
two people left.It looks like there are
two people running now, so it's already a festival.You must

3462
01:55:53,910 --> 01:55:53,920
two people running now, so it's already a festival.You must
 

3463
01:55:53,920 --> 01:56:00,149
two people running now, so it's already a festival.You must
be wrong.People who don't have the theme.  I guess that's

3464
01:56:00,149 --> 01:56:00,159
be wrong.People who don't have the theme.  I guess that's
 

3465
01:56:00,159 --> 01:56:03,629
be wrong.People who don't have the theme.  I guess that's
what it would be like if someone was caught, right? That's not the point. When a

3466
01:56:03,629 --> 01:56:03,639
what it would be like if someone was caught, right? That's not the point. When a
 

3467
01:56:03,639 --> 01:56:05,790
what it would be like if someone was caught, right? That's not the point. When a
person gets caught, they get fired and

3468
01:56:05,790 --> 01:56:05,800
person gets caught, they get fired and
 

3469
01:56:05,800 --> 01:56:10,310
person gets caught, they get fired and
turn into a venue. Or maybe it becomes a venue or an auto venue.

3470
01:56:10,310 --> 01:56:10,320
turn into a venue. Or maybe it becomes a venue or an auto venue.
 

3471
01:56:10,320 --> 01:56:14,189
turn into a venue. Or maybe it becomes a venue or an auto venue.
Oh yeah, it's not like if they go all the way to Ao.

3472
01:56:14,189 --> 01:56:14,199
Oh yeah, it's not like if they go all the way to Ao.
 

3473

Oh yeah, it's not like if they go all the way to Ao.

trouble, stop it, I

3490
01:56:47,149 --> 01:56:47,159
trouble, stop it, I
 

3491

3493
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:53,350
don't like you, I don't like you, why?  I
couldn't stop thinking about it. Maybe I

3494
01:56:53,350 --> 01:56:53,360
couldn't stop thinking about it. Maybe I
 

3495
01:56:53,360 --> 01:56:55,750
couldn't stop thinking about it. Maybe I
like it. Sora-chan moves quite boldly. I

3496
01:56:55,750 --> 01:56:55,760
like it. Sora-chan moves quite boldly. I
 

3497
01:56:55,760 --> 01:56:58,390
like it. Sora-chan moves quite boldly. I
wonder if she should just keep running in this game. Even

3498
01:56:58,390 --> 01:56:58,400
wonder if she should just keep running in this game. Even
 

3499
01:56:58,400 --> 01:57:02,109
wonder if she should just keep running in this game. Even
if I'm running, some people are

3500
01:57:02,109 --> 01:57:02,119
if I'm running, some people are
 

3501
01:57:02,119 --> 01:57:04,270
if I'm running, some people are
running, and some people aren't.  Is it

3502
01:57:04,270 --> 01:57:04,280
running, and some people aren't.  Is it
 

3503
01:57:04,280 --> 01:57:06,709
running, and some people aren't.  Is it
better to stay or is it

3504
01:57:06,709 --> 01:57:06,719
better to stay or is it
 

3505
01:57:06,719 --> 01:57:10,149
better to stay or is it
better? Is it true that everyone runs together? I

3506
01:57:10,149 --> 01:57:10,159
better? Is it true that everyone runs together? I
 

3507
01:57:10,159 --> 01:57:12,350
better? Is it true that everyone runs together? I
don't know if we all run together, so it's better not to stay in one place.  I wonder

3508
01:57:12,350 --> 01:57:14,470
don't know if we all run together, so it's better not to stay in one place.  I wonder
 

3509
01:57:14,470 --> 01:57:14,480

 

3510
01:57:14,480 --> 01:57:17,350

if it's like a stack kill or something like

3511
01:57:17,350 --> 01:57:17,360
if it's like a stack kill or something like
 

3512
01:57:17,360 --> 01:57:21,109
if it's like a stack kill or something like
that. If you're chased like that, someone will definitely end up like that. So

3513
01:57:21,109 --> 01:57:21,119
that. If you're chased like that, someone will definitely end up like that. So
 

3514
01:57:21,119 --> 01:57:27,109
that. If you're chased like that, someone will definitely end up like that. So
even if the festival comes or goes, this is still going on. It's

3515
01:57:27,109 --> 01:57:27,119
even if the festival comes or goes, this is still going on. It's
 

3516
01:57:27,119 --> 01:57:29,350
even if the festival comes or goes, this is still going on. It's
practice, so let's have them catch it. So,

3517
01:57:29,350 --> 01:57:29,360
practice, so let's have them catch it. So,
 

3518
01:57:29,360 --> 01:57:34,750
practice, so let's have them catch it. So,

we should follow Sora-chan's style.
 

3741

3806
02:06:38,040 --> 02:06:41,030
n't know.  So let's do it here. Let's see how difficult it is to
pull it off. It

3807
02:06:41,030 --> 02:06:41,040
pull it off. It
 

3808
02:06:41,040 --> 02:06:46,069
pull it off. It
's an experiment, sure, but it doesn't matter what happened earlier, I wonder

3809
02:06:46,069 --> 02:06:46,079
's an experiment, sure, but it doesn't matter what happened earlier, I wonder
 

3810
02:06:46,079 --> 02:06:50,669
's an experiment, sure, but it doesn't matter what happened earlier, I wonder
if it turned out normal. Everyone,

3811
02:06:50,669 --> 02:06:50,679
if it turned out normal. Everyone,
 

3812
02:06:50,679 --> 02:06:55,390
if it turned out normal. Everyone,
don't hide it, it's dangerous, Noel.

3813
02:06:55,390 --> 02:06:59,450
don't hide it, it's dangerous, Noel.
 

3814
02:06:59,450 --> 02:06:59,460

 

3815
02:06:59,460 --> 02:07:05,990

[Laughs]

3816
02:07:05,990 --> 02:07:06,000

 

3817
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:14,990

At that time, I was Su-senpai,

3818
02:07:14,990 --> 02:07:21,910

 

3819
02:07:21,910 --> 02:07:21,920

 

3820
02:07:21,920 --> 02:07:24,629

so I was like, Wow, this place is really strong. I don't want that. I was

3821
02:07:24,629 --> 02:07:24,639
so I was like, Wow, this place is really strong. I don't want that. I was
 

3822
02:07:24,639 --> 02:07:29,870
so I was like, Wow, this place is really strong. I don't want that. I was
suddenly warped to this area.  That

3823
02:07:29,870 --> 02:07:33,629
suddenly warped to this area.  That
 

3824
02:07:33,629 --> 02:07:33,639

 

3825
02:07:33,639 --> 02:07:37,149

's right.

3826
02:07:37,149 --> 02:07:42,669
's right.
 

3827
02:07:42,669 --> 02:07:42,679

 

3828
02:07:42,679 --> 02:07:45,149

Maybe it's because it's bad, but if there's just one more person, it's all over. I see. It's just

3829
02:07:45,149 --> 02:07:45,159
Maybe it's because it's bad, but if there's just one more person, it's all over. I see. It's just
 

3830
02:07:45,159 --> 02:07:49,189
Maybe it's because it's bad, but if there's just one more person, it's all over. I see. It's just
hard to hook it to something, but I

3831
02:07:49,189 --> 02:07:49,199
hard to hook it to something, but I
 

3832
02:07:49,199 --> 02:07:51,390
hard to hook it to something, but I
guess it's easy to catch it and take it with me.

3833
02:07:51,390 --> 02:07:51,400
guess it's easy to catch it and take it with me.
 

3834
02:07:51,400 --> 02:07:54,229
guess it's easy to catch it and take it with me.
After all, you can't move. I

3835
02:07:54,229 --> 02:07:54,239
After all, you can't move. I
 

3836
02:07:54,239 --> 02:07:56,629
After all, you can't move. I
like the empty style of running around, but what's

3837
02:07:56,629 --> 02:07:56,639
like the empty style of running around, but what's
 

3838
02:07:56,639 --> 02:07:59,030
like the empty style of running around, but what's
wrong with your eyes? I was running around this time, right

3839
02:07:59,030 --> 02:07:59,040
wrong with your eyes? I was running around this time, right
 

3840
02:07:59,040 --> 02:08:02,069
wrong with your eyes? I was running around this time, right
? I was running around,

3841
02:08:02,069 --> 02:08:02,079
? I was running around,
 

3842
02:08:02,079 --> 02:08:04,549
? I was running around,
but I got caught. Yeah, I was able to run away once, but then I

3843
02:08:04,549 --> 02:08:04,559
but I got caught. Yeah, I was able to run away once, but then I
 

3844
02:08:04,559 --> 02:08:07,430
but I got caught. Yeah, I was able to run away once, but then I
got caught.  But for some reason, it's

3845
02:08:07,430 --> 02:08:07,440
got caught.  But for some reason, it's
 

3846
02:08:07,440 --> 02:08:09,510
got caught.  But for some reason, it's
okay as long as you don't go towards it yourself.I

3847
02:08:09,510 --> 02:08:09,520
okay as long as you don't go towards it yourself.I
 

3848
02:08:09,520 --> 02:08:11,990
okay as long as you don't go towards it yourself.I
see, if you don't know who the demon is and

3849
02:08:11,990 --> 02:08:12,000
see, if you don't know who the demon is and
 

3850
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,669
see, if you don't know who the demon is and
go towards it, you'll get caught, but now that you're running around, you ca

3851
02:08:14,669 --> 02:08:14,679
go towards it, you'll get caught, but now that you're running around, you ca
 

3852
02:08:14,679 --> 02:08:16,750
go towards it, you'll get caught, but now that you're running around, you ca
n't tell who the demon is.

3853
02:08:16,750 --> 02:08:19,589
n't tell who the demon is.
 

3854
02:08:19,589 --> 02:08:21,390

 

3855
02:08:21,390 --> 02:08:21,400

 

3856
02:08:21,400 --> 02:08:25,790

No way, I don't understand it at all, so I just walked right in front of him. That's

3857
02:08:25,790 --> 02:08:28,629
No way, I don't understand it at all, so I just walked right in front of him. That's
 

3858
02:08:28,629 --> 02:08:33,589

 

3859
02:08:33,589 --> 02:08:33,599

 

3860
02:08:33,599 --> 02:08:37,470

right. The moment Noel and I laid eyes on each other, I was ready to die. I thought it was over, but I was caught.

3861
02:08:37,470 --> 02:08:37,480
right. The moment Noel and I laid eyes on each other, I was ready to die. I thought it was over, but I was caught.
 

3862
02:08:37,480 --> 02:08:40,510
right. The moment Noel and I laid eyes on each other, I was ready to die. I thought it was over, but I was caught.
That's right. I was prepared. I

3863
02:08:40,510 --> 02:08:40,520
That's right. I was prepared. I
 

3864
02:08:40,520 --> 02:08:44,069
That's right. I was prepared. I
can't stand up anymore. This will probably

3865
02:08:44,069 --> 02:08:44,079
can't stand up anymore. This will probably
 

3866
02:08:44,079 --> 02:08:46,669
can't stand up anymore. This will probably
be the end of the hunt. That's

3867
02:08:46,669 --> 02:08:46,679
be the end of the hunt. That's
 

3868
02:08:46,679 --> 02:08:52,510
be the end of the hunt. That's
right. I want to do voice work. I want to do it again.

3869
02:08:52,510 --> 02:08:52,520
right. I want to do voice work. I want to do it again.
 

3870
02:08:52,520 --> 02:08:54,629
right. I want to do voice work. I want to do it again.
I want to hurry up, wait a minute,

3871
02:08:54,629 --> 02:08:54,639
I want to hurry up, wait a minute,
 

3872
02:08:54,639 --> 02:08:56,669
I want to hurry up, wait a minute,

3882
02:09:18,790 --> 02:09:22,629
gotten into a fever.  That's not true.
 

3883
02:09:22,629 --> 02:09:26,830

 

3884

3885
02:09:26,840 --> 02:09:32,510

Even the letters start from the beginning, so that's all I can

3886
02:09:32,510 --> 02:09:32,520

 

3887
02:09:32,520 --> 02:09:37,189

say. I read it, but something disappeared. That's it,

say. I read it, but something disappeared. That's it,
 

3889

3893
02:09:43,360 --> 02:09:47,310
n't hear it.
Hey, but.  Is

3894
02:09:47,310 --> 02:09:47,320

 

3895
02:09:47,320 --> 02:09:50,750

this something? Wait a minute. Yes,

3896
02:09:50,750 --> 02:09:50,760
this something? Wait a minute. Yes,
 

3897
02:09:50,760 --> 02:09:54,709
this something? Wait a minute. Yes,
the vines are not like that. They just have a long start, and they

3898
02:09:54,709 --> 02:09:54,719
the vines are not like that. They just have a long start, and they
 

3899
02:09:54,719 --> 02:09:57,350
the vines are not like that. They just have a long start, and they
definitely won't fall. That's right. I was holding the vines for

3900
02:09:57,350 --> 02:09:57,360
definitely won't fall. That's right. I was holding the vines for
 

3901
02:09:57,360 --> 02:10:00,229
definitely won't fall. That's right. I was holding the vines for
a long time at the end. I was a little relaxed at the end. It would have been better to

3902
02:10:00,229 --> 02:10:00,239
a long time at the end. I was a little relaxed at the end. It would have been better to
 

3903
02:10:00,239 --> 02:10:01,790
a long time at the end. I was a little relaxed at the end. It would have been better to
go to the right at the end.

3904
02:10:01,790 --> 02:10:01,800
go to the right at the end.
 

3905
02:10:01,800 --> 02:10:05,430
go to the right at the end.
I can afford it, but I can't run in the opposite direction.That's

3906
02:10:05,430 --> 02:10:07,430
I can afford it, but I can't run in the opposite direction.That's
 

3907
02:10:07,430 --> 02:10:07,440

 

3908
02:10:07,440 --> 02:10:11,990

probably the easiest pool after all.It's

3909
02:10:11,990 --> 02:10:12,000
probably the easiest pool after all.It's
 

3910
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:17,229
probably the easiest pool after all.It's
different from you guys who didn't put anything in the wrong place.I

3911
02:10:17,229 --> 02:10:17,239
different from you guys who didn't put anything in the wrong place.I
 

3912
02:10:17,239 --> 02:10:20,229
different from you guys who didn't put anything in the wrong place.I

3913
02:10:20,229 --> 02:10:20,239

 

3914
02:10:20,239 --> 02:10:23,790

can hear the laughter of the birds.  I

3915
02:10:23,790 --> 02:10:23,800
can hear the laughter of the birds.  I
 

3916
02:10:23,800 --> 02:10:28,189
can hear the laughter of the birds.  I
'm back to Mikomi Kochia 2.

3917
02:10:28,189 --> 02:10:28,199
'm back to Mikomi Kochia 2.
 

3918
02:10:28,199 --> 02:10:31,830
'm back to Mikomi Kochia 2.
That's

3919
02:10:31,830 --> 02:10:31,840

 

3920
02:10:31,840 --> 02:10:35,950

right. I'm going to close the streaming slot soon. I've been

3921
02:10:35,950 --> 02:10:35,960
right. I'm going to close the streaming slot soon. I've been
 

3922
02:10:35,960 --> 02:10:40,069
right. I'm going to close the streaming slot soon. I've been
streaming while I'm practicing. I'll also

3923
02:10:40,069 --> 02:10:40,079
streaming while I'm practicing. I'll also
 

3924
02:10:40,079 --> 02:10:43,750
streaming while I'm practicing. I'll also
be streaming. I think it's about time I

3925
02:10:43,750 --> 02:10:43,760
be streaming. I think it's about time I
 

3926
02:10:43,760 --> 02:10:47,229
be streaming. I think it's about time I
cut off that slot.  If you're going to practice something like that, you'll

3927
02:10:47,229 --> 02:10:47,239
cut off that slot.  If you're going to practice something like that, you'll
 

3928
02:10:47,239 --> 02:10:51,149
cut off that slot.  If you're going to practice something like that, you'll
have to practice in a different way.Okay, I'll

3929
02:10:51,149 --> 02:10:51,159
have to practice in a different way.Okay, I'll
 

3930
02:10:51,159 --> 02:10:53,149
have to practice in a different way.Okay, I'll
do the ass first.No, those who want to do it can do it, and

3931
02:10:53,149 --> 02:10:53,159
do the ass first.No, those who want to do it can do it, and
 

3932
02:10:53,159 --> 02:10:55,310
do the ass first.No, those who want to do it can do it, and
those who want to do it can do it at all.That

3933
02:10:55,310 --> 02:10:55,320
those who want to do it can do it at all.That
 

3934
02:10:55,320 --> 02:10:57,709
those who want to do it can do it at all.That
framework that I think is okay is still here.  I'll

3935
02:10:57,709 --> 02:10:57,719
framework that I think is okay is still here.  I'll
 

3936
02:10:57,719 --> 02:10:59,350
framework that I think is okay is still here.  I'll
probably go and bring it in for a while.Okay

3937
02:10:59,350 --> 02:10:59,360
probably go and bring it in for a while.Okay
 

3938
02:10:59,360 --> 02:11:02,950
probably go and bring it in for a while.Okay
, then I guess I'll just leave it as is.Okay,

3939
02:11:02,950 --> 02:11:06,390
, then I guess I'll just leave it as is.Okay,
 

3940
02:11:06,390 --> 02:11:06,400

 

3941
02:11:06,400 --> 02:11:12,549

this is it.It's that one from Unteshi, and it's

getting excited earlier.Which
 

3947
02:11:19,239 --> 02:11:23,270
getting excited earlier.Which
part is getting drunk?Minecraft is probably drunk.  I

3948
02:11:23,270 --> 02:11:23,280
part is getting drunk?Minecraft is probably drunk.  I
 

3949
02:11:23,280 --> 02:11:26,589
part is getting drunk?Minecraft is probably drunk.  I
think it's going to be a problem, oh, the knight's

3950
02:11:26,589 --> 02:11:26,599
think it's going to be a problem, oh, the knight's
 

3951
02:11:26,599 --> 02:11:31,709
think it's going to be a problem, oh, the knight's
guy has a lot of fang line, oh fang line, fang line, fang

3952
02:11:31,709 --> 02:11:31,719
guy has a lot of fang line, oh fang line, fang line, fang

02:11:36,390 --> 02:11:36,400
line.The screen shakes a lot.  On
 

3955
02:11:36,400 --> 02:11:40,750
line.The screen shakes a lot.  On
the other hand, I'm jumping

3956
02:11:40,750 --> 02:11:40,760
the other hand, I'm jumping
 

3957
02:11:40,760 --> 02:11:44,790
the other hand, I'm jumping
up and down, so it's better. Is it on top? If it's on top, it might be redundant. It's

3958
02:11:44,790 --> 02:11:44,800
up and down, so it's better. Is it on top? If it's on top, it might be redundant. It's
 

3959
02:11:44,800 --> 02:11:49,109
up and down, so it's better. Is it on top? If it's on top, it might be redundant. It's
not my intention, it's more of a movement. It's

3960
02:11:49,109 --> 02:11:49,119
not my intention, it's more of a movement. It's
 

3961
02:11:49,119 --> 02:11:52,430
not my intention, it's more of a movement. It's

3962
02:11:52,430 --> 02:11:52,440

better than before. I'm going to practice after this.  It's
 

3967
02:11:59,760 --> 02:12:02,589
better than before. I'm going to practice after this.  It's
okay to do it all, but it seems like I'm going to close it all once,

3968
02:12:02,589 --> 02:12:02,599
okay to do it all, but it seems like I'm going to close it all once,
 

3969

02:18:08,750 --> 02:18:08,760

 

4156
02:18:08,760 --> 02:18:10,150

please do so. Wait a minute, wait a minute, please. Please go ahead. I'll

4157

please do so. Wait a minute, wait a minute, please. Please go ahead. I'll
 

4158
02:18:10,160 --> 02:18:12,629
please do so. Wait a minute, wait a minute, please. Please go ahead. I'll
ask you a few questions.  I

4159
02:18:12,629 --> 02:18:12,639
ask you a few questions.  I
 

4160
02:18:12,639 --> 02:18:16,750
ask you a few questions.  I
have a question, but what is that? You

4161
02:18:16,750 --> 02:18:16,760
have a question, but what is that? You
 

4162
02:18:16,760 --> 02:18:19,309
have a question, but what is that? You
make something and then you guess what it is. Well, the

4163
02:18:19,309 --> 02:18:19,319
make something and then you guess what it is. Well, the
 

4164
02:18:19,319 --> 02:18:23,669
make something and then you guess what it is. Well, the
knights are not allowed to talk,

4165
02:18:23,669 --> 02:18:23,679
knights are not allowed to talk,
 

4166
02:18:23,679 --> 02:18:27,629
knights are not allowed to talk,
right? Basically, they

4167
02:18:27,629 --> 02:18:27,639
right? Basically, they
 

4168
02:18:27,639 --> 02:18:31,349
right? Basically, they
don't say things like "U" or "U".  That's fine,

4169
02:18:31,349 --> 02:18:31,359
don't say things like "U" or "U".  That's fine,
 

4170
02:18:31,359 --> 02:18:34,469
don't say things like "U" or "U".  That's fine,
but words like ``This is that, this and that is always'' will

4171
02:18:34,469 --> 02:18:34,479
but words like ``This is that, this and that is always'' will
 

4172
02:18:34,479 --> 02:18:37,830
but words like ``This is that, this and that is always'' will
probably

4173
02:18:37,830 --> 02:18:37,840
probably
 

4174
02:18:37,840 --> 02:18:41,030
probably
get the message across, so words like ``Yeah, yeah, yeah, put green here'' and things like

4175
02:18:41,030 --> 02:18:41,040
get the message across, so words like ``Yeah, yeah, yeah, put green here'' and things like
 

4176
02:18:41,040 --> 02:18:44,429
get the message across, so words like ``Yeah, yeah, yeah, put green here'' and things like
that won't be used.

4177
02:18:44,429 --> 02:18:44,439
that won't be used.
 

4178
02:18:44,439 --> 02:18:48,270
that won't be used.
In that case, it's okay for the princess to talk, and the princess is also okay.If

In that case, it's okay for the princess to talk, and the princess is also okay.If
 

4180
02:18:48,280 --> 02:18:51,549
In that case, it's okay for the princess to talk, and the princess is also okay.If
it's the other way around, then the princess is talking and the

4181
02:18:51,549 --> 02:18:54,389
it's the other way around, then the princess is talking and the
 

4182
02:18:54,389 --> 02:18:54,399

 

4183
02:18:54,399 --> 02:18:58,629

knight shakes his head or nods up and down while asking if that thing is a refrigerator.  Do you

knight shakes his head or nods up and down while asking if that thing is a refrigerator.  Do you
 

4185
02:18:58,639 --> 02:19:02,669
knight shakes his head or nods up and down while asking if that thing is a refrigerator.  Do you
feel like it's a hit? No, it's okay. Is it okay?

4186
02:19:02,669 --> 02:19:06,349
feel like it's a hit? No, it's okay. Is it okay?
 

4187
02:19:06,349 --> 02:19:06,359

 

4188
02:19:06,359 --> 02:19:10,629

It's okay if it's not a word. I don't know, no, it's like that.

4189
02:19:10,629 --> 02:19:10,639
It's okay if it's not a word. I don't know, no, it's like that.
 

4190
02:19:10,639 --> 02:19:15,270
It's okay if it's not a word. I don't know, no, it's like that.
By the way, things like that princess's theme can

4191
02:19:15,270 --> 02:19:15,280
By the way, things like that princess's theme can
 

4192
02:19:15,280 --> 02:19:20,589
By the way, things like that princess's theme can
change on the day.  Too

4193
02:19:20,589 --> 02:19:20,599
change on the day.  Too
 

4194
02:19:20,599 --> 02:19:24,549
change on the day.  Too
In terms of title, the first half of the story is

4195
02:19:24,549 --> 02:19:24,559
In terms of title, the first half of the story is
 

4196
02:19:24,559 --> 02:19:28,469
In terms of title, the first half of the story is
not exactly the same. It's random after all, so if you

4197
02:19:28,469 --> 02:19:30,790
not exactly the same. It's random after all, so if you
 

4198
02:19:30,790 --> 02:19:30,800

 

4199
02:19:30,800 --> 02:19:33,950

play it with the red team, for example, there will

4200
02:19:33,950 --> 02:19:33,960
play it with the red team, for example, there will
 

4201
02:19:33,960 --> 02:19:36,270
play it with the red team, for example, there will
be things like a lot of paprika or a lot of refrigerators.

4202
02:19:36,270 --> 02:19:36,280
be things like a lot of paprika or a lot of refrigerators.
 

4203
02:19:36,280 --> 02:19:39,190
be things like a lot of paprika or a lot of refrigerators.
Miko thinks so,

4204
02:19:39,190 --> 02:19:39,200
Miko thinks so,
 

4205
02:19:39,200 --> 02:19:42,110
Miko thinks so,
but yeah, it seems like it's

4206
02:19:42,110 --> 02:19:42,120
but yeah, it seems like it's
 

4207
02:19:42,120 --> 02:19:45,589
but yeah, it seems like it's
random, so I don't

4208
02:19:45,589 --> 02:19:45,599
random, so I don't
 

4209
02:19:45,599 --> 02:19:48,110
random, so I don't
really understand, but it seems like someone just

4210
02:19:48,110 --> 02:19:48,120
really understand, but it seems like someone just
 

4211
02:19:48,120 --> 02:19:51,830
really understand, but it seems like someone just
happened to be angry, so I guess it's just a random thing.  The

4212
02:19:51,830 --> 02:19:51,840
happened to be angry, so I guess it's just a random thing.  The
 

4213
02:19:51,840 --> 02:19:56,429
happened to be angry, so I guess it's just a random thing.  The
question is, is there a possibility that the same thing will come out again even if the one that is out now doesn't change?

4214
02:19:56,429 --> 02:19:58,990
question is, is there a possibility that the same thing will come out again even if the one that is out now doesn't change?
 

4215
02:19:58,990 --> 02:19:59,000

 

4216
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:03,270

That's right. By the way, the

4217
02:20:03,270 --> 02:20:03,280
That's right. By the way, the
 

4218
02:20:03,280 --> 02:20:07,389
That's right. By the way, the
first half of the creative people who make it

4219
02:20:07,389 --> 02:20:07,399
first half of the creative people who make it
 

4220
02:20:07,399 --> 02:20:10,750
first half of the creative people who make it
don't change all that much, but the second question is on that

4221
02:20:10,750 --> 02:20:10,760
don't change all that much, but the second question is on that
 

4222
02:20:10,760 --> 02:20:15,070
don't change all that much, but the second question is on that
day.

4223
02:20:15,070 --> 02:20:15,080
day.
 

4224
02:20:15,080 --> 02:20:19,070
day.
Does that mean there will be a special theme for Japan? Yes, it could very well be that theme. Yes, yes, yes, yes,

4232
02:20:26,439 --> 02:20:30,550
yes. Yes, yes. What about the orchestra? There will

be some changes, but I don't think it will interfere with that.
 

4234
02:20:30,560 --> 02:20:36,070
be some changes, but I don't think it will interfere with that.
It's not a thing, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

4258
02:21:22,200 --> 02:21:25,469
want to cut things off. They've already
disbanded. Yeah, I want to do it. They've disbanded quite a bit. But we can

4259
02:21:25,469 --> 02:21:25,479
disbanded. Yeah, I want to do it. They've disbanded quite a bit. But we can
 

4260
02:21:25,479 --> 02:21:28,309
disbanded. Yeah, I want to do it. They've disbanded quite a bit. But we can
practice even if those three teams aren't all together, so it

4261
02:21:28,309 --> 02:21:28,319
practice even if those three teams aren't all together, so it
 

4262
02:21:28,319 --> 02:21:31,590
practice even if those three teams aren't all together, so it
depends on how well we can

4263
02:21:31,590 --> 02:21:31,600
depends on how well we can
 

4264
02:21:31,600 --> 02:21:34,349
depends on how well we can
do it. Hey, let's do it. Everyone, just
