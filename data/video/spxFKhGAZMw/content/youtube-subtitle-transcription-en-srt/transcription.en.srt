is like in the middle and the other one
 

593
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,350
is like in the middle and the other one
i don't have that one i think we'll have

594
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:51,360
i don't have that one i think we'll have
 

595
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,829
i don't have that one i think we'll have
to make something like that is there

596
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:53,839
to make something like that is there
 

597
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,350
to make something like that is there
like

598
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:55,360
like
 

599
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,269
like
i don't know this one is

600
00:14:59,269 --> 00:14:59,279
i don't know this one is
 

601
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,350
i don't know this one is
uh

602
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:01,360
uh
 

603
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,030
uh
this one's only used to make other

604
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:03,040
this one's only used to make other
 

605
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,509
this one's only used to make other
things but it just doesn't show

606
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:05,519
things but it just doesn't show
 

607
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,069
things but it just doesn't show
like it's a basic basal component i

608
00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:08,079
like it's a basic basal component i
 

609
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,850
like it's a basic basal component i
think

610
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:10,860
think
 

611
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:14,870
think
[Music]

612
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:14,880

 

613
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,189

pb was made out of p e and f r but o x

614
00:15:19,189 --> 00:15:19,199
pb was made out of p e and f r but o x
 

615
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,590
pb was made out of p e and f r but o x
is like a base component

616
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:21,600
is like a base component
 

617
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,550
is like a base component
unless we can do it the other way around

618
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:24,560
unless we can do it the other way around
 

619
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,509
unless we can do it the other way around
like

620
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:25,519
like
 

621
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,670
like
going both directions

622
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:27,680
going both directions
 

623
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,790
going both directions
like like making out of pb making p e

624
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:30,800
like like making out of pb making p e
 

625
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,470
like like making out of pb making p e
and uh

626
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:32,480
and uh
 

627
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,710
and uh
yeah i think there's like an extractor

628
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:34,720
yeah i think there's like an extractor
 

629
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,189
yeah i think there's like an extractor
yeah there's an extractor

630
00:15:37,189 --> 00:15:37,199
yeah there's an extractor
 

631
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,069
yeah there's an extractor
oh

632
00:15:38,069 --> 00:15:38,079
oh
 

633
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,870
oh
yeah you can split it into two in that

634
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:40,880
yeah you can split it into two in that
 

635
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,230
yeah you can split it into two in that
case

636
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:42,240
case
 

637
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,150
case
if you have because we are trying to

638
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:44,160
if you have because we are trying to
 

639
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,430
if you have because we are trying to
make

640
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:45,440
make
 

641
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,350
make
am right now i guess i don't know if you

642
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:47,360
am right now i guess i don't know if you
 

643
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,470
am right now i guess i don't know if you
even have am or po that we would be able

644
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:50,480
even have am or po that we would be able
 

645
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,590
even have am or po that we would be able
to extract ox i don't know what those

646
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:53,600
to extract ox i don't know what those
 

647
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,430
to extract ox i don't know what those
are i'll just read the names we need ox

648
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:57,440
are i'll just read the names we need ox
 

649
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,310
are i'll just read the names we need ox
but no we need we need pb and ox in

650
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:00,320
but no we need we need pb and ox in
 

651
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,310
but no we need we need pb and ox in
order to make a.m

652
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:02,320
order to make a.m
 

653
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,069
order to make a.m
so rx is part of am and ox is part of a

654
00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:06,079
so rx is part of am and ox is part of a
 

655
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:10,790
so rx is part of am and ox is part of a
different one people what makes ox again

656
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:10,800
different one people what makes ox again
 

657
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,790
different one people what makes ox again
uh

658
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:12,800
uh
 

659
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,269
uh
i am and p-o

i am and p-o
 

661
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,990
i am and p-o
okay wait what makes the ones

662
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,000
okay wait what makes the ones
 

663
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,949
okay wait what makes the ones
uh

664
00:16:18,949 --> 00:16:18,959

665
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,030
uh
what is them

666
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:21,040
what is them
 

667
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,509
what is them
wait when you say what makes ox um like

668
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:23,519
wait when you say what makes ox um like
 

669
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,670
wait when you say what makes ox um like
there's nothing here that says ox is

670
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:25,680
there's nothing here that says ox is
 

671
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,710
there's nothing here that says ox is
made by this and this but you can split

672
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:28,720
made by this and this but you can split
 

673
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,069
made by this and this but you can split
um

674
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:30,079
um
 

675
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,590
um
two other ones

676
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:31,600
two other ones
 

677
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,550
two other ones
okay so what what are the two other ones

678
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:34,560
okay so what what are the two other ones
 

679
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,110
okay so what what are the two other ones
that you could split it

680
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:37,120
that you could split it
 

681
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,710
that you could split it
um

682
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:38,720
um
 

683
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,910
um
uh

684
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:39,920
uh
 

685
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,430
uh
am and po

686
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:41,440
am and po
 

687
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,910
am and po
so basically there's a tree here okay

688
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:43,920
so basically there's a tree here okay
 

689
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,910
so basically there's a tree here okay
from the very bottom that it was p e and

690
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:45,920
from the very bottom that it was p e and
 

691
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,550
from the very bottom that it was p e and
f r we did that and we got pb and then

692
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:48,560
f r we did that and we got pb and then
 

693
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,550
f r we did that and we got pb and then
if we would move upwards

maybe the colors have some significance
 

2523
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:47,270
maybe the colors have some significance
as well yeah because um

as well yeah because um
 

2525
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,630
as well yeah because um
so like the

they could look in any direction because
 

2621
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,750
they could look in any direction because
i can spin them

okay maybe you need to have them look in
the same direction as they look from me

2628
00:58:42,390 --> 00:58:42,400
the same direction as they look from me
 

2629
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,390

all right i see
uh so when you trigger the lever what it

2652
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:07,760
uh so when you trigger the lever what it
 

2653
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:10,470
uh so when you trigger the lever what it
does is it does correspond to like the

2654
00:59:10,470 --> 00:59:10,480
does is it does correspond to like the
 

2655
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,549
does is it does correspond to like the
yellow one like you said

2656
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:12,559
yellow one like you said
 

2657
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:14,789
yellow one like you said
corresponds to it but what happens is

2658
00:59:14,789 --> 00:59:14,799
corresponds to it but what happens is
 

2659
00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:16,150
corresponds to it but what happens is
that um

2660
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:16,160
that um
 

2661
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:19,910
that um
it switches the rotation so

2662
00:59:19,910 --> 00:59:19,920
it switches the rotation so
 

2663
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,549
it switches the rotation so
now instead of turning uh clockwise it's

2664
00:59:22,549 --> 00:59:22,559
now instead of turning uh clockwise it's
 

2665
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,710
now instead of turning uh clockwise it's
turning counterclockwise

2666
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:24,720
turning counterclockwise
 

2667
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,630
turning counterclockwise
now i have three of them facing the same

2668
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:26,640
now i have three of them facing the same
 

2669
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:29,270
now i have three of them facing the same
direction and i suppose maybe i'm

2670
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:29,280
direction and i suppose maybe i'm
 

2671
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,030
direction and i suppose maybe i'm
supposed to copy

2672
00:59:31,030 --> 00:59:31,040
supposed to copy
 

2673
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,309
supposed to copy
like uh

2674
00:59:32,309 --> 00:59:32,319
like uh
 

2675
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:33,670
like uh
you think they should all be facing the

2676
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:33,680
you think they should all be facing the
 

2677
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:37,030
you think they should all be facing the
same direction

2678
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:37,040

 

2679
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,390

like recently i've been reading a book
about simulations

5064
01:49:22,629 --> 01:49:22,639
about simulations
 

5065
01:49:22,639 --> 01:49:24,870
about simulations
and like

5066
01:49:24,870 --> 01:49:24,880
and like
 

5067
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:26,790
and like
simulations world building is pretty

5068
01:49:26,790 --> 01:49:26,800
simulations world building is pretty
 

5069
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:28,790
simulations world building is pretty
intense yeah it's about building a

intense yeah it's about building a
 

5071
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:30,629
intense yeah it's about building a
simulation that

5072
01:49:30,629 --> 01:49:30,639
simulation that
 

5073
01:49:30,639 --> 01:49:32,470
simulation that
is complicated but essentially they're

5074
01:49:32,470 --> 01:49:32,480
is complicated but essentially they're
 

5075

how they kind of
 

5085
01:49:44,159 --> 01:49:46,550
how they kind of
uh evolve into you know like more

5086
01:49:46,550 --> 01:49:46,560
uh evolve into you know like more
 

5087
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:48,550
uh evolve into you know like more
advanced things from there and yeah i

5088

guess

5090
01:49:50,070 --> 01:49:50,080
guess
 

5091
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:52,070
guess
i mean i get it but it's like

5092
01:49:52,070 --> 01:49:52,080
i mean i get it but it's like
 

5093
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:53,270
i mean i get it but it's like
yeah it's

5094
01:49:53,270 --> 01:49:53,280
yeah it's
 

5095
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:55,990
yeah it's
it's a bit much sometimes

5096

it's a bit much sometimes
 

5097
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:57,910
it's a bit much sometimes
that's

5098
01:49:57,910 --> 01:49:57,920
that's
 

5099
01:49:57,920 --> 01:49:59,189
that's
that's probably not something that i

5100
01:49:59,189 --> 01:49:59,199
that's probably not something that i
 

5101
01:49:59,199 --> 01:50:02,310
that's probably not something that i

i'm just trying to get through it but

5104
01:50:03,510 --> 01:50:03,520
i'm just trying to get through it but

01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:05,030
i'm just trying to get through it but
it's kind of interesting because i i

5106
01:50:05,030 --> 01:50:05,040

5108
01:50:06,390 --> 01:50:06,400
like reading it because it talks about
 

5109
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:08,629
like reading it because it talks about
like some time relativity stuff and like

5110
01:50:08,629 --> 01:50:08,639
like some time relativity stuff and like
 

5111
01:50:08,639 --> 01:50:10,550
like some time relativity stuff and like
going through experiments because when

5112
01:50:10,550 --> 01:50:10,560
going through experiments because when
 

5113
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:12,470
going through experiments because when
you're uploaded to that virtual world

5114
01:50:12,470 --> 01:50:12,480
you're uploaded to that virtual world
 

5115
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:14,709
you're uploaded to that virtual world
like uh you experience time differently

5116
01:50:14,709 --> 01:50:14,719
like uh you experience time differently
 

5117
01:50:14,719 --> 01:50:15,589
like uh you experience time differently
so

5118
01:50:15,589 --> 01:50:15,599
so
 

5119
01:50:15,599 --> 01:50:17,430
so
that's pretty interesting

5120
01:50:17,430 --> 01:50:17,440
that's pretty interesting
 

5121
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:18,310
