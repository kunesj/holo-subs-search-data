14893
07:25:33,780 --> 07:25:39,468

oh [\h__\h] is

14894
07:25:39,468 --> 07:25:39,478

 

14895
07:25:39,478 --> 07:25:42,890

we are doing

14896
07:25:42,890 --> 07:25:42,900

 

14897
07:25:42,900 --> 07:25:44,990

I think I make a thumbnail after I wake

14898
07:25:44,990 --> 07:25:45,000
I think I make a thumbnail after I wake
 

14899

14901
07:25:45,900 --> 07:25:48,708

I can't even test it out yet I think

14906
07:25:54,468 --> 07:25:54,478
I can't even test it out yet I think
 

14907
07:25:54,478 --> 07:25:56,390
I can't even test it out yet I think
because it's not really

14908
07:25:56,390 --> 07:25:56,400
because it's not really
 

14909
07:25:56,400 --> 07:25:58,730
because it's not really
set up just yet but

14910
07:25:58,730 --> 07:25:58,740
set up just yet but
 

14911
07:25:58,740 --> 07:26:03,468
set up just yet but
it will be a bit gitty-gitty after all

14912
07:26:03,468 --> 07:26:03,478
it will be a bit gitty-gitty after all
 

14913
07:26:03,478 --> 07:26:05,208
it will be a bit gitty-gitty after all
I think

14914
07:26:05,208 --> 07:26:05,218
I think
 

14915
07:26:05,218 --> 07:26:11,330
I think
from what I saw in my Discord

14916
07:26:11,330 --> 07:26:11,340

 

14917
07:26:11,340 --> 07:26:13,548
