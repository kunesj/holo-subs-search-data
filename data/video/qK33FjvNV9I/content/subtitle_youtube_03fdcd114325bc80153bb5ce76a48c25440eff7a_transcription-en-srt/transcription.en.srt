do that because I it was kind of like
 

3671
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:55,470
do that because I it was kind of like
time pressured but now it doesn't matter

3672

time pressured but now it doesn't matter
 

3673
01:43:55,480 --> 01:43:57,990
time pressured but now it doesn't matter
cuz like I changed my plans and there's

3674
01:43:57,990 --> 01:43:58,000
cuz like I changed my plans and there's
 

3675
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,390
cuz like I changed my plans and there's
not really time pressure anymore and I'm

3676
01:44:00,390 --> 01:44:00,400
not really time pressure anymore and I'm
 

3677
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:02,310
not really time pressure anymore and I'm
going to Japan soon so I might as well

3678
01:44:02,310 --> 01:44:02,320
going to Japan soon so I might as well
 

3679
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:03,830
going to Japan soon so I might as well
pick it up if they would send it to

3680
01:44:03,830 --> 01:44:03,840
pick it up if they would send it to
 

3681
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:05,910
pick it up if they would send it to
Japan and then to me then that would be

3682
01:44:05,910 --> 01:44:05,920
Japan and then to me then that would be
 

3683
01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:07,950
Japan and then to me then that would be
annoying again cuz probably I would run

3684
01:44:07,950 --> 01:44:07,960
annoying again cuz probably I would run
 

3685
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:10,430
annoying again cuz probably I would run
into stupid stupid issues with the

3686
01:44:10,430 --> 01:44:10,440
into stupid stupid issues with the
 

3687
01:44:10,440 --> 01:44:13,669
into stupid stupid issues with the
Customs again and and yeah but if I can

3688
01:44:13,669 --> 01:44:13,679
Customs again and and yeah but if I can
 

3689
01:44:13,679 --> 01:44:18,709
Customs again and and yeah but if I can
pick it up then maybe it's

3690
01:44:18,709 --> 01:44:18,719

 

3691
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:21,709

fine so trying to figure out all that

3692
01:44:21,709 --> 01:44:21,719
fine so trying to figure out all that
 

3693
01:44:21,719 --> 01:44:23,510
fine so trying to figure out all that
kind of stuff too that

3694
01:44:23,510 --> 01:44:23,520
kind of stuff too that
 

3695
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:26,990
kind of stuff too that
now it would be easier if I can just

3696
01:44:26,990 --> 01:44:27,000
now it would be easier if I can just
 

3697
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:30,070
now it would be easier if I can just
pick it up but my trip is pretty short

3698
01:44:30,070 --> 01:44:30,080
pick it up but my trip is pretty short
 

3699
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:32,750
pick it up but my trip is pretty short
so if I just miss it you know that's

3700
01:44:32,750 --> 01:44:32,760
so if I just miss it you know that's
 

3701
01:44:32,760 --> 01:44:34,589
so if I just miss it you know that's
going to
