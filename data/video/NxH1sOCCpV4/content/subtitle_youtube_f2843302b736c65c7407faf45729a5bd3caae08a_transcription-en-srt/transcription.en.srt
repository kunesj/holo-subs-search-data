so cali has a couple blocks
 

2581
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,470
so cali has a couple blocks
i guess

2582
00:54:56,470 --> 00:54:56,480
i guess
 

2583
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:00,150
i guess
a diorite can be made into two slabs too

2584
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:00,160
a diorite can be made into two slabs too
 

2585
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:03,190
a diorite can be made into two slabs too
and and this time so i'll take that

2586
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:03,200
and and this time so i'll take that
 

2587
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,030
and and this time so i'll take that
if i have any other i mean worst case we

2588
00:55:05,030 --> 00:55:05,040
if i have any other i mean worst case we
 

2589
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:08,309
if i have any other i mean worst case we
can just get the end the end material

2590
00:55:08,309 --> 00:55:08,319
can just get the end the end material
 

2591
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:09,190
can just get the end the end material
yeah

2592
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:09,200

gotta be very careful with where we
 

2729

oh it's fine
 

2743
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,829
oh it's fine
f1 is something else f5 is like there's

2744
00:57:55,829 --> 00:57:55,839
f1 is something else f5 is like there's
 

2745
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:57,910
f1 is something else f5 is like there's
three different like angles that you can

2746
00:57:57,910 --> 00:57:57,920
three different like angles that you can
 

2747
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,670
three different like angles that you can
play yeah but i pressed f1 and now

2748

play yeah but i pressed f1 and now
 

2749
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:01,829
play yeah but i pressed f1 and now
everything's clear

2750
00:58:01,829 --> 00:58:01,839
everything's clear
 

2751
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:03,670
everything's clear
yeah yeah that's for like taking a good

2752
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:03,680
yeah yeah that's for like taking a good
 

2753
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,349
yeah yeah that's for like taking a good
picture i guess oh i can still walk

2754
00:58:05,349 --> 00:58:05,359
picture i guess oh i can still walk
 

2755
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:07,910
picture i guess oh i can still walk
around no you mean ah ah you mean you

2756
00:58:07,910 --> 00:58:07,920
around no you mean ah ah you mean you
 

2757
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:09,910
around no you mean ah ah you mean you
don't see the ah

2758
00:58:09,910 --> 00:58:09,920
don't see the ah
 

2759
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,150
don't see the ah
i think that's only with the shaders if

2760
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:12,160
i think that's only with the shaders if
 

2761
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,750
i think that's only with the shaders if
you turn the shaders off

2762
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:13,760
you turn the shaders off
 

2763
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,589
you turn the shaders off
then it um

2764
00:58:15,589 --> 00:58:15,599
then it um
 

2765
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:17,510
then it um
will not work i think that was a thing

2766
00:58:17,510 --> 00:58:17,520
will not work i think that was a thing
 

2767
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,670
will not work i think that was a thing
right right chad

2768
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:19,680
right right chad
 

2769
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:22,069
right right chad
only with the shaders on it removes the

2770
00:58:22,069 --> 00:58:22,079
only with the shaders on it removes the
 

2771
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:24,150
only with the shaders on it removes the
hp which i guess you can keep the

2772
00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:24,160
hp which i guess you can keep the
 

2773
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,910
hp which i guess you can keep the
shaders in the end we will see how it

2774
00:58:25,910 --> 00:58:25,920
shaders in the end we will see how it
 

2775
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,430
shaders in the end we will see how it
looks like for you maybe it's too dark

2776
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:27,440
looks like for you maybe it's too dark
 

2777
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,750
looks like for you maybe it's too dark
for you not sure no

2778
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:29,760
for you not sure no
 

2779
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,190
for you not sure no
no it'll still work that's kind of

2780
00:58:31,190 --> 00:58:31,200
no it'll still work that's kind of
 

2781
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,030
no it'll still work that's kind of
interesting but it turns off everything

2782
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:33,040
interesting but it turns off everything
 

2783
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:35,109
interesting but it turns off everything
so like i can't see what items i'm

2784
00:58:35,109 --> 00:58:35,119
so like i can't see what items i'm
 

2785
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:37,270

holding etcetera and that kind of stuff
 

2787
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:40,150
holding etcetera and that kind of stuff
yeah but this is nice but i am worried i

2788
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:40,160
yeah but this is nice but i am worried i
 

2789
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,430

2793
00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:46,789
to be safe i want my head yeah yeah just
if you feel nice let's see if they

2794
00:58:46,789 --> 00:58:46,799
if you feel nice let's see if they
 

2795
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:49,109
if you feel nice let's see if they
target you the enderman because you look

2796
00:58:49,109 --> 00:58:49,119
target you the enderman because you look
 

2797
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:50,630
target you the enderman because you look
at them too often

2798
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:50,640
at them too often
 

2799
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,950
at them too often
then we will use the

2800
00:58:52,950 --> 00:58:52,960
then we will use the
 

2801
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,870
then we will use the
the pumpkin helmet if

2802
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:54,880
the pumpkin helmet if
 

2803
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:57,589
the pumpkin helmet if
does that make them stop targeting you

2804
00:58:57,589 --> 00:58:57,599
does that make them stop targeting you
 

2805
00:58:57,599 --> 00:58:59,349
does that make them stop targeting you
yeah yeah they will like you can look at

2806
00:58:59,349 --> 00:58:59,359
yeah yeah they will like you can look at
 

2807
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:01,670
yeah yeah they will like you can look at

ah
where is the next path that i built

3764
01:17:51,110 --> 01:17:51,120

 

3765
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:53,430

so you know in the

3766
01:17:53,430 --> 01:17:53,440
so you know in the
 

3767
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:55,030
so you know in the
basically it's like a [\h__\h] ton of

3768
01:17:55,030 --> 01:17:55,040
basically it's like a [\h__\h] ton of
 

3769
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:58,790
basically it's like a [\h__\h] ton of
islands in the end and they are uh

3770
01:17:58,790 --> 01:17:58,800
islands in the end and they are uh
 

3771
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:01,110
islands in the end and they are uh
mostly not connected so we will have to

3772
01:18:01,110 --> 01:18:01,120
mostly not connected so we will have to
 

3773
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:02,870
mostly not connected so we will have to
build the paths this is a path that i i

3774
01:18:02,870 --> 01:18:02,880
build the paths this is a path that i i
 

3775
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:05,030
build the paths this is a path that i i
guess i built before

3776
01:18:05,030 --> 01:18:05,040
guess i built before
 

3777
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:08,070
guess i built before
uh oh while we're at it um

well i'm going to take a screenshot of
that

4242
01:26:42,870 --> 01:26:42,880
that
 

4243
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:45,510
that
i guess we can go over there

4244
01:26:45,510 --> 01:26:45,520
i guess we can go over there
 

4245
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:46,709
i guess we can go over there
um

um
 

4247
01:26:46,719 --> 01:26:48,229
um
the end is the same as the

4248
01:26:48,229 --> 01:26:48,239
the end is the same as the
 

4249
01:26:48,239 --> 01:26:50,149
the end is the same as the
updates change how chunks load the first

4250
01:26:50,149 --> 01:26:50,159
updates change how chunks load the first
 

4251
01:26:50,159 --> 01:26:52,390
updates change how chunks load the first
time but that's still seed based old

4252
01:26:52,390 --> 01:26:52,400
time but that's still seed based old
 

4253
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:56,149
time but that's still seed based old
chunks don't change interesting

4254

chunks don't change interesting
 

4255
01:26:56,159 --> 01:26:57,669
chunks don't change interesting
i guess it's kind of like the same thing

01:43:46,790 --> 01:43:46,800
should we try and get more blocks from
 

5157
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:47,990
should we try and get more blocks from
here

5158
01:43:47,990 --> 01:43:48,000
here
 

5159
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,830
here

5169
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:05,830

a few more blocks yeah i don't see a

5170
01:44:05,830 --> 01:44:05,840
a few more blocks yeah i don't see a
 

5171
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:08,149
a few more blocks yeah i don't see a
bridge either but yeah that that's why

5172
01:44:08,149 --> 01:44:08,159
bridge either but yeah that that's why
 

5173
01:44:08,159 --> 01:44:10,229
bridge either but yeah that that's why
it could be myself cause i just flew

5174
01:44:10,229 --> 01:44:10,239
it could be myself cause i just flew
 

5175
01:44:10,239 --> 01:44:12,709
it could be myself cause i just flew
onto those islands rather than bridging

5176
01:44:12,709 --> 01:44:12,719
onto those islands rather than bridging
 

5177
01:44:12,719 --> 01:44:15,669
onto those islands rather than bridging
oh yeah you can fly now so i guess

5178
01:44:15,669 --> 01:44:15,679
oh yeah you can fly now so i guess
 

5179
01:44:15,679 --> 01:44:18,070
oh yeah you can fly now so i guess
yeah it's it's a bit dangerous so people

5180
01:44:18,070 --> 01:44:18,080
yeah it's it's a bit dangerous so people
 

5181
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:19,590
yeah it's it's a bit dangerous so people
don't recommend it so i did it off

5182
01:44:19,590 --> 01:44:19,600
don't recommend it so i did it off
 

5183
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:20,550
don't recommend it so i did it off
stream

5184
01:44:20,550 --> 01:44:20,560
stream
 

5185
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:22,310
stream
oh

5186
01:44:22,310 --> 01:44:22,320
oh
 

5187
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:24,149
oh
we'll always go like

5188
01:44:24,149 --> 01:44:24,159
we'll always go like
 

5189
01:44:24,159 --> 01:44:27,830
we'll always go like
no kiana is dangerous don't fly in the

5190
01:44:27,830 --> 01:44:27,840
no kiana is dangerous don't fly in the
 

5191
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:28,950
no kiana is dangerous don't fly in the
end

5192
01:44:28,950 --> 01:44:28,960
end
 

5193
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:31,910
end
no

5194
01:44:31,910 --> 01:44:31,920

 

5195
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:35,109

i see i can see how it might be risky

5196
01:44:35,109 --> 01:44:35,119
i see i can see how it might be risky
 

5197
01:44:35,119 --> 01:44:35,910
i see i can see how it might be risky
yeah

5198
01:44:35,910 --> 01:44:35,920
yeah
 

5199
01:44:35,920 --> 01:44:38,310
yeah
it is because like it loads in so slowly

5200
01:44:38,310 --> 01:44:38,320
it is because like it loads in so slowly
 

5201
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:40,149
it is because like it loads in so slowly
while you're flying so quickly and you

5202
01:44:40,149 --> 01:44:40,159
while you're flying so quickly and you
 

5203
01:44:40,159 --> 01:44:42,310
while you're flying so quickly and you
might bump into something and die

5204
01:44:42,310 --> 01:44:42,320
might bump into something and die
 

5205
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:44,470
might bump into something and die
yeah and fireworks i mean i wonder how

5206
01:44:44,470 --> 01:44:44,480
yeah and fireworks i mean i wonder how
 

5207
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:46,310
yeah and fireworks i mean i wonder how
the flying thing works with like control

5208
01:44:46,310 --> 01:44:46,320
the flying thing works with like control
 

5209
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:48,070
the flying thing works with like control
and stuff like that is it hard to

5210
01:44:48,070 --> 01:44:48,080
and stuff like that is it hard to
 

5211
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:49,990
and stuff like that is it hard to
control where you're flying

5212
01:44:49,990 --> 01:44:50,000
control where you're flying
 

5213
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,310
control where you're flying
it's pretty easy to control but the

5214
01:44:52,310 --> 01:44:52,320
it's pretty easy to control but the
 

5215
01:44:52,320 --> 01:44:53,910
it's pretty easy to control but the
thing is like most of the time when you

5216
01:44:53,910 --> 01:44:53,920
thing is like most of the time when you
 

5217
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:57,270
thing is like most of the time when you
fly everything loads in slower than you

5218
01:44:57,270 --> 01:44:57,280
fly everything loads in slower than you
 

5219
01:44:57,280 --> 01:44:59,189
fly everything loads in slower than you
fly so

5220
01:44:59,189 --> 01:44:59,199
fly so
 

5221
01:44:59,199 --> 01:45:01,910
fly so
you might end up flying into a huge

5222
01:45:01,910 --> 01:45:01,920
you might end up flying into a huge
 

5223
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:05,910
you might end up flying into a huge
mountain and it kills you oh

5224
01:45:05,910 --> 01:45:05,920
mountain and it kills you oh
 

5225
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:07,030
mountain and it kills you oh
which uh

5226
01:45:07,030 --> 01:45:07,040
which uh
 

5227
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:09,189
which uh
might have happened before

01:45:09,189 --> 01:45:09,199
might have happened before
 

5229
01:45:09,199 --> 01:45:12,229
might have happened before
i take that as it has happened before

5230
01:45:12,229 --> 01:45:12,239
i take that as it has happened before
 

5231

they know how to get one if they want to

7368
02:30:02,630 --> 02:30:02,640
they know how to get one if they want to
 

7369
02:30:02,640 --> 02:30:05,429
they know how to get one if they want to
know sure absolutely how long can you

7370
02:30:05,429 --> 02:30:05,439
know sure absolutely how long can you
 

7371
02:30:05,439 --> 02:30:07,910
know sure absolutely how long can you
fly with one firework by the way

7372
02:30:07,910 --> 02:30:07,920
fly with one firework by the way
 

7373
02:30:07,920 --> 02:30:10,309
fly with one firework by the way
um so there's uh three different

7374
02:30:10,309 --> 02:30:10,319
um so there's uh three different
 

7375
02:30:10,319 --> 02:30:12,150
um so there's uh three different
strengths of fireworks the one that i

7376
02:30:12,150 --> 02:30:12,160
strengths of fireworks the one that i
 

7377
02:30:12,160 --> 02:30:14,070
strengths of fireworks the one that i
gave you is the one that i always use

7378
02:30:14,070 --> 02:30:14,080
gave you is the one that i always use
 

7379
02:30:14,080 --> 02:30:16,230
gave you is the one that i always use
it's the weakest one but

7380
02:30:16,230 --> 02:30:16,240
it's the weakest one but
 

7381
02:30:16,240 --> 02:30:18,389
it's the weakest one but
i think and most people would agree with

7382
02:30:18,389 --> 02:30:18,399
i think and most people would agree with
 

7383
02:30:18,399 --> 02:30:21,270
i think and most people would agree with
me that that one is good enough

7384
02:30:21,270 --> 02:30:21,280
me that that one is good enough
 

7385
02:30:21,280 --> 02:30:24,150
me that that one is good enough
um so with that one

7386
02:30:24,150 --> 02:30:24,160
um so with that one
 

7387
02:30:24,160 --> 02:30:26,870
um so with that one

you get like a small boost and then you
can just glide until you

7390
02:30:29,190 --> 02:30:29,200
can just glide until you
 

7391
02:30:29,200 --> 02:30:31,190
can just glide until you
completely lose the

02:30:31,190 --> 02:30:31,200
