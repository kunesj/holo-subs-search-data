like I was thinking with like oh maybe
 

255
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,530
like I was thinking with like oh maybe
we should restrict this restrict that

256
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:00,540
we should restrict this restrict that
 

257
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,870
we should restrict this restrict that
but I feel like Terra still lies is like

258
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:02,880
but I feel like Terra still lies is like
 

259
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,449
but I feel like Terra still lies is like
the gimmick of the game anyways and we

260
00:14:05,449 --> 00:14:05,459
the gimmick of the game anyways and we
 

261
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:08,030
the gimmick of the game anyways and we
like a little bit of chaos if not a lot

262
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:08,040
like a little bit of chaos if not a lot
 

263
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:12,170
like a little bit of chaos if not a lot
of chaos so I guess surprise let's go

264
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:12,180
of chaos so I guess surprise let's go
 

265
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:16,129

267
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:19,370
surprise we need gimmick yeah YouTuber
okay okay and then any health items also

268
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:19,380

269
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,370
okay okay and then any health items also
okay yeah guys so yeah uh for real guys

270
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:22,380

271
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,310
okay yeah guys so yeah uh for real guys
any hailed items okay for real and no

272
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:25,320
any hailed items okay for real and no
 

273
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,710
any hailed items okay for real and no
but no abilities that affect the

274
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:27,720
but no abilities that affect the
 

275
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,110

opponent BP negatively you wouldn't want

276
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:30,120
opponent BP negatively you wouldn't want
 

277
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,889
opponent BP negatively you wouldn't want
your PP to be affected negatively right

278
00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:33,899
your PP to be affected negatively right
 

279
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:37,490
your PP to be affected negatively right
so PP is like uh your metronome you only

280
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:37,500
so PP is like uh your metronome you only
 

281
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,710
so PP is like uh your metronome you only
have limited amounts of uses and then

282
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:39,720
have limited amounts of uses and then
 

283
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,290
have limited amounts of uses and then
once your PP Runs Out you will start to

284
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:42,300
once your PP Runs Out you will start to
 

285
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,930
once your PP Runs Out you will start to
use struggle which is a move that hurts

286
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:44,940
use struggle which is a move that hurts
 

287
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,449
use struggle which is a move that hurts
your opponent Pokemon a little bit but

288
00:14:47,449 --> 00:14:47,459
your opponent Pokemon a little bit but
 

289
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:50,509
your opponent Pokemon a little bit but
also endures you quiet you know so it's

290
00:14:50,509 --> 00:14:50,519
also endures you quiet you know so it's
 

291
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:53,269
also endures you quiet you know so it's
like yeah no pressure no pressure guys

292
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:53,279
like yeah no pressure no pressure guys
 

293
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,389
like yeah no pressure no pressure guys
this is a no pressured tournament and

294
00:14:56,389 --> 00:14:56,399
this is a no pressured tournament and
 

295
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,790
this is a no pressured tournament and
then maybe it's enough yeah people

296
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:58,800
then maybe it's enough yeah people
 

297
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,310
then maybe it's enough yeah people
enough and then you can use items to

298
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:01,320
enough and then you can use items to
 

299
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,189
enough and then you can use items to
raise your PP at your Pokemon when

300
00:15:04,189 --> 00:15:04,199

301
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:06,710
raise your PP at your Pokemon when
preparing and you can use PP up but from

302
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:06,720
preparing and you can use PP up but from
 

303
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,110
preparing and you can use PP up but from
my experience with the demo battle yeah

304
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:09,120
my experience with the demo battle yeah
 

305
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,389
my experience with the demo battle yeah
we don't really need it I think but you

306
00:15:11,389 --> 00:15:11,399
we don't really need it I think but you
 

307
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:15,310
we don't really need it I think but you
can anyways yeah yeah

308
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:15,320
can anyways yeah yeah
 

309
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,650
can anyways yeah yeah
and then we can do Max one Paradox no

310
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:18,660
and then we can do Max one Paradox no
 

311
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:22,189
and then we can do Max one Paradox no
mythical legendary well why because it's

312
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:22,199
mythical legendary well why because it's
 

313
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:23,329
mythical legendary well why because it's
up to you whether you want to use

314
00:15:23,329 --> 00:15:23,339
up to you whether you want to use
 

315
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,189
up to you whether you want to use
Paradox or not even though no mythical

316
00:15:25,189 --> 00:15:25,199
Paradox or not even though no mythical
 

317
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,710
Paradox or not even though no mythical
legendary but I feel like the Paradox

318
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:27,720
legendary but I feel like the Paradox
 

319
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,410
legendary but I feel like the Paradox
Pokemon is like the you know the main

320
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:30,420
Pokemon is like the you know the main
 

321
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,810

thing of this Pokemon and I think it

322
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:32,820
