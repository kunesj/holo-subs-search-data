all right but it seems like you all have
 

2093
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:32,569
all right but it seems like you all have
the answer good job wow I I don't even

2094
01:00:32,569 --> 01:00:32,579
the answer good job wow I I don't even
 

2095
01:00:32,579 --> 01:00:34,250
the answer good job wow I I don't even
want to try it

2096
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:34,260
want to try it
 

2097
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:37,849
want to try it
I'm solving it

2098
01:00:37,849 --> 01:00:37,859

 

2099
01:00:37,859 --> 01:00:40,730

um
with the 10 out of 12 on the top left

2106
01:00:45,829 --> 01:00:45,839
with the 10 out of 12 on the top left
 

2107
01:00:45,839 --> 01:00:47,089
with the 10 out of 12 on the top left
doesn't mean there's only 10

01:00:47,089 --> 01:00:47,099
doesn't mean there's only 10
 

2109
01:00:47,099 --> 01:00:49,430
doesn't mean there's only 10
participants left or is it the 10th uh

2111
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:52,490
participants left or is it the 10th uh
thingy to solve out of 12 like two more

2112
01:00:52,490 --> 01:00:52,500
thingy to solve out of 12 like two more
 

2113
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:56,809
thingy to solve out of 12 like two more
left or what

I didn't expect this to take so much
time when I give them the infinite time

2130
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:17,460
time when I give them the infinite time
 

2131
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:18,950
time when I give them the infinite time
but okay

2132
01:01:18,950 --> 01:01:18,960

like a little bit more of a quiet type
so

4496
02:10:31,129 --> 02:10:31,139
so
 

4497
02:10:31,139 --> 02:10:33,290
