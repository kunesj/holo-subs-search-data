we'll go ahead and take a look at what

1196
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:19,080
we'll go ahead and take a look at what
 

1197
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,070
we'll go ahead and take a look at what
you guys did cuz I have no clue what

so yesterday I started alone for 30

1208
00:33:34,629 --> 00:33:34,639
so yesterday I started alone for 30
 

1209
00:33:34,639 --> 00:33:36,909
so yesterday I started alone for 30
minutes and that created some chaos I

1210
00:33:36,909 --> 00:33:36,919
minutes and that created some chaos I
 

1211
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:39,269
minutes and that created some chaos I
unfortunately had to explode some things

1212
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:39,279
unfortunately had to explode some things
 

1213
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,710
unfortunately had to explode some things
because creepers were everywhere in the

1214
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:41,720
because creepers were everywhere in the
 

1215
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:46,750
because creepers were everywhere in the
beginning um and that resulted in some

1216
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:46,760
beginning um and that resulted in some
 

1217
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,389
beginning um and that resulted in some
issues here you may have noticed the

1218
00:33:48,389 --> 00:33:48,399
issues here you may have noticed the
 

1219
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:50,310
issues here you may have noticed the
merchants and so on are gone yeah

1220
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:50,320
merchants and so on are gone yeah
 

1221
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,830
merchants and so on are gone yeah
they're all super dead yeah they were

1222
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:52,840
they're all super dead yeah they were
 

1223
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,590
they're all super dead yeah they were
eaten by zombies and this is a big

1224
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:55,600
eaten by zombies and this is a big
 

1225
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,430
eaten by zombies and this is a big
problem because we need

1226
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:58,440
problem because we need
 

1227
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,909
problem because we need
Merchants villagers again villagers true

1228
00:34:01,909 --> 00:34:01,919
Merchants villagers again villagers true
 

1229
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,230
Merchants villagers again villagers true
so but the thing is like they spawned

1230
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:04,240
so but the thing is like they spawned
 

1231
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,109
so but the thing is like they spawned
only in specific phases so our job

1232
00:34:08,109 --> 00:34:08,119
only in specific phases so our job
 

1233
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:10,589
only in specific phases so our job
yesterday was we were in Phase seven and

1234
00:34:10,589 --> 00:34:10,599
yesterday was we were in Phase seven and
 

1235
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:13,430
yesterday was we were in Phase seven and
there were 10 so we were mining for

1236
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:13,440
there were 10 so we were mining for
 

1237
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,230
there were 10 so we were mining for
hours those last three phases took a

1238
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:16,240
hours those last three phases took a
 

1239
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,909
hours those last three phases took a
while um so that we can Circle back but

1240
00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:18,919
while um so that we can Circle back but
 

1241
00:34:18,919 --> 00:34:20,550
while um so that we can Circle back but
turns out it doesn't Circle back it's

1242
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:20,560
turns out it doesn't Circle back it's
 

1243
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,389
turns out it doesn't Circle back it's
just like after 10 phases it gives you

1244
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:23,399
just like after 10 phases it gives you
 

1245
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:27,389
just like after 10 phases it gives you
all phases at once so the pool of blocks

1246
00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:27,399
all phases at once so the pool of blocks
 

1247
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:31,030
all phases at once so the pool of blocks
and things you can get from mining now

1248
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:31,040
and things you can get from mining now
 

1249
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,270
and things you can get from mining now
is way bigger than in a single phase you

1250
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:33,280
is way bigger than in a single phase you
 

1251
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,829
is way bigger than in a single phase you
know what I mean cuz it's All Phases

1252
00:34:34,829 --> 00:34:34,839
know what I mean cuz it's All Phases
 

1253
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:37,710
know what I mean cuz it's All Phases
combined yeah so the chances of us

1254
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:37,720
combined yeah so the chances of us
 

1255
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,270
combined yeah so the chances of us
getting what we really want is lower now

1256
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:40,280
getting what we really want is lower now
 

1257
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,669
getting what we really want is lower now
but at the same time we can get

1258
00:34:41,669 --> 00:34:41,679
but at the same time we can get
 

1259
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,790
but at the same time we can get
everything okay at once yeah that's

1260
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:44,800
everything okay at once yeah that's
 

1261
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,349
everything okay at once yeah that's
chaotic as hell yeah and then uh we

1262
00:34:48,349 --> 00:34:48,359
chaotic as hell yeah and then uh we
 

1263
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:49,869
chaotic as hell yeah and then uh we
noticed

1264
00:34:49,869 --> 00:34:49,879
noticed
 

1265
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,430
noticed
um

1266
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:51,440
um
 

1267
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,349
um
some uh things uh that could be improved

1268
00:34:55,349 --> 00:34:55,359
some uh things uh that could be improved
 

1269
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,829
some uh things uh that could be improved
here this is still the mining area this

1270
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:57,839
here this is still the mining area this
 

1271
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,030
here this is still the mining area this
this block here in between the chocolate

1272
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:00,040
this block here in between the chocolate
 

1273
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:03,270
this block here in between the chocolate
blocks is the one you mine uh I'm going

1274
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:03,280
blocks is the one you mine uh I'm going
 

1275
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,390
blocks is the one you mine uh I'm going
to build like something where uh it goes

1276
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:07,400
to build like something where uh it goes
 

1277
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,190
to build like something where uh it goes
immediately into a chest here through

1278
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:09,200
immediately into a chest here through
 

1279
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,750
immediately into a chest here through
the water so our what was the actual

1280
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:12,760
the water so our what was the actual
 

1281
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,310
the water so our what was the actual
purpose I think

1282
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:14,320
purpose I think
 

1283
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,870
purpose I think
because our inventories were always full

1284
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:16,880
because our inventories were always full
 

1285
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,829
because our inventories were always full
I don't know I don't know anymore but

1286
00:35:18,829 --> 00:35:18,839
I don't know I don't know anymore but
 

1287
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:20,470
I don't know I don't know anymore but
yeah now it's looking really chocolatey

1288
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:20,480
yeah now it's looking really chocolatey
 

1289
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,430
yeah now it's looking really chocolatey
and nice and then you can like click on

1290
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:22,440
and nice and then you can like click on
 

1291
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,270
and nice and then you can like click on
the chest here on the side and like

1292
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:24,280
the chest here on the side and like
 

1293
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,349
the chest here on the side and like
there's more to sort For You O exciting

1294
00:35:27,349 --> 00:35:27,359
there's more to sort For You O exciting
 

1295
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,589
there's more to sort For You O exciting
so the there's a lot in there cool I

1296
00:35:30,589 --> 00:35:30,599
so the there's a lot in there cool I
 

1297
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:32,349
so the there's a lot in there cool I
don't even know how do people even get

1298
00:35:32,349 --> 00:35:32,359
don't even know how do people even get
 

1299
00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:35,109
don't even know how do people even get
the mechanism that's crazy I don't oh

1300
00:35:35,109 --> 00:35:35,119
the mechanism that's crazy I don't oh
 

1301
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,630
the mechanism that's crazy I don't oh
she worked on a while on it yeah wow and

1302
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:37,640
she worked on a while on it yeah wow and
 

1303
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,790
she worked on a while on it yeah wow and
then besides this contraption we have

1304
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:39,800
then besides this contraption we have
 

1305
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,790
then besides this contraption we have
another new one I saw you already were

1306
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:41,800
another new one I saw you already were
 

1307
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,470
another new one I saw you already were
standing here but didn't notice what it

1308
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:44,480
standing here but didn't notice what it
 

1309
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,870
standing here but didn't notice what it
was what is this this is a cobblestone

1310
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:47,880
was what is this this is a cobblestone
 

1311
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,550
was what is this this is a cobblestone
generator that uh Gooby created

1312
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:50,560
generator that uh Gooby created
 

1313
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,910
generator that uh Gooby created
surprisingly she made it wow basically I

1314
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:54,920
surprisingly she made it wow basically I
 

1315
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,670
surprisingly she made it wow basically I
think maybe you know that stone in

1316
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:56,680
think maybe you know that stone in
 

1317
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,109
think maybe you know that stone in
between the lava and the water you mine

1318
00:35:59,109 --> 00:35:59,119
between the lava and the water you mine
 

1319
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:02,069
between the lava and the water you mine
that and you get endless Cobblestone

1320
00:36:02,069 --> 00:36:02,079
that and you get endless Cobblestone
 

1321
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:04,150
that and you get endless Cobblestone
trying okay I think I can actually see

1322
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:04,160
trying okay I think I can actually see

paths or whatever this is maybe a good
 

1335
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,270
paths or whatever this is maybe a good
option and then there's some extra

1336
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:23,280
option and then there's some extra
 

1337

that's most efficient app we don't even
 

1403
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,430
that's most efficient app we don't even
have that much space you see it's

1404
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:53,440
have that much space you see it's
 

1405
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,750
have that much space you see it's
already pretty cramped if we can get

1406
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:55,760
already pretty cramped if we can get
 

1407
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,750
already pretty cramped if we can get
this uh area stand it yeah that would be

1408
00:37:59,750 --> 00:37:59,760
this uh area stand it yeah that would be
 

1409
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,710
this uh area stand it yeah that would be
fine but we don't have that many dirt

1410
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:01,720
fine but we don't have that many dirt
 

1411
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,430
fine but we don't have that many dirt
blocks either I wish we could generate

1412
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:04,440
blocks either I wish we could generate
 

1413
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:08,270
blocks either I wish we could generate
dirt blocks yeah oh see there's grass

1414

going a few yeah maybe I can go find
 

1417
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,670
going a few yeah maybe I can go find
some dirt blocks around here and replace

1418
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:14,680
some dirt blocks around here and replace
 

1419

it's okay I don't even think this takes
 

1421
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:21,829
it's okay I don't even think this takes
priority um I think uh the Sorting for

01:01:45,470 --> 01:01:45,480
that's just mining at that block over
 

2441
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:47,630
that's just mining at that block over
there but don't worry about mining right

01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:50,309
there but don't worry about mining right
now yeah cuz now like there's how many

2444
01:01:50,309 --> 01:01:50,319
now yeah cuz now like there's how many
 

2445
01:01:50,319 --> 01:01:52,349
now yeah cuz now like there's how many
blocks is it that you could get out of

2446
01:01:52,349 --> 01:01:52,359
blocks is it that you could get out of
 

2447
01:01:52,359 --> 01:01:54,470
blocks is it that you could get out of
that it's the 10 phases combined so it's

2448
01:01:54,470 --> 01:01:54,480
that it's the 10 phases combined so it's
 

2449
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:57,109
that it's the 10 phases combined so it's
like everything so the chance to get

2450
01:01:57,109 --> 01:01:57,119
like everything so the chance to get
 

2451
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:59,829
like everything so the chance to get
diamonds is pretty low now that is true

2452

about it oh shouldn't they have done a

6846
02:48:14,790 --> 02:48:14,800
about it oh shouldn't they have done a
 

6847
02:48:14,800 --> 02:48:16,590
about it oh shouldn't they have done a
gajillion different

checks they they always do and like it

6850
02:48:19,429 --> 02:48:19,439
checks they they always do and like it
 

6851
02:48:19,439 --> 02:48:21,429
checks they they always do and like it
was supposed to be super secure but you

6852
02:48:21,429 --> 02:48:21,439
was supposed to be super secure but you
 

6853
02:48:21,439 --> 02:48:23,389
was supposed to be super secure but you
know and then the question was are they

6854
02:48:23,389 --> 02:48:23,399
know and then the question was are they
 

6855
02:48:23,399 --> 02:48:25,510
know and then the question was are they
going to rebuild it or not because like

6856
02:48:25,510 --> 02:48:25,520
going to rebuild it or not because like
 

6857
02:48:25,520 --> 02:48:26,990
going to rebuild it or not because like
this should never happen again it was

6858
02:48:26,990 --> 02:48:27,000
this should never happen again it was
 

6859

kind of ridiculous in the first place
 

6861
02:48:29,240 --> 02:48:30,950
kind of ridiculous in the first place
and so they decided to not rebuild it

6862
02:48:30,950 --> 02:48:30,960
and so they decided to not rebuild it
 

6863
02:48:30,960 --> 02:48:33,070
and so they decided to not rebuild it
and that's the right choice because how

6864
02:48:33,070 --> 02:48:33,080
and that's the right choice because how
 

6865
02:48:33,080 --> 02:48:35,429
and that's the right choice because how
