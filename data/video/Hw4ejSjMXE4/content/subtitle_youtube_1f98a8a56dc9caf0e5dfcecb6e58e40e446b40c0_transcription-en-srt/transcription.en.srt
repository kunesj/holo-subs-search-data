219
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:37,730

uh yeah I think those were the free

220
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:37,740
uh yeah I think those were the free
 

221
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,930
uh yeah I think those were the free
things oh so and the good thing about it

222
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:41,940
things oh so and the good thing about it
 

223
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:45,230
things oh so and the good thing about it
is that supposedly it isn't the same as

224
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:45,240
is that supposedly it isn't the same as
 

225
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,990
is that supposedly it isn't the same as
an oven

226

an oven
 

227
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,870
an oven
yeah but it's kind of faster because the

228
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:50,880
yeah but it's kind of faster because the
 

229
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,730
yeah but it's kind of faster because the
size of the Empire I don't know it's

I'm trying to Big Brain here

234
00:10:58,970 --> 00:10:58,980
I'm trying to Big Brain here
 

235
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,150
I'm trying to Big Brain here
um it contains the heat better

236
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:02,160
um it contains the heat better
 

237
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,509
um it contains the heat better
um and it gets uh hotter faster I think

238
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:05,519
um and it gets uh hotter faster I think
 

239
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,810
um and it gets uh hotter faster I think
and the biggest thing about it is that

240
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:08,820
and the biggest thing about it is that
 

241
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:12,230
and the biggest thing about it is that
you use less oil let's say you're making

242
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:12,240
you use less oil let's say you're making
 

243
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,269
you use less oil let's say you're making
fried chicken

244
00:11:14,269 --> 00:11:14,279
fried chicken
 

245
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:17,690
fried chicken
um in the pan in a lot of hot frying oil

246
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:17,700
um in the pan in a lot of hot frying oil
 

247
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,050
um in the pan in a lot of hot frying oil
you're gonna use so much oil but the

248
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:21,060
you're gonna use so much oil but the
 

249
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,889
you're gonna use so much oil but the
airfryer needs only a little Spritz of

250
00:11:24,889 --> 00:11:24,899
airfryer needs only a little Spritz of
 

251
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:27,590
airfryer needs only a little Spritz of
oil yeah

252
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:27,600
oil yeah
 

253
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,050
oil yeah
um so ideally you would get yourself

254
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:30,060
um so ideally you would get yourself
 

255
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:33,710
um so ideally you would get yourself
like one of those oil

256
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:33,720
like one of those oil
 

257
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,190
like one of those oil
um spray fingers I couldn't find any

258
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:37,200
um spray fingers I couldn't find any
 

259
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,769
um spray fingers I couldn't find any
though so I

260
00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:39,779
though so I
 

261
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:42,650
though so I
this is not gonna work well but it's the

262
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:42,660
this is not gonna work well but it's the
 

263
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,710
this is not gonna work well but it's the
best I could fight

264
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:44,720
best I could fight
 

265
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,829
best I could fight
I got a

266
00:11:48,829 --> 00:11:48,839
I got a
 

267
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:50,630
I got a
a simple

268
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:50,640
a simple
 

269
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,790
a simple
um flower

270
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:51,800
um flower
 

271
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:57,590
um flower
spraying thingy with one tiny tiny hole

272
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:57,600
spraying thingy with one tiny tiny hole
 

273
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,730
spraying thingy with one tiny tiny hole
there

274
00:11:58,730 --> 00:11:58,740
there
 

275
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,250
there
um I tested it and it does not work well

276
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:01,260
um I tested it and it does not work well
 

277
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,410
um I tested it and it does not work well
at all

278
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:03,420
at all
 

279
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:08,090
at all
but it's better than what I did before

280
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:08,100
but it's better than what I did before
 

281
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,269
but it's better than what I did before
um before I just tried my best to like I

282
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:11,279
um before I just tried my best to like I
 

283
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,730
um before I just tried my best to like I
don't know dab everything in oil a

284
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:13,740
don't know dab everything in oil a
 

285
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,410
don't know dab everything in oil a
little bit and I still felt that

286
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:15,420
little bit and I still felt that
 

287
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,810
little bit and I still felt that
actually works well for me really I

288
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:17,820
actually works well for me really I
 

289
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,750
actually works well for me really I
think if I would use the proper

290
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:20,760
think if I would use the proper
 

291
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:25,190
think if I would use the proper
um oil frying device uh or oil spraying

292
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:25,200
um oil frying device uh or oil spraying
 

293
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,750
um oil frying device uh or oil spraying
device

294
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:26,760
device
 

295
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,650
device
um then I would have

296
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:29,660
um then I would have
 

297
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:32,410
um then I would have
less oil

298
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:32,420
less oil
 

299
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,509
less oil
uh

300
00:12:34,509 --> 00:12:34,519
uh
 

301
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:38,750
uh
spread over a bigger surface nicely

302
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:38,760
spread over a bigger surface nicely
 

303
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,569
spread over a bigger surface nicely
evenly this will not be very even that's

304
00:12:41,569 --> 00:12:41,579
evenly this will not be very even that's
 

305
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:44,750
evenly this will not be very even that's
my problem like I tried and it's just if

306
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:44,760
my problem like I tried and it's just if
 

307
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,610

309
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,190
it has a missed scrub it doesn't that's
the problem I need that it just comes up

310
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:49,200
the problem I need that it just comes up
 

311
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,230

370
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:10,740
would have been like somewhere else so I
 

371
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,769
would have been like somewhere else so I
wanted to go somewhere somewhat close

372
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:12,779

watched several similar recipes trivia I

422
00:15:32,329 --> 00:15:32,339
watched several similar recipes trivia I
 

423
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:34,090
watched several similar recipes trivia I
watched several similar recipes

424
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:34,100
watched several similar recipes
 

425
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:39,370
watched several similar recipes
and they are all say different degrees

426
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:39,380
and they are all say different degrees
 

427
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,410
and they are all say different degrees
but like

428
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:41,420
but like
 

429
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:46,910
but like
roughly I guess like 100 degrees Celsius

430
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:46,920
roughly I guess like 100 degrees Celsius
 

431
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,790
roughly I guess like 100 degrees Celsius
to 150 degrees Celsius maybe I don't

432
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:49,800
to 150 degrees Celsius maybe I don't
 

433
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,449
to 150 degrees Celsius maybe I don't
know

434
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:50,459
know
 

435
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:53,030
know
I don't know no manual sounding no there

436
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,040
I don't know no manual sounding no there
 

437
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,490
I don't know no manual sounding no there
is but I don't know how much I would do

438
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:55,500
is but I don't know how much I would do
 

439
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,470
is but I don't know how much I would do
so

440
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:57,480
so
 

441
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,350
so
um maybe more than definitely more than

442
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:00,360
um maybe more than definitely more than
 

443
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,509
um maybe more than definitely more than
100 I guess one but one recipe she was

444
