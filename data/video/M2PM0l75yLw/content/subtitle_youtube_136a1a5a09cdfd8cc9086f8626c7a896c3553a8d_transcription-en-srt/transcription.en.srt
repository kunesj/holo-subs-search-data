say which ones they
are yeah but I think in 3D this would

3550
01:41:41,669 --> 01:41:41,679
are yeah but I think in 3D this would
 

3551
01:41:41,679 --> 01:41:43,629
are yeah but I think in 3D this would
work better overall somebody could even

now for some
reason more more

12177
05:27:32,150 --> 05:27:32,160
reason more more
 

12178
05:27:32,160 --> 05:27:34,350

order something to deliver then it's

16058
07:15:20,788 --> 07:15:20,798

worse than if you ate it at the actual
 

16063

07:38:52,190 --> 07:38:52,200
if you manage to handle that you might
 

16879
07:38:52,200 --> 07:38:55,070
if you manage to handle that you might
actually be able to handle skydiving no

16880
07:38:55,070 --> 07:38:55,080
actually be able to handle skydiving no
 

16881
07:38:55,080 --> 07:38:57,990
actually be able to handle skydiving no
that's way more scary from my experience

16882
07:38:57,990 --> 07:38:58,000
that's way more scary from my experience
 

16883
07:38:58,000 --> 07:39:00,070
that's way more scary from my experience
skydiving was surprisingly less scary

16884
07:39:00,070 --> 07:39:00,080
skydiving was surprisingly less scary
 

16885
07:39:00,080 --> 07:39:02,308
skydiving was surprisingly less scary
than I expected because when you're more

16886
07:39:02,308 --> 07:39:02,318
than I expected because when you're more
 

16887
07:39:02,318 --> 07:39:04,350
than I expected because when you're more
than 3,000 ft above the ground your

16888
07:39:04,350 --> 07:39:04,360
than 3,000 ft above the ground your
 

16889
07:39:04,360 --> 07:39:06,270
than 3,000 ft above the ground your
brain is trouble really acknowledging

16890
07:39:06,270 --> 07:39:06,280
brain is trouble really acknowledging
 

16891
07:39:06,280 --> 07:39:10,150
brain is trouble really acknowledging
how high up you

16892
07:39:10,150 --> 07:39:10,160

 

16893
07:39:10,160 --> 07:39:14,948

are I don't know about that e but does

16894
07:39:14,948 --> 07:39:14,958
are I don't know about that e but does
 

16895
07:39:14,958 --> 07:39:17,628
are I don't know about that e but does
that mean you tried it

16896
07:39:17,628 --> 07:39:17,638
that mean you tried it
 

16897
07:39:17,638 --> 07:39:20,150
that mean you tried it
so I

16898
07:39:20,150 --> 07:39:20,160

no looking at the ground so far below
 

16903
07:39:27,920 --> 07:39:29,468
no looking at the ground so far below
almost just looked like it was a picture

16904
07:39:29,468 --> 07:39:29,478
almost just looked like it was a picture
 

16905
07:39:29,478 --> 07:39:31,308
almost just looked like it was a picture
rather than a distance I could fall and

16906
07:39:31,308 --> 07:39:31,318
rather than a distance I could fall and
 

16907
07:39:31,318 --> 07:39:33,548
rather than a distance I could fall and
get hurt from I understand that it may

get hurt from I understand that it may
 

16909
07:39:33,558 --> 07:39:36,430
get hurt from I understand that it may
not look like much anymore but my brain

16910
07:39:36,430 --> 07:39:36,440
not look like much anymore but my brain
 

16911
07:39:36,440 --> 07:39:42,030
not look like much anymore but my brain
would still know I'm in a

16912
07:39:42,030 --> 07:39:42,040

 

16913
07:39:42,040 --> 07:39:47,788

07:39:51,270 --> 07:39:51,280
flying with someone else strapped to me
 

16919
07:39:51,280 --> 07:39:53,388
flying with someone else strapped to me

that at least makes it a lot better in
 

16925
07:40:01,798 --> 07:40:07,910
that at least makes it a lot better in
my brain um as long as I'm strapped to

16926
07:40:07,910 --> 07:40:07,920
