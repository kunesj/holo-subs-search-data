that's okay cuz we fought eh a 9k won

7088
04:05:26,750 --> 04:05:26,760
that's okay cuz we fought eh a 9k won
 

7089
04:05:26,760 --> 04:05:30,110
that's okay cuz we fought eh a 9k won
before and wasn't our maximum 40K

7090
04:05:30,110 --> 04:05:30,120
before and wasn't our maximum 40K
 

7091
04:05:30,120 --> 04:05:33,910
before and wasn't our maximum 40K
before so if it goes by how much higher

7092
04:05:33,910 --> 04:05:33,920
before so if it goes by how much higher
 

7093
04:05:33,920 --> 04:05:36,469
before so if it goes by how much higher
it is than my own then it must be over

7094
04:05:36,469 --> 04:05:36,479
it is than my own then it must be over
 

7095
04:05:36,479 --> 04:05:38,950
it is than my own then it must be over
50,000 or so because we saw the HP on

7096
04:05:38,950 --> 04:05:38,960
50,000 or so because we saw the HP on
 

7097
04:05:38,960 --> 04:05:41,630
50,000 or so because we saw the HP on
the 40,000 one

7098
04:05:41,630 --> 04:05:41,640
the 40,000 one
 

7099
04:05:41,640 --> 04:05:44,429
the 40,000 one
right so it would have to be over that

7100
04:05:44,429 --> 04:05:44,439
right so it would have to be over that
