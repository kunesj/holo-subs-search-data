01:01:38,569 --> 01:01:38,579
like
 

2381
01:01:38,579 --> 01:01:42,890
like
I my mom was not planning on entering

2382
01:01:42,890 --> 01:01:42,900
I my mom was not planning on entering
 

2383
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:45,710
I my mom was not planning on entering
she did not really want to enter

2384
01:01:45,710 --> 01:01:45,720
she did not really want to enter
 

2385
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:48,530
she did not really want to enter
and so I was just like okay I guess

2386
01:01:48,530 --> 01:01:48,540
and so I was just like okay I guess
 

2387
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:50,329
and so I was just like okay I guess
we're not entering also because the

2388
01:01:50,329 --> 01:01:50,339
we're not entering also because the
 

2389
01:01:50,339 --> 01:01:52,849
we're not entering also because the
tickets were I mean we did not even

2390
01:01:52,849 --> 01:01:52,859
tickets were I mean we did not even
 

2391
01:01:52,859 --> 01:01:55,250
tickets were I mean we did not even
check but we just I guess assumed that

2392
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:55,260
check but we just I guess assumed that
 

2393
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:58,609
check but we just I guess assumed that
they would be online only and sold out

2394
01:01:58,609 --> 01:01:58,619
they would be online only and sold out
 

2395
01:01:58,619 --> 01:02:03,049
they would be online only and sold out
in advance which seems to be true though

2396
01:02:03,049 --> 01:02:03,059
in advance which seems to be true though
 

2397
01:02:03,059 --> 01:02:05,690

01:05:29,059 --> 01:05:34,010
these bigger holes
I didn't know

2526
01:05:34,010 --> 01:05:34,020

 

2527
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:36,950

you have these all around the Colosseum

2528
01:05:36,950 --> 01:05:36,960
you have these all around the Colosseum
 

2529
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:39,950
you have these all around the Colosseum
and

2530
01:05:39,950 --> 01:05:39,960
and
 

2531
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:43,309
and
we actually eventually found out what

2532
01:05:43,309 --> 01:05:43,319
we actually eventually found out what
 

2533
01:05:43,319 --> 01:05:45,230
we actually eventually found out what
those were

2534
01:05:45,230 --> 01:05:45,240
those were
 

2535
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:48,049
those were
and it was a very surprising interesting

2536
01:05:48,049 --> 01:05:48,059
and it was a very surprising interesting
 

2537
01:05:48,059 --> 01:05:49,970
and it was a very surprising interesting
reason because like we were like what

2538
01:05:49,970 --> 01:05:49,980
reason because like we were like what
 

2539
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:52,370
reason because like we were like what
makes these holes like it's at weird

2540
01:05:52,370 --> 01:05:52,380
makes these holes like it's at weird
 

2541
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:54,470
makes these holes like it's at weird
spots so it's not like they could just

2542
01:05:54,470 --> 01:05:54,480
spots so it's not like they could just
 

2543
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,809
spots so it's not like they could just
fall out there right because you look at

2544
01:05:56,809 --> 01:05:56,819
fall out there right because you look at
 

2545
01:05:56,819 --> 01:05:59,210
fall out there right because you look at
the placement of the holes

2546
01:05:59,210 --> 01:05:59,220
the placement of the holes
 

2547
01:05:59,220 --> 01:06:00,470
the placement of the holes
um and then I was wondering maybe like

2548
01:06:00,470 --> 01:06:00,480
um and then I was wondering maybe like
 

2549
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:03,170
um and then I was wondering maybe like
it was shot with like small Bombs all

2550
01:06:03,170 --> 01:06:03,180
it was shot with like small Bombs all
 

2551
01:06:03,180 --> 01:06:06,890
it was shot with like small Bombs all
over but no so a tour guide ended up

2552
01:06:06,890 --> 01:06:06,900
over but no so a tour guide ended up
 

2553
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:08,510
over but no so a tour guide ended up
telling us

2554
01:06:08,510 --> 01:06:08,520
telling us
 

2555
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:10,970
telling us
that in all those holes

2556
01:06:10,970 --> 01:06:10,980
that in all those holes
 

2557
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:13,309
that in all those holes
that was originally

2558
01:06:13,309 --> 01:06:13,319
that was originally
 

2559
01:06:13,319 --> 01:06:14,109
that was originally
um

2560
01:06:14,109 --> 01:06:14,119
um
 

2561
01:06:14,119 --> 01:06:17,690
um
I think bronze

2562
01:06:17,690 --> 01:06:17,700
I think bronze
 

2563
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:20,630
I think bronze
I think it was bronze or gold no it was

2564
01:06:20,630 --> 01:06:20,640
I think it was bronze or gold no it was
 

2565
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:22,190
I think it was bronze or gold no it was
probably bronze

2566
01:06:22,190 --> 01:06:22,200
probably bronze
 

2567
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:24,770
probably bronze
or Woods or wait there was there were

2568
01:06:24,770 --> 01:06:24,780
or Woods or wait there was there were
 

2569
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:27,190
or Woods or wait there was there were
several materials that were mentioned

2570
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:27,200
several materials that were mentioned
 

2571
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:31,329
several materials that were mentioned
in a connection to a lot of

2572
01:06:31,329 --> 01:06:31,339
in a connection to a lot of

material that many many many many
 

2579
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:45,770
material that many many many many
hundreds years uh thousands years ago

that
uh but also originally in order to even

2626
01:07:49,549 --> 01:07:49,559
uh but also originally in order to even
 

2627
01:07:49,559 --> 01:07:51,049
uh but also originally in order to even
build this

2628

build this
 

2629
01:07:51,059 --> 01:07:53,690

uh I'm I'm I'm free feature is the

2660
01:08:41,689 --> 01:08:41,699
uh I'm I'm I'm free feature is the
 

2661
01:08:41,699 --> 01:08:44,570
uh I'm I'm I'm free feature is the
actual uh

2662
01:08:44,570 --> 01:08:44,580
actual uh
 

2663
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:47,329

uh name yeah
 

2665
01:08:47,339 --> 01:08:52,849
uh name yeah
and it was built in eight years

2666
01:08:52,849 --> 01:08:52,859
and it was built in eight years
 

2667
01:08:52,859 --> 01:08:53,930
and it was built in eight years
I think

2668
01:08:53,930 --> 01:08:53,940
I think
 

2669
01:08:53,940 --> 01:08:57,229
I think
really fast because

2670
01:08:57,229 --> 01:08:57,239
really fast because
 

2671
01:08:57,239 --> 01:09:00,590
really fast because
um you know it looks it's obviously huge

2672
01:09:00,590 --> 01:09:00,600
um you know it looks it's obviously huge
 

2673
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:01,669
um you know it looks it's obviously huge
yeah

2674
01:09:01,669 --> 01:09:01,679
yeah
 

2675
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:04,729
yeah
and looks like it would take ages to

2676
01:09:04,729 --> 01:09:04,739
and looks like it would take ages to
 

2677
01:09:04,739 --> 01:09:05,809
and looks like it would take ages to
build

2678
01:09:05,809 --> 01:09:05,819
build
 

2679
01:09:05,819 --> 01:09:07,309
build
but

2680
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:07,319
but
 

2681
01:09:07,319 --> 01:09:09,829
but
the thing is that it's like very let me

2682
01:09:09,829 --> 01:09:09,839
the thing is that it's like very let me
 

2683
01:09:09,839 --> 01:09:12,709
the thing is that it's like very let me
go back to I guess like this picture

2684
01:09:12,709 --> 01:09:12,719
go back to I guess like this picture
 

2685
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:15,530
go back to I guess like this picture
the thing is it's very repetitive

2686
01:09:15,530 --> 01:09:15,540
the thing is it's very repetitive
 

2687
01:09:15,540 --> 01:09:19,729
the thing is it's very repetitive
you have the same arches all over again

2688
01:09:19,729 --> 01:09:19,739
you have the same arches all over again
 

2689
01:09:19,739 --> 01:09:21,530
you have the same arches all over again
so

2690
01:09:21,530 --> 01:09:21,540
so
 

2691
01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:23,030
so
um the people who were building it

2692
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:23,040
um the people who were building it
 

2693

01:20:57,420 --> 01:20:59,649
really to
nothing that points it out specifically

3244
01:20:59,649 --> 01:20:59,659
nothing that points it out specifically
