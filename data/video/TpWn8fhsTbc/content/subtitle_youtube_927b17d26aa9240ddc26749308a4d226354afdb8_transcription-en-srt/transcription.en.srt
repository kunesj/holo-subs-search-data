you might need all those different
 

959
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,470
you might need all those different
brushes not because they do one thing

some parts of your face yeah I think so
too cuz if I don't use powder first of

1330
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:29,520
too cuz if I don't use powder first of
 

1331
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,750
too cuz if I don't use powder first of
all every time I touch my face I'll have

1332
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:31,760
all every time I touch my face I'll have
 

1333
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,430
all every time I touch my face I'll have
makeup on my fingers so I can't and then

1334
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:35,440
makeup on my fingers so I can't and then
 

1335
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,109
makeup on my fingers so I can't and then
if I don't use powder then I'll

1336
00:35:37,109 --> 00:35:37,119
if I don't use powder then I'll
 

1337
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:39,910
if I don't use powder then I'll
definitely have more like lines because

1338
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:39,920
definitely have more like lines because
 

1339
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,710
definitely have more like lines because
just because the the the makeup is not

1340
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:41,720
just because the the the makeup is not
 

1341
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:45,390
just because the the the makeup is not
set in place also I think generally it

1342
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:45,400
set in place also I think generally it
 

1343
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,190
set in place also I think generally it
like overall gives it a more Blended

1344
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:48,200
like overall gives it a more Blended
 

1345
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,430
like overall gives it a more Blended

people like you said you be it becomes

4006
01:36:31,189 --> 01:36:31,199
people like you said you be it becomes
 

4007
01:36:31,199 --> 01:36:32,950
people like you said you be it becomes
overs saturated but also people become

4008
01:36:32,950 --> 01:36:32,960
overs saturated but also people become
 

4009
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:35,669
overs saturated but also people become
like desensitized and stop seeing they

4010
01:36:35,669 --> 01:36:35,679
like desensitized and stop seeing they
 

4011
01:36:35,679 --> 01:36:38,590
like desensitized and stop seeing they
stop seeing it as like real events and

4012
01:36:38,590 --> 01:36:38,600
stop seeing it as like real events and
 

4013
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:41,510
stop seeing it as like real events and
it becomes like entertainment like it it

4014
01:36:41,510 --> 01:36:41,520
it becomes like entertainment like it it
 

4015
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:43,270
it becomes like entertainment like it it
it's just like reading a book or so I

4016
01:36:43,270 --> 01:36:43,280
it's just like reading a book or so I
 

4017
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:45,709
it's just like reading a book or so I
guess then it becomes interesting story

4018
01:36:45,709 --> 01:36:45,719
guess then it becomes interesting story
 

4019
01:36:45,719 --> 01:36:47,470
guess then it becomes interesting story
but more exciting because it's real

4020
01:36:47,470 --> 01:36:47,480
but more exciting because it's real
 

4021
01:36:47,480 --> 01:36:48,950
but more exciting because it's real
which is I think when it gets to that

4022
01:36:48,950 --> 01:36:48,960
which is I think when it gets to that
 

4023
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:51,229
which is I think when it gets to that
point you need to step back like that's

4024
01:36:51,229 --> 01:36:51,239
point you need to step back like that's
 

4025
01:36:51,239 --> 01:36:54,149
point you need to step back like that's
also because these stories that M the

4026
01:36:54,149 --> 01:36:54,159
also because these stories that M the
 

4027
01:36:54,159 --> 01:36:55,669
also because these stories that M the
true crime stories are usually like

4028
01:36:55,669 --> 01:36:55,679
true crime stories are usually like
 

4029
01:36:55,679 --> 01:36:58,229
true crime stories are usually like
really [\h__\h] up ones that and that's

4030
01:36:58,229 --> 01:36:58,239
really [\h__\h] up ones that and that's
 

4031
01:36:58,239 --> 01:37:01,709
really [\h__\h] up ones that and that's
exactly why you feel like your brain

4032
01:37:01,709 --> 01:37:01,719
exactly why you feel like your brain
 

4033
01:37:01,719 --> 01:37:04,629
exactly why you feel like your brain
thinks oh that that is so unrealistic

4034
01:37:04,629 --> 01:37:04,639
thinks oh that that is so unrealistic
 

4035

that it doesn't seem like a real story
 

4037
01:37:06,679 --> 01:37:09,189
that it doesn't seem like a real story
because it's so [\h__\h] up so it's more

4067
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:53,669
a bit I think is another draw like oh
this is how this happened well I'm going

4068
01:37:53,669 --> 01:37:53,679
this is how this happened well I'm going
 

4069
01:37:53,679 --> 01:37:56,629
this is how this happened well I'm going
to be wary of this oh like all this so

4070
01:37:56,629 --> 01:37:56,639
to be wary of this oh like all this so
 

4071

01:38:02,149 --> 01:38:02,159
but also of course it depends like what
 

4075
01:38:02,159 --> 01:38:03,950
but also of course it depends like what
what the cases

4076
01:38:03,950 --> 01:38:03,960
what the cases
 

4077
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:07,189

so maybe it's a phase thing I think it

4314
01:43:22,750 --> 01:43:22,760
so maybe it's a phase thing I think it
 

4315
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:25,310
so maybe it's a phase thing I think it
is a common phase to go through I think

4316
01:43:25,310 --> 01:43:25,320
is a common phase to go through I think
 

4317
01:43:25,320 --> 01:43:26,990
is a common phase to go through I think
like and I don't think it's just a girl

4318
01:43:26,990 --> 01:43:27,000
like and I don't think it's just a girl
 

4319
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:28,350
like and I don't think it's just a girl
thing maybe it's girls that are more

4320
01:43:28,350 --> 01:43:28,360
thing maybe it's girls that are more
 

4321
01:43:28,360 --> 01:43:31,750
thing maybe it's girls that are more
likely to get super down the rabbit hole

4322
01:43:31,750 --> 01:43:31,760
likely to get super down the rabbit hole
 

4323
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:34,750
likely to get super down the rabbit hole
but I think boys and girls both have

4324
01:43:34,750 --> 01:43:34,760
but I think boys and girls both have
 

4325
01:43:34,760 --> 01:43:36,550
but I think boys and girls both have
that cuz it's I think it starts with

4326
01:43:36,550 --> 01:43:36,560
that cuz it's I think it starts with
 

4327
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:39,589
that cuz it's I think it starts with
morbid curiosity and just wanting to

4328
01:43:39,589 --> 01:43:39,599
morbid curiosity and just wanting to
 

4329
01:43:39,599 --> 01:43:42,270
morbid curiosity and just wanting to
understand how and why why that's the

4330
01:43:42,270 --> 01:43:42,280
understand how and why why that's the
 

4331
01:43:42,280 --> 01:43:44,030
understand how and why why that's the
biggest question I think I usually have

4332
01:43:44,030 --> 01:43:44,040
biggest question I think I usually have
 

4333
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:45,790
biggest question I think I usually have
is why the [\h__\h] would you do that what's

01:43:45,790 --> 01:43:45,800
is why the [\h__\h] would you do that what's
 

4335
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:47,910
is why the [\h__\h] would you do that what's
wrong with your brain to do such things

4336
01:43:47,910 --> 01:43:47,920
wrong with your brain to do such things
 

4337
