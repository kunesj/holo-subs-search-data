it's a pretty
 

125
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,070
it's a pretty
obvious answer to me who we're gonna be

126
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,080

130
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:43,039
um
 

131
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,230
um
so that's that

132
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:46,240

 

133
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,110

oh that's such a premiere okay uh yeah

134
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:49,120
oh that's such a premiere okay uh yeah
 

135
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,749
oh that's such a premiere okay uh yeah
anyway so i know who will be fighting i

136
00:05:51,749 --> 00:05:51,759
anyway so i know who will be fighting i
 

137
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,749
anyway so i know who will be fighting i
will be muting this out now it's

138
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:53,759

142
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:58,800
so we'll do that and i suppose that will
 

143
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,390
so we'll do that and i suppose that will
be the ending uh for us

144
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:02,400
be the ending uh for us
 

145
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,710
