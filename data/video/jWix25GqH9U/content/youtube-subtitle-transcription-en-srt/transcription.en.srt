that's pretty strong yeah but I lived in
 

313
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,230
that's pretty strong yeah but I lived in
Japan for 3 years and like I don't think

314
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:17,240
Japan for 3 years and like I don't think
 

315
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,430
Japan for 3 years and like I don't think
I've cuz I I never got alerts on my

316
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:19,440
I've cuz I I never got alerts on my
 

317
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,910
I've cuz I I never got alerts on my
phone and I've been told seemingly if

318
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:21,920
phone and I've been told seemingly if
 

319
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,829
phone and I've been told seemingly if
the I think if the source of the

320
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:23,839
the I think if the source of the
 

321
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,870
the I think if the source of the
earthquake is pretty far from

322
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:26,880
earthquake is pretty far from
 

323
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,470
earthquake is pretty far from
you like so that it's like really far

324
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:29,480
you like so that it's like really far
 

325
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,069
you like so that it's like really far
like maybe even different prefecture

326
00:11:32,069 --> 00:11:32,079
like maybe even different prefecture
 

327
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,509
like maybe even different prefecture
then I guess uh it seems like you may

328
00:11:34,509 --> 00:11:34,519
then I guess uh it seems like you may
 

329
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:36,590
then I guess uh it seems like you may
not get the notification but this time

330
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:36,600
not get the notification but this time
 

331
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,550
not get the notification but this time
the source was closer I guess so I got a

332
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:39,560
the source was closer I guess so I got a
 

333
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,430
the source was closer I guess so I got a
