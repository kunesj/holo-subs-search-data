them in the settings uh on the on the
 

575
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,669
them in the settings uh on the on the
computer here there's a scientist who

576
00:19:33,669 --> 00:19:33,679
computer here there's a scientist who
 

577
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,950
computer here there's a scientist who
can access a portable vitals panel so

578
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:35,960
can access a portable vitals panel so
 

579
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,470
can access a portable vitals panel so
they can check at any point of time if

that
 

601
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,909
that
dies is that how it works the first

602
00:20:02,909 --> 00:20:02,919
dies is that how it works the first
 

603
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:04,590
dies is that how it works the first
person that dies yeah something like

604
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:04,600

temporarily shield and protect other
living crew mates oh so I guess if

612
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:12,520
living crew mates oh so I guess if
 

613
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,029
living crew mates oh so I guess if
you're the first one that dies you

become the guardian angel and then you
 

617
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,390
become the guardian angel and then you
can protect somebody else so that they

618
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:18,400
can protect somebody else so that they

00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:22,440
don't die yeah if you do it properly and
 

621
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,870
don't die yeah if you do it properly and
well timed you'll be able to prevent

622
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:23,880
well timed you'll be able to prevent
 

623
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,350
well timed you'll be able to prevent
imposters from killing their victim

624
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:25,360
imposters from killing their victim
 

625
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,830

vented to wherever it is from
 

1451
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,750
vented to wherever it is from
Communications oh does anyone know where

1452
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:23,760
Communications oh does anyone know where
 

1453
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,309
Communications oh does anyone know where
where the vents from Communications

1454
00:41:25,309 --> 00:41:25,319
where the vents from Communications
 

1455
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:26,790
where the vents from Communications
connect they go anywhere

1456
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:26,800
connect they go anywhere
 

1457
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,230
