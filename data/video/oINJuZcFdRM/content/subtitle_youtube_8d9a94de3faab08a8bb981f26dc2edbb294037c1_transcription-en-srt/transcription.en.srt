touching up i think we got to figure out

900
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:43,760
touching up i think we got to figure out
 

901
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,149
touching up i think we got to figure out
the uh frequency thingy first

902
00:24:46,149 --> 00:24:46,159
the uh frequency thingy first
 

903
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:47,990
the uh frequency thingy first
okay let's hold on guys i'm gonna fix

904
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:48,000
okay let's hold on guys i'm gonna fix
 

905
00:24:48,000 --> 00:25:06,390
okay let's hold on guys i'm gonna fix
something really quick

what was that i saw something on the i

918
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:36,960
what was that i saw something on the i
 

919
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,350
what was that i saw something on the i
have

920
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:37,360
have
 

921
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,909
have
acquired another wheel where are you

922
00:25:39,909 --> 00:25:39,919
acquired another wheel where are you
 

923
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,510
acquired another wheel where are you
finding all these oils

924
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:41,520
finding all these oils
 

925
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:47,269
finding all these oils
on top of the roof oh

926
00:25:47,269 --> 00:25:47,279

 

927
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,269

this one's red so maybe that goes into

928
00:25:49,269 --> 00:25:49,279
this one's red so maybe that goes into
 

929
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,710
this one's red so maybe that goes into
the door inside

930
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:50,720
the door inside
 

931
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,390
the door inside
oh yeah i could think that i saw prompt

932
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:54,400
oh yeah i could think that i saw prompt
 

933
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,870
oh yeah i could think that i saw prompt
on the wall

is this stuff
oh coordinates oh we can't mess around

946
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:13,039
oh coordinates oh we can't mess around
 

947
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,029
oh coordinates oh we can't mess around
with any of this stuff yet

948
00:26:15,029 --> 00:26:15,039
with any of this stuff yet
 

949
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,470
with any of this stuff yet
oh but we have coordinates

950
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:18,480
oh but we have coordinates
 

951
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,990
oh but we have coordinates
47 45 what was it 40 yeah

952
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:22,000
47 45 what was it 40 yeah
 

953

00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:41,760
back up to the roof and fix it okay
 

965
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,430
back up to the roof and fix it okay
yes i know it's like it's probably

966
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:43,440
yes i know it's like it's probably
 

967
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,470
yes i know it's like it's probably
better once we get to a different

968
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:44,480
better once we get to a different
 

969
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,870
better once we get to a different
section of the game

970
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:46,880
section of the game
 

971
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,029
section of the game
actually seems better when i'm outside

972
00:26:49,029 --> 00:26:49,039
actually seems better when i'm outside
 

973
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,269
actually seems better when i'm outside
for some reason

974
00:26:51,269 --> 00:26:51,279
for some reason
 

975
00:26:51,279 --> 00:27:02,870
for some reason
the like isn't as bad

all right so uh i don't know if we're

982
00:27:13,029 --> 00:27:13,039
all right so uh i don't know if we're
 

983
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,149
all right so uh i don't know if we're
maybe we're supposed to match the

984
00:27:14,149 --> 00:27:14,159
maybe we're supposed to match the
 

985
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:15,750
maybe we're supposed to match the
frequencies or something

986
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:15,760
frequencies or something
 

987
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,430
frequencies or something
let's try yeah hold on i hear him i

988
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:19,440
let's try yeah hold on i hear him i
 

989

00:27:27,029 --> 00:27:27,039
only says out there
 

995
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,190
only says out there
like a robot try to speed up the

996

like a robot try to speed up the
 

997
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,310
like a robot try to speed up the

oh uh okay try to make the frequency
like longer i guess

1010

like longer i guess
 

1011
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,470

on the other side but let's do the
 

1217
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,310
on the other side but let's do the
coordinates thing first because i feel

1223
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:36,550

okay all right i'm in the coordinates

1224
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:36,560

of the coordinates to me
 

1231
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:48,389

okay okay wait um

1327
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,430
let's let's see what the next one is
uh delta 195. okay i don't think we need

1328
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:21,440
uh delta 195. okay i don't think we need
 

1329
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:21,990
uh delta 195. okay i don't think we need
to use the machine

1330
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:22,000
to use the machine
 

1331
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,990
to use the machine
we could just do with our eyes delta 195

1332
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:24,000
we could just do with our eyes delta 195
 

1333
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,550
we could just do with our eyes delta 195
and the second coordinate

1334
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:26,560
and the second coordinate
 

1335
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,550
and the second coordinate
that's that's uh from the bottom the

1336
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:28,560
that's that's uh from the bottom the
 

1337
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,910
that's that's uh from the bottom the
third one

1338
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:31,920

 

1339
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,470

no no 195 yeah delta 195 is from the

1340
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:36,480
no no 195 yeah delta 195 is from the
 

1341
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,750
no no 195 yeah delta 195 is from the
bottom the first one

1342
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:37,760
bottom the first one
 

1343
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,270
bottom the first one
yeah and then we have echo169

1344
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:41,280
yeah and then we have echo169
 

1345
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,910
yeah and then we have echo169
okay that is from the left the fifth one

1346
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:45,920
okay that is from the left the fifth one
 

1347
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,990
okay that is from the left the fifth one
okay i guess that's the radio tower yeah

1348
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:50,000
okay i guess that's the radio tower yeah
 

1349
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,270
okay i guess that's the radio tower yeah
that's right send signals and we have

1350
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:53,280
that's right send signals and we have
 

1351
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,589
that's right send signals and we have
baga 481 oh that's not the radio tower

1352
00:37:55,589 --> 00:37:55,599
baga 481 oh that's not the radio tower
 

1353
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,270
baga 481 oh that's not the radio tower
it's send signals

1354
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:57,280
it's send signals
 

1355
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,390
it's send signals

does this mean that they are in the

1394
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:48,480
does this mean that they are in the
 

1395
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,310
does this mean that they are in the
middle of that because they gave us

1396
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:50,320
middle of that because they gave us
 

1397
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,750
middle of that because they gave us
three coordinates

1398
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:51,760
three coordinates
 

1399
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,550
three coordinates
free places and then they that would

1400
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:54,560
free places and then they that would
 

1401
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,150
free places and then they that would
mean that they are at the ancient

1402
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:56,160
mean that they are at the ancient
 

1403
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,349
mean that they are at the ancient

structure
 

1405
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:00,310

1411
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:08,550

um i'll go to the far away fuel

1412
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:08,560
um i'll go to the far away fuel
 

1413
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,430
um i'll go to the far away fuel
thingy the levers and then you stay on

1414
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:11,440
thingy the levers and then you stay on
 

1415
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:11,829
thingy the levers and then you stay on
the one

1416
00:39:11,829 --> 00:39:11,839
the one
 

1417
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:18,310
the one
inside okay okay

1418
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:18,320

 

1419
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,430

okay so uh on the fuel levers i don't

1420
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:21,440
okay so uh on the fuel levers i don't
 

1421
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,230
okay so uh on the fuel levers i don't
know if it's fuel

1422
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:22,240
know if it's fuel
 

1423
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,390
know if it's fuel
i'm just gonna call it that there's yeah

1424
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:24,400
i'm just gonna call it that there's yeah
 

1425
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,510
i'm just gonna call it that there's yeah
uh

1426
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:25,520
uh
 

1427
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,910
uh
each thing has like a each lever has a

1428
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:27,920
each thing has like a each lever has a
 

1429
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,349
each thing has like a each lever has a
number so there's five

1430
00:39:29,349 --> 00:39:29,359
number so there's five
 

1431
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:33,190
number so there's five
seven eight four seven

1432
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:33,200
seven eight four seven
 

1433
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,829
seven eight four seven
eight uh so i guess just tell me the

1434
00:39:35,829 --> 00:39:35,839
eight uh so i guess just tell me the
 

1435
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:37,829
eight uh so i guess just tell me the
levels for it maybe

1436
00:39:37,829 --> 00:39:37,839
levels for it maybe
 

1437
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:41,670
levels for it maybe
i have minus eight minus four minus four

1438
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:41,680
i have minus eight minus four minus four
 

1439
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,790
i have minus eight minus four minus four
minus eight minus four on on the three

1440
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:44,800
minus eight minus four on on the three
 

1441
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,230
minus eight minus four on on the three
levers but on the

1442
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:46,240
levers but on the
 

1443
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,430
levers but on the
on the thingy on the big

1444
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:49,440
on the thingy on the big
 

1445
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,550
on the thingy on the big
tank that's oh that's now it's filled up

1446
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:52,560
tank that's oh that's now it's filled up
 

1447
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,030
tank that's oh that's now it's filled up
oh actually i think we had to get into

1448
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:55,040
oh actually i think we had to get into
 

1449
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,630
oh actually i think we had to get into
that green line huh

1450
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:56,640
that green line huh
 

1451
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,470
that green line huh
ah to the green point okay then low one

1452
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:00,480

 

1453
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,150

or do i have to do so i probably also

1454
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:02,160
or do i have to do so i probably also
 

1455
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:07,589
or do i have to do so i probably also
have one or something

1456
00:40:07,589 --> 00:40:07,599

 

1457
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:17,830

how is it now oh wait

1458
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:17,840

 

1459
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:22,829

[Music]

1460
00:40:22,829 --> 00:40:22,839

 

1461
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:27,990

um

1462
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:28,000

 

1463
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,910

we're still a little bit a little bit

1464
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:29,920
we're still a little bit a little bit
 

1465
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,109
we're still a little bit a little bit
above green

1466
00:40:31,109 --> 00:40:31,119
above green
 

1467
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:34,390
above green
so oh uh what were the numbers again

1468
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:34,400
so oh uh what were the numbers again
 

1469
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,950
so oh uh what were the numbers again
uh minus eight minus four minus four

1470
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:38,960
uh minus eight minus four minus four
 

1471
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,109
uh minus eight minus four minus four
but like i turned down minus four and

1472
00:40:41,109 --> 00:40:41,119
but like i turned down minus four and
 

1473
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:42,230
but like i turned down minus four and
then it went down

1474
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:42,240
then it went down
 

1475
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:46,710
then it went down
uh a little bit from nine to eight

1476
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:46,720

 

1477
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,750

but we need to go to six

1478
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:49,760
but we need to go to six
 

1479
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:58,069
but we need to go to six
all right so that's even like

1480
00:40:58,069 --> 00:40:58,079

 

1481
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:01,109

apparently math is involved so let's uh

1482
00:41:01,109 --> 00:41:01,119
apparently math is involved so let's uh
 

1483
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:05,190
apparently math is involved so let's uh
oh no wait where were you originally i

1484
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:05,200
oh no wait where were you originally i
 

1485
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,470
oh no wait where were you originally i
forgot where that place was

1486
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:06,480
forgot where that place was
 

1487
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,670
forgot where that place was
and the gates yeah over here

1488
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:09,680
and the gates yeah over here
 

1489
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,589
and the gates yeah over here
ah there okay yeah

1490
00:41:13,589 --> 00:41:13,599
ah there okay yeah
 

1491
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:17,270

1493
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:23,750

okay it's math so it

1494
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:23,760

 

1495
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,069

1501
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,630

ah okay so i think if the maximum number

1502
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:36,640
ah okay so i think if the maximum number
 

1503
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:40,630
ah okay so i think if the maximum number
is nine then maybe put like the

1504
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:40,640
is nine then maybe put like the
 

1505
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,710
is nine then maybe put like the
oh okay i see so we have to get the max

1506
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:42,720
oh okay i see so we have to get the max
 

1507
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,390
oh okay i see so we have to get the max
yeah yeah okay i get it

1508
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:44,400
yeah yeah okay i get it
 

1509
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,910

know
i'm not good at math but essentially

1522
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:06,800
i'm not good at math but essentially
 

1523
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,670
i'm not good at math but essentially
the maximum number on this one is nine

1524
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:09,680
the maximum number on this one is nine
 

1525
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,470
the maximum number on this one is nine
and so

1526
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:10,480
and so
 

1527
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,870
and so
i can only minus four twice and minus

1528
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:12,880
i can only minus four twice and minus
 

1529
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,750
i can only minus four twice and minus
eight once

1530
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:13,760
eight once
 

1531
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,190
eight once
you get what i mean excuse me the

1532
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:15,200
you get what i mean excuse me the
 

1533
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,270
you get what i mean excuse me the
detective watson isn't the maximum

1534
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:17,280
detective watson isn't the maximum
 

1535
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:17,670
detective watson isn't the maximum
number

1536
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:17,680
number
 

1537
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,430
number
actually 10 is just not written there

1538
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:19,440
actually 10 is just not written there
 

1539
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,710
actually 10 is just not written there
because they can't uh put in so many

1540
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:20,720
because they can't uh put in so many
 

1541
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:21,190

1543
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,630

yeah you're right you're right exactly

00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:22,640
yeah you're right you're right exactly
 

1545
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,630
yeah you're right you're right exactly
that's true okay and now it would be at

1546
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:24,640
that's true okay and now it would be at
 

1547
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,330
that's true okay and now it would be at

minus four then it'll be at six
 

1555
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,309

oh no wait because i think i put more

1556
00:42:32,309 --> 00:42:32,319
oh no wait because i think i put more
 

1557
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:34,150
oh no wait because i think i put more
than ten in so i think you can only see

1558
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:34,160
than ten in so i think you can only see
 

1559
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,270
than ten in so i think you can only see
ten but technically

1560
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:35,280
ten but technically
 

1561
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,870

all the other numbers that you put in
 

1563
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,349
all the other numbers that you put in
also affect it because on minus four

1564
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:39,359
also affect it because on minus four
 

1565
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:44,230
also affect it because on minus four
it goes to eight oh

1566
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:44,240
it goes to eight oh
 

1567
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,589
it goes to eight oh
and yeah because the numbers i put in

1568
00:42:45,589 --> 00:42:45,599
and yeah because the numbers i put in
 

1569
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:47,430
and yeah because the numbers i put in
right now are eight and four

1570

3434
01:39:06,790 --> 01:39:06,800
levers i guess
 

3435
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:10,070
levers i guess
yeah and eventually we

3436
01:39:10,070 --> 01:39:10,080
yeah and eventually we
 

3437
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:13,750
yeah and eventually we
we would be able to reach the yellow one

3438
01:39:13,750 --> 01:39:13,760
we would be able to reach the yellow one
 

3439
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:15,910
we would be able to reach the yellow one
yeah and then and then once the yellow

3440
01:39:15,910 --> 01:39:15,920
yeah and then and then once the yellow
 

3441
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:18,149
yeah and then and then once the yellow
lever is arranged that would open up the

3442
01:39:18,149 --> 01:39:18,159
lever is arranged that would open up the
 

3443
01:39:18,159 --> 01:39:19,750
lever is arranged that would open up the
yellow door that is next to the red

3444
01:39:19,750 --> 01:39:19,760
yellow door that is next to the red
 

3445
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:21,750
yellow door that is next to the red
lever so then i would be able to

3446
01:39:21,750 --> 01:39:21,760
lever so then i would be able to
 

3447
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:25,109

there's a star in the sun
 

4023
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:41,030
there's a star in the sun
at the bridge ah does that mean that

4024
01:55:41,030 --> 01:55:41,040
at the bridge ah does that mean that
 

4025
01:55:41,040 --> 01:55:44,709
at the bridge ah does that mean that
in this pattern we want um the sun into

4026
01:55:44,709 --> 01:55:44,719
in this pattern we want um the sun into
 

4027
01:55:44,719 --> 01:55:45,430
in this pattern we want um the sun into
the star

4028
01:55:45,430 --> 01:55:45,440
the star
 

4029
01:55:45,440 --> 01:55:48,550
the star
also at the bottom uh actually i don't

4030
01:55:48,550 --> 01:55:48,560
also at the bottom uh actually i don't
 

4031
01:55:48,560 --> 01:55:49,270
also at the bottom uh actually i don't
know

4032
01:55:49,270 --> 01:55:49,280
know
 

4033
01:55:49,280 --> 01:55:51,350
know
yeah the bridge starts off with the star

4034
01:55:51,350 --> 01:55:51,360
yeah the bridge starts off with the star
 

4035
01:55:51,360 --> 01:55:52,470
yeah the bridge starts off with the star
and because the comet

4036
01:55:52,470 --> 01:55:52,480
and because the comet
 

4037
01:55:52,480 --> 01:55:54,070
and because the comet
is on the other side i'm assuming that's

4038
01:55:54,070 --> 01:55:54,080
is on the other side i'm assuming that's
 

4039
01:55:54,080 --> 01:55:56,229
is on the other side i'm assuming that's
what's on the other side

4040
01:55:56,229 --> 01:55:56,239
what's on the other side
 

4041
01:55:56,239 --> 01:55:57,510
what's on the other side
how do you know what was on the other

4042
01:55:57,510 --> 01:55:57,520
how do you know what was on the other
 

4043
01:55:57,520 --> 01:55:59,830
how do you know what was on the other
side did you see that i'm just assuming

4044
01:55:59,830 --> 01:55:59,840
side did you see that i'm just assuming
 

4045
01:55:59,840 --> 01:56:00,950
side did you see that i'm just assuming
that that's what's on the other side

4046
01:56:00,950 --> 01:56:00,960
that that's what's on the other side
 

4047
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:03,750
that that's what's on the other side
because if you look at the diagram

4048
01:56:03,750 --> 01:56:03,760
because if you look at the diagram
 

4049
01:56:03,760 --> 01:56:06,709
because if you look at the diagram
like uh the comment starts in this

4050
01:56:06,709 --> 01:56:06,719
like uh the comment starts in this
 

4051

4053
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:11,350

oh and there's a gap in between the star

4054
01:56:11,350 --> 01:56:11,360

4055
01:56:11,360 --> 01:56:12,950
oh and there's a gap in between the star

4059
01:56:17,440 --> 01:56:21,669

we can i guess we should try to start

4060
01:56:21,669 --> 01:56:21,679
we can i guess we should try to start
 

4061
01:56:21,679 --> 01:56:24,070
we can i guess we should try to start
by trying to get the star and the sun in

4062
01:56:24,070 --> 01:56:24,080
by trying to get the star and the sun in
 

4063
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:26,830
by trying to get the star and the sun in
the right position

4064
01:56:26,830 --> 01:56:26,840
the right position
 

4065
01:56:26,840 --> 01:56:31,430
the right position
right

4066
01:56:31,430 --> 01:56:31,440

 

4067
01:56:31,440 --> 01:56:33,189

it does it's the only thing that the

4068
01:56:33,189 --> 01:56:33,199
it does it's the only thing that the
 

4069
01:56:33,199 --> 01:56:35,990
it does it's the only thing that the
lever does resetting the

01:56:35,990 --> 01:56:36,000
lever does resetting the
 

4071
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:41,030
lever does resetting the

4072
01:56:41,030 --> 01:56:41,040

 

4073
01:56:41,040 --> 01:56:42,390

all right so we know the one that works

4074
01:56:42,390 --> 01:56:42,400
all right so we know the one that works
 

4075
01:56:42,400 --> 01:56:44,870
all right so we know the one that works
the moon comes up so it goes

4076
01:56:44,870 --> 01:56:44,880
the moon comes up so it goes
 

4077
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:46,390
the moon comes up so it goes
so i guess the star and the sun are

4078
01:56:46,390 --> 01:56:46,400
so i guess the star and the sun are
 

4079
01:56:46,400 --> 01:56:48,070
so i guess the star and the sun are
already in the correct position so the

4080
01:56:48,070 --> 01:56:48,080
already in the correct position so the
 

4081
01:56:48,080 --> 01:56:49,350
already in the correct position so the
moon has to be

4082
01:56:49,350 --> 01:56:49,360
moon has to be
 

4083
01:56:49,360 --> 01:56:52,470
moon has to be
moved into a different position oh

4084
01:56:52,470 --> 01:56:52,480
moved into a different position oh
 

4085
01:56:52,480 --> 01:56:55,350
moved into a different position oh
are we just guesting then well i mean

4086
01:56:55,350 --> 01:56:55,360
are we just guesting then well i mean
 

4087
01:56:55,360 --> 01:56:55,990
are we just guesting then well i mean
it's not really

4088
01:56:55,990 --> 01:56:56,000
it's not really
 

4089
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:57,510
it's not really
guessing because it's like a process of

01:56:57,510 --> 01:56:57,520
guessing because it's like a process of
 

4091
01:56:57,520 --> 01:56:59,510
guessing because it's like a process of
elimination if the star and the sun are

4092
01:56:59,510 --> 01:56:59,520
elimination if the star and the sun are
 

4093
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:01,750

let me see if the sun disappears when

let me see if the sun disappears when
 

4097

4099
01:57:07,119 --> 01:57:10,160

okay because maybe it's supposed to be
 

4147
01:58:18,560 --> 01:58:20,149
okay because maybe it's supposed to be
like we can stand on the star one

4148
01:58:20,149 --> 01:58:20,159
like we can stand on the star one
 

4149
01:58:20,159 --> 01:58:21,910
like we can stand on the star one
because it's connected to two sides and

4150
01:58:21,910 --> 01:58:21,920
because it's connected to two sides and
 

4151
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:23,430
because it's connected to two sides and
the sun one is only connected on one

the sun one is only connected on one
 

4153
01:58:23,440 --> 01:58:25,910
the sun one is only connected on one
side so it just falls

4155
01:58:25,920 --> 01:58:27,750

we can't see yeah yeah the next one is

01:58:27,750 --> 01:58:27,760
we can't see yeah yeah the next one is
 

4157
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:29,030

4161
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:39,589

ah wait maybe while you're moving that

4162
01:58:39,589 --> 01:58:39,599
ah wait maybe while you're moving that
 

4163
01:58:39,599 --> 01:58:41,430
ah wait maybe while you're moving that
if you move the right one in the right

if you move the right one in the right
 

4165
01:58:41,440 --> 01:58:42,629
if you move the right one in the right
position it would be

4166
01:58:42,629 --> 01:58:42,639
position it would be
 

4167
01:58:42,639 --> 01:58:45,669
position it would be
connecting itself to the star bridge to

01:58:45,669 --> 01:58:45,679
connecting itself to the star bridge to
 

4169

connecting itself to the star bridge to

4171
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,149

why it's

02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:12,229
why it's
uh not falling down but like

4210
02:00:12,229 --> 02:00:12,239
uh not falling down but like
 

4211
02:00:12,239 --> 02:00:14,149
uh not falling down but like
maybe the star is in the right position

4212
02:00:14,149 --> 02:00:14,159
maybe the star is in the right position
 

4213

currently that's why it's not falling

the bridge part does not fall down

the bridge part does not fall down
 

4219
02:00:18,719 --> 02:00:20,310
the bridge part does not fall down
because the sun piece is not in the

4226
02:00:24,310 --> 02:00:24,320
i don't know why it wasn't
 

4227
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:32,390
i don't know why it wasn't
clear

4228
02:00:32,390 --> 02:00:32,400

 

4229
02:00:32,400 --> 02:00:34,229

can you move the star thing it doesn't

4230
02:00:34,229 --> 02:00:34,239
can you move the star thing it doesn't
 

4231
02:00:34,239 --> 02:00:36,390
can you move the star thing it doesn't
do anything huh when it when it's moved

4232
02:00:36,390 --> 02:00:36,400
do anything huh when it when it's moved
 

4233
02:00:36,400 --> 02:00:40,550
do anything huh when it when it's moved
i can still stand on the bridge i guess

4234
02:00:40,550 --> 02:00:40,560
i can still stand on the bridge i guess
 

4235
02:00:40,560 --> 02:00:57,109
i can still stand on the bridge i guess
i'm moving a bunch of stuff around

4236
02:00:57,109 --> 02:00:57,119

 

4237
02:00:57,119 --> 02:00:59,830

no no changes um okay i'll move this

4238
02:00:59,830 --> 02:00:59,840
no no changes um okay i'll move this
 

4239
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:02,790
no no changes um okay i'll move this
star

4240
02:01:02,790 --> 02:01:02,800

 

4241
02:01:02,800 --> 02:01:09,750

is that one not locked

4242
02:01:09,750 --> 02:01:09,760
is that one not locked
 

4243
02:01:09,760 --> 02:01:12,390
is that one not locked
the star is is locked in place no yeah

4244
02:01:12,390 --> 02:01:12,400
the star is is locked in place no yeah
 

4245
02:01:12,400 --> 02:01:14,149
the star is is locked in place no yeah
actually

4246
02:01:14,149 --> 02:01:14,159
actually
 

4247
02:01:14,159 --> 02:01:18,149
actually
okay that's why that one will never fall

4248
02:01:18,149 --> 02:01:18,159
okay that's why that one will never fall
 

4249
02:01:18,159 --> 02:01:20,310
okay that's why that one will never fall
down the first piece of the bridge so

4250
02:01:20,310 --> 02:01:20,320
down the first piece of the bridge so
 

4251
02:01:20,320 --> 02:01:22,229
down the first piece of the bridge so
the star is already in the right

4252
02:01:22,229 --> 02:01:22,239
the star is already in the right
 

4253
02:01:22,239 --> 02:01:23,860
the star is already in the right
position perhaps

4254
02:01:23,860 --> 02:01:23,870
position perhaps
 

4255
02:01:23,870 --> 02:01:26,470
position perhaps

02:01:29,830 --> 02:01:29,840
i can't maybe maybe that's
 

4259
02:01:29,840 --> 02:01:32,470
i can't maybe maybe that's
how it works could be could be wrong but

4260
02:01:32,470 --> 02:01:32,480
how it works could be could be wrong but
 

4261
02:01:32,480 --> 02:01:33,910
how it works could be could be wrong but
but

4262
02:01:33,910 --> 02:01:33,920
but
 

4263
02:01:33,920 --> 02:01:37,030
but
yeah so

4264
02:01:37,030 --> 02:01:37,040
yeah so
 

4265
02:01:37,040 --> 02:01:40,229
yeah so
so the sun

4266
02:01:40,229 --> 02:01:40,239
so the sun
 

4267
02:01:40,239 --> 02:01:43,750
so the sun
would have to be moved into every single

4268
02:01:43,750 --> 02:01:43,760
would have to be moved into every single
 

4269
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:45,270
would have to be moved into every single
position and we will find out which one

4270
02:01:45,270 --> 02:01:45,280
position and we will find out which one
 

4271
02:01:45,280 --> 02:01:48,790
position and we will find out which one
is the right one

4272
02:01:48,790 --> 02:01:48,800

 

4273
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:52,629

uh and for each each position you put it

4274
02:01:52,629 --> 02:01:52,639
uh and for each each position you put it
 

4275
02:01:52,639 --> 02:01:54,390
uh and for each each position you put it
in i have to try to stand on it to test

4276
02:01:54,390 --> 02:01:54,400
in i have to try to stand on it to test
 

4277
02:01:54,400 --> 02:01:55,830
in i have to try to stand on it to test
it out

4278
02:01:55,830 --> 02:01:55,840
it out
 

4279
02:01:55,840 --> 02:01:58,550
it out
okay okay then let's try every single

4280
02:01:58,550 --> 02:01:58,560
okay okay then let's try every single
 

4281
02:01:58,560 --> 02:01:59,109
okay okay then let's try every single
position

4282
02:01:59,109 --> 02:01:59,119
position
 

4283
02:01:59,119 --> 02:02:00,870
position
once you change it i'll stand on it let

4284
02:02:00,870 --> 02:02:00,880
once you change it i'll stand on it let
 

4285
02:02:00,880 --> 02:02:04,709
once you change it i'll stand on it let
me know i changed it

4286

does it connect

4316
02:02:42,470 --> 02:02:42,480
does it connect
 

4317
02:02:42,480 --> 02:02:45,990
does it connect
uh it's currently not connected um yeah

4318

the sun appears when the sun

4320
02:02:49,750 --> 02:02:49,760
the sun appears when the sun
 

4321
02:02:49,760 --> 02:02:51,589
the sun appears when the sun
is next to the moon but when i move the

4322
02:02:51,589 --> 02:02:51,599
is next to the moon but when i move the
 

4323
02:02:51,599 --> 02:02:53,430
is next to the moon but when i move the
moon to a different spot there's no line

4324
02:02:53,430 --> 02:02:53,440
moon to a different spot there's no line
 

4325
02:02:53,440 --> 02:02:55,430
moon to a different spot there's no line
so maybe just something else has to be

4326
02:02:55,430 --> 02:02:55,440
so maybe just something else has to be
 

4327
02:02:55,440 --> 02:03:01,830
so maybe just something else has to be
on the other side of the moon

4328
02:03:01,830 --> 02:03:01,840
on the other side of the moon
 

4329
02:03:01,840 --> 02:03:04,229
on the other side of the moon
uh not sorry if i understand the

4330
02:03:04,229 --> 02:03:04,239
uh not sorry if i understand the
 

4331
02:03:04,239 --> 02:03:05,350
uh not sorry if i understand the
sentence but what i know

4332
02:03:05,350 --> 02:03:05,360
sentence but what i know
 

4333
02:03:05,360 --> 02:03:08,790
sentence but what i know
is that um the moon piece is currently

4334
02:03:08,790 --> 02:03:08,800
is that um the moon piece is currently
 

4335
02:03:08,800 --> 02:03:11,030
is that um the moon piece is currently
not showing up because it only shows up

4336
02:03:11,030 --> 02:03:11,040
not showing up because it only shows up
 

4337
02:03:11,040 --> 02:03:13,430
not showing up because it only shows up
uh if the sun piece is in the right uh

4338
02:03:13,430 --> 02:03:13,440
uh if the sun piece is in the right uh
 

4339
02:03:13,440 --> 02:03:14,709
uh if the sun piece is in the right uh
right position

4340
02:03:14,709 --> 02:03:14,719
right position
 

4341
02:03:14,719 --> 02:03:16,790
right position
so currently i have two pieces on the

4342
02:03:16,790 --> 02:03:16,800
so currently i have two pieces on the

02:25:10,389 --> 02:25:10,399
okay absolutely no idea what this is
 

5229
02:25:10,399 --> 02:25:15,990
okay absolutely no idea what this is
i know i think i see well

5230
02:25:15,990 --> 02:25:16,000

 

5231
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:19,670

so for example ah i understand

5232
02:25:19,670 --> 02:25:19,680
so for example ah i understand
 

5233
02:25:19,680 --> 02:25:23,110
so for example ah i understand
i understand i think so

5234
02:25:23,110 --> 02:25:23,120
i understand i think so
 

5235
02:25:23,120 --> 02:25:26,230
i understand i think so
i have i have two poses right um

5236
02:25:26,230 --> 02:25:26,240
i have i have two poses right um
 

5237
02:25:26,240 --> 02:25:29,830
i have i have two poses right um
one of them has a bunch of numbers

5238
02:25:29,830 --> 02:25:29,840
one of them has a bunch of numbers
 

5239
02:25:29,840 --> 02:25:31,750
one of them has a bunch of numbers
five numbers and the other one has the

5240
02:25:31,750 --> 02:25:31,760
five numbers and the other one has the
 

5241
02:25:31,760 --> 02:25:33,190
five numbers and the other one has the
other five numbers so on the right side

5242
02:25:33,190 --> 02:25:33,200
other five numbers so on the right side
 

5243
02:25:33,200 --> 02:25:34,710
other five numbers so on the right side
i have for example one but on the other

5244
02:25:34,710 --> 02:25:34,720
i have for example one but on the other
 

5245
02:25:34,720 --> 02:25:35,990
i have for example one but on the other
poster i don't have one so

5246
02:25:35,990 --> 02:25:36,000
poster i don't have one so
 

5247
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:37,590
poster i don't have one so
we're gonna probably start with one and

5248
02:25:37,590 --> 02:25:37,600
we're gonna probably start with one and
 

5249
02:25:37,600 --> 02:25:39,429
we're gonna probably start with one and
that one is attached

5250
02:25:39,429 --> 02:25:39,439
that one is attached
 

5251
02:25:39,439 --> 02:25:42,550
that one is attached
to d2 so on my thingy here i think i

5252
02:25:42,550 --> 02:25:42,560
to d2 so on my thingy here i think i
 

5253
02:25:42,560 --> 02:25:44,469
to d2 so on my thingy here i think i
first have to do a d2

5254
02:25:44,469 --> 02:25:44,479
first have to do a d2
 

5255
02:25:44,479 --> 02:25:47,030
first have to do a d2
um i have to point like one of the

5256
02:25:47,030 --> 02:25:47,040
um i have to point like one of the
 

5257
02:25:47,040 --> 02:25:49,349
um i have to point like one of the
elements on my monitor screen thingy on

5258
02:25:49,349 --> 02:25:49,359
elements on my monitor screen thingy on
 

5259
02:25:49,359 --> 02:25:50,710
elements on my monitor screen thingy on
d2 let's try that okay

5260
02:25:50,710 --> 02:25:50,720
d2 let's try that okay
 

5261
02:25:50,720 --> 02:25:54,710
d2 let's try that okay
i have a fire on d2 yeah oh yeah okay

5262
02:25:54,710 --> 02:25:54,720
i have a fire on d2 yeah oh yeah okay
 

5263
02:25:54,720 --> 02:25:57,510
i have a fire on d2 yeah oh yeah okay
that's that's there yeah

5264
02:25:57,510 --> 02:25:57,520
that's that's there yeah
 

5265
02:25:57,520 --> 02:25:59,910
that's that's there yeah
wait so that continues number two would

5266
02:25:59,910 --> 02:25:59,920
wait so that continues number two would
 

5267
02:25:59,920 --> 02:26:01,510
wait so that continues number two would
be

5268
02:26:01,510 --> 02:26:01,520
be
 

5269
02:26:01,520 --> 02:26:05,590
be
uh a3 what's on e3

5270
02:26:05,590 --> 02:26:05,600
uh a3 what's on e3
 

5271
02:26:05,600 --> 02:26:08,790
uh a3 what's on e3
nothing right now

5272
02:26:08,790 --> 02:26:08,800

 

5273
02:26:08,800 --> 02:26:11,510

okay oh wait is that it uh you just put

5274
02:26:11,510 --> 02:26:11,520
okay oh wait is that it uh you just put
 

5275
02:26:11,520 --> 02:26:13,750
okay oh wait is that it uh you just put
a b3 down is that so simple it can

5276
02:26:13,750 --> 02:26:13,760
a b3 down is that so simple it can
 

5277
02:26:13,760 --> 02:26:16,790
a b3 down is that so simple it can
it can't be

5278
02:26:16,790 --> 02:26:16,800

 

5279
02:26:16,800 --> 02:26:20,150

okay number three is b1

5280
02:26:20,150 --> 02:26:20,160
okay number three is b1
 

5281
02:26:20,160 --> 02:26:21,429
okay number three is b1
well there must be something that you

5282
02:26:21,429 --> 02:26:21,439
well there must be something that you
 

5283
02:26:21,439 --> 02:26:26,550
well there must be something that you
have to do too b1 is already there

5284
02:26:26,550 --> 02:26:26,560

 

5285
02:26:26,560 --> 02:26:28,790

oh i don't know there's probably

5286
02:26:28,790 --> 02:26:28,800
oh i don't know there's probably
 

5287
02:26:28,800 --> 02:26:30,230
oh i don't know there's probably
something involving these books and then

5288
02:26:30,230 --> 02:26:30,240
something involving these books and then
 

5289
02:26:30,240 --> 02:26:31,190
something involving these books and then
maybe the way i can

5290
02:26:31,190 --> 02:26:31,200
maybe the way i can
 

5291
02:26:31,200 --> 02:26:34,710
maybe the way i can
uh wait that was free so

5292
02:26:34,710 --> 02:26:34,720
uh wait that was free so
 

5293
02:26:34,720 --> 02:27:00,630
uh wait that was free so
it was a three a four is there e5

5294
02:27:00,630 --> 02:27:00,640

 

5295
02:27:00,640 --> 02:27:02,790

do you have any any idea what the stuff

5296
02:27:02,790 --> 02:27:02,800
do you have any any idea what the stuff
 

5297
02:27:02,800 --> 02:27:04,870
do you have any any idea what the stuff
over at your place does

5298
02:27:04,870 --> 02:27:04,880
over at your place does
 

5299
02:27:04,880 --> 02:27:06,630
over at your place does
uh yeah so the only thing i could do is

5300
02:27:06,630 --> 02:27:06,640
uh yeah so the only thing i could do is
 

5301
02:27:06,640 --> 02:27:08,710
uh yeah so the only thing i could do is
connect between the grid that i have

5302
02:27:08,710 --> 02:27:08,720
connect between the grid that i have
 

5303
02:27:08,720 --> 02:27:10,389
connect between the grid that i have
with all the elements on it

5304
02:27:10,389 --> 02:27:10,399
with all the elements on it
 

5305
02:27:10,399 --> 02:27:12,950
with all the elements on it
and then i can't interact with them but

5306
02:27:12,950 --> 02:27:12,960
and then i can't interact with them but
 

5307
02:27:12,960 --> 02:27:14,950
and then i can't interact with them but
there's glowing circles and

5308
02:27:14,950 --> 02:27:14,960
there's glowing circles and
 

5309
02:27:14,960 --> 02:27:18,070
there's glowing circles and
arrows which uh one circle is like

5310
02:27:18,070 --> 02:27:18,080
arrows which uh one circle is like
 

5311
02:27:18,080 --> 02:27:19,670
arrows which uh one circle is like
circled around a book and then pointing

5312
02:27:19,670 --> 02:27:19,680
circled around a book and then pointing
 

5313
02:27:19,680 --> 02:27:21,429
circled around a book and then pointing
to another book that's circled with a

5314
02:27:21,429 --> 02:27:21,439
to another book that's circled with a
 

5315
02:27:21,439 --> 02:27:22,230
to another book that's circled with a
glowing

5316
02:27:22,230 --> 02:27:22,240
glowing
 

5317
02:27:22,240 --> 02:27:24,790
glowing
uh arrow so each book has different

5318
02:27:24,790 --> 02:27:24,800
uh arrow so each book has different
 

5319
02:27:24,800 --> 02:27:26,790
uh arrow so each book has different
numbers on it so one is like four

5320
02:27:26,790 --> 02:27:26,800
numbers on it so one is like four
 

5321
02:27:26,800 --> 02:27:30,230
numbers on it so one is like four
to nine oh five to one

5322
02:27:30,230 --> 02:27:30,240
to nine oh five to one
 

5323
02:27:30,240 --> 02:27:34,230
to nine oh five to one
three two two ten oh maybe it's a code

5324
02:27:34,230 --> 02:27:34,240
three two two ten oh maybe it's a code
 

5325
02:27:34,240 --> 02:27:36,950
three two two ten oh maybe it's a code
maybe like uh it's opposite so like if

5326
02:27:36,950 --> 02:27:36,960
maybe like uh it's opposite so like if
 

5327
02:27:36,960 --> 02:27:37,429
maybe like uh it's opposite so like if
if

5328
02:27:37,429 --> 02:27:37,439
if
 

5329
02:27:37,439 --> 02:27:40,550
if
on your thingy it says like a

5330
02:27:40,550 --> 02:27:40,560
on your thingy it says like a
 

5331
02:27:40,560 --> 02:27:44,710
on your thingy it says like a
a5 or something it's actually a one

5332
02:27:44,710 --> 02:27:44,720
a5 or something it's actually a one
 

5333
02:27:44,720 --> 02:27:47,830
a5 or something it's actually a one
ah you mean for example if my if my

5334
02:27:47,830 --> 02:27:47,840
ah you mean for example if my if my
 

5335
02:27:47,840 --> 02:27:49,590
ah you mean for example if my if my
number one

5336
02:27:49,590 --> 02:27:49,600
number one
 

5337
02:27:49,600 --> 02:27:53,910
number one
says d2 then on your book it says one is

5338
02:27:53,910 --> 02:27:53,920
says d2 then on your book it says one is
 

5339
02:27:53,920 --> 02:28:01,190
says d2 then on your book it says one is
with what number

5340
02:28:01,190 --> 02:28:01,200

 

5341
02:28:01,200 --> 02:28:03,190

so that would mean that the first one is

5342
02:28:03,190 --> 02:28:03,200
so that would mean that the first one is
 

5343
02:28:03,200 --> 02:28:05,110
so that would mean that the first one is
not

5344
02:28:05,110 --> 02:28:05,120
not
 

5345
02:28:05,120 --> 02:28:08,309
not
d2 but what it says here for five which

5346
02:28:08,309 --> 02:28:08,319
d2 but what it says here for five which
 

5347
02:28:08,319 --> 02:28:10,950
d2 but what it says here for five which
is c3

5348
02:28:10,950 --> 02:28:10,960
is c3
 

5349
02:28:10,960 --> 02:28:15,349
is c3
are we overthinking

5350
02:28:15,349 --> 02:28:15,359

 

5351
02:28:15,359 --> 02:28:18,389

but that actually sounds

5352
02:28:18,389 --> 02:28:18,399
but that actually sounds
 

5353
02:28:18,399 --> 02:28:20,070
but that actually sounds
i mean i can't think of what else the

5354
02:28:20,070 --> 02:28:20,080
i mean i can't think of what else the
 

5355
02:28:20,080 --> 02:28:21,830
i mean i can't think of what else the
numbers would be for but the thing is

5356
02:28:21,830 --> 02:28:21,840
numbers would be for but the thing is
 

5357
02:28:21,840 --> 02:28:23,429
numbers would be for but the thing is
like it goes all the way up to 10

5358
02:28:23,429 --> 02:28:23,439
like it goes all the way up to 10
 

5359
02:28:23,439 --> 02:28:26,790
like it goes all the way up to 10
like it says 10 is 8. uh so i don't know

5360
02:28:26,790 --> 02:28:26,800
like it says 10 is 8. uh so i don't know
 

5361
02:28:26,800 --> 02:28:27,590
like it says 10 is 8. uh so i don't know
if you have anything

5362
02:28:27,590 --> 02:28:27,600
if you have anything
 

5363
02:28:27,600 --> 02:28:29,760
if you have anything
like that like that high

5364
02:28:29,760 --> 02:28:29,770
like that like that high
 

5365
02:28:29,770 --> 02:28:32,790
like that like that high

02:28:47,590 --> 02:28:47,600
um okay let's can i reset this though
 

5371
02:28:47,600 --> 02:28:50,630
um okay let's can i reset this though
um it doesn't have to be done in a

5372
02:28:50,630 --> 02:28:50,640
um it doesn't have to be done in a
 

5373
02:28:50,640 --> 02:28:57,110
um it doesn't have to be done in a
certain order one second let's do it

5374
02:28:57,110 --> 02:28:57,120

 

5375
02:28:57,120 --> 02:28:59,670

but yours just says like one to two

5376
02:28:59,670 --> 02:28:59,680
but yours just says like one to two
 

5377
02:28:59,680 --> 02:29:01,590
but yours just says like one to two
stuff like that right in the books

5378
02:29:01,590 --> 02:29:01,600
stuff like that right in the books
 

5379
02:29:01,600 --> 02:29:04,550
stuff like that right in the books
i'll read all the books so it says uh

5380
02:29:04,550 --> 02:29:04,560
i'll read all the books so it says uh
 

5381
02:29:04,560 --> 02:29:04,950
i'll read all the books so it says uh
six

5382
02:29:04,950 --> 02:29:04,960
six
 

5383
02:29:04,960 --> 02:29:06,950
six
to seven or it's nine to seven i can't

5384

to seven or it's nine to seven i can't
 

5385
02:29:06,960 --> 02:29:08,550
to seven or it's nine to seven i can't
tell which is the right way

5386
02:29:08,550 --> 02:29:08,560
tell which is the right way
 

5387
02:29:08,560 --> 02:29:12,309
tell which is the right way
uh three to two five to one

four elements and i can decide which
 

5505

point which piece that i

5506

5507
02:32:58,080 --> 02:33:01,190

02:34:09,680 --> 02:34:10,790
it out it's just uh i feel like i don't
have enough

5560
02:34:10,790 --> 02:34:10,800
have enough
 

5561
02:34:10,800 --> 02:34:15,349
have enough
to go off of right now you know

5562
02:34:15,349 --> 02:34:15,359

 

5563
02:34:15,359 --> 02:34:17,429

and if i'm just going off of what i see

5564
02:34:17,429 --> 02:34:17,439
and if i'm just going off of what i see
 

5565
02:34:17,439 --> 02:34:18,950
and if i'm just going off of what i see
it's not really too much i can make out

5566
02:34:18,950 --> 02:34:18,960
it's not really too much i can make out
 

5567
02:34:18,960 --> 02:34:21,030
it's not really too much i can make out
aside from that it might be a code

5568
02:34:21,030 --> 02:34:21,040
aside from that it might be a code
 

5569
02:34:21,040 --> 02:34:28,230
aside from that it might be a code
and i said that's wrong

5570
02:34:28,230 --> 02:34:28,240

 

5571
02:34:28,240 --> 02:34:31,030

maybe this is one of those times where

5572
02:34:31,030 --> 02:34:31,040
maybe this is one of those times where
 

5573
02:34:31,040 --> 02:34:32,389
maybe this is one of those times where
you know kiara's gonna do something

5574
02:34:32,389 --> 02:34:32,399
you know kiara's gonna do something
 

5575
02:34:32,399 --> 02:34:36,870
you know kiara's gonna do something
first and then i've gotta do something

5576
02:34:36,870 --> 02:34:36,880

 

5577
02:34:36,880 --> 02:34:38,309

it's not like i can move the books i

5578
02:34:38,309 --> 02:34:38,319
it's not like i can move the books i
 

5579
02:34:38,319 --> 02:34:49,510
it's not like i can move the books i
can't interact with them

5580
02:34:49,510 --> 02:34:49,520

 

5581
02:34:49,520 --> 02:34:51,510

is there a way for you to reset

5582
02:34:51,510 --> 02:34:51,520
is there a way for you to reset
 

5583
02:34:51,520 --> 02:34:56,830
is there a way for you to reset
everything i did

5584
02:34:56,830 --> 02:34:56,840

 

5585
02:34:56,840 --> 02:35:04,630

no

5586
02:35:04,630 --> 02:35:04,640

 

5587
02:35:04,640 --> 02:35:08,710

you can't just take them all off um

5588
02:35:08,710 --> 02:35:08,720
you can't just take them all off um
 

5589
02:35:08,720 --> 02:35:11,670
you can't just take them all off um
i can once i placed one i can change the

5590
02:35:11,670 --> 02:35:11,680
i can once i placed one i can change the
 

5591
02:35:11,680 --> 02:35:12,150
i can once i placed one i can change the
number

5592
02:35:12,150 --> 02:35:12,160
number
 

5593
02:35:12,160 --> 02:35:16,230
number
but i don't

5594
02:35:16,230 --> 02:35:16,240

 

5595
02:35:16,240 --> 02:35:20,230

what if i place like everything oh

5596
02:35:20,230 --> 02:35:20,240
what if i place like everything oh
 

5597
02:35:20,240 --> 02:35:24,230
what if i place like everything oh
oh okay now everything's full

5598
02:35:24,230 --> 02:35:24,240
oh okay now everything's full
 

5599
02:35:24,240 --> 02:35:26,389
oh okay now everything's full
how do i get rid of them though i cannot

5600
02:35:26,389 --> 02:35:26,399
how do i get rid of them though i cannot
 

5601
02:35:26,399 --> 02:35:28,070
how do i get rid of them though i cannot
get rid of them anymore so i guess it's

5602
02:35:28,070 --> 02:35:28,080
get rid of them anymore so i guess it's
 

5603
02:35:28,080 --> 02:35:31,030
get rid of them anymore so i guess it's
okay to have extra ones on there

5604
02:35:31,030 --> 02:35:31,040
okay to have extra ones on there
 

5605
02:35:31,040 --> 02:35:34,550
okay to have extra ones on there
oh you're oh you made them disappear

5606
02:35:34,550 --> 02:35:34,560
oh you're oh you made them disappear
 

5607
02:35:34,560 --> 02:35:37,429
oh you're oh you made them disappear
how did you do that i just tried to

5608
02:35:37,429 --> 02:35:37,439
how did you do that i just tried to
 

5609
02:35:37,439 --> 02:35:51,590
how did you do that i just tried to
connect stuff

5610
02:35:51,590 --> 02:35:51,600

 

5611
02:35:51,600 --> 02:35:56,710

i'm just clicking random stuff

5612
02:35:56,710 --> 02:35:56,720

 

5613
02:35:56,720 --> 02:35:58,469

oh wait i'm sorry i figured i'd have to

5614
02:35:58,469 --> 02:35:58,479
oh wait i'm sorry i figured i'd have to
 

5615
02:35:58,479 --> 02:35:59,830
oh wait i'm sorry i figured i'd have to
remove them

5616
02:35:59,830 --> 02:35:59,840
remove them
 

5617
02:35:59,840 --> 02:36:03,590
remove them
okay

5618
02:36:03,590 --> 02:36:03,600

 

5619
02:36:03,600 --> 02:36:06,389

okay let me try to remove everything i

5620
02:36:06,389 --> 02:36:06,399
okay let me try to remove everything i
 

5621
02:36:06,399 --> 02:36:07,910
okay let me try to remove everything i
have like coordinates and stuff but

5622
02:36:07,910 --> 02:36:07,920
have like coordinates and stuff but
 

5623
02:36:07,920 --> 02:36:09,030
have like coordinates and stuff but
there's no indication of

5624
02:36:09,030 --> 02:36:09,040
there's no indication of
 

5625
02:36:09,040 --> 02:36:12,870
there's no indication of
what element should be in what um

5626
02:36:12,870 --> 02:36:12,880
what element should be in what um
 

5627
02:36:12,880 --> 02:36:15,510
what element should be in what um
i kind of seem to have it because the

5628
02:36:15,510 --> 02:36:15,520
i kind of seem to have it because the
 

5629
02:36:15,520 --> 02:36:17,830
i kind of seem to have it because the
first one starts with fire and so

5630
02:36:17,830 --> 02:36:17,840
first one starts with fire and so
 

5631
02:36:17,840 --> 02:36:19,990
first one starts with fire and so
the second one i go with green the third

5632
02:36:19,990 --> 02:36:20,000
the second one i go with green the third
 

5633
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:21,429
the second one i go with green the third
one i go over yellow the

5634
02:36:21,429 --> 02:36:21,439
one i go over yellow the
 

5635
02:36:21,439 --> 02:36:23,590
one i go over yellow the
fourth one i go with blue but i kind of

5636
02:36:23,590 --> 02:36:23,600
fourth one i go with blue but i kind of
 

5637
02:36:23,600 --> 02:36:25,270
fourth one i go with blue but i kind of
got stuck at the fourth one because the

5638
02:36:25,270 --> 02:36:25,280
got stuck at the fourth one because the
 

5639
02:36:25,280 --> 02:36:26,790
got stuck at the fourth one because the
fourth one is already set

5640
02:36:26,790 --> 02:36:26,800
fourth one is already set
 

5641
02:36:26,800 --> 02:36:29,190
fourth one is already set
in place with green even though it

5642
02:36:29,190 --> 02:36:29,200
in place with green even though it
 

5643
02:36:29,200 --> 02:36:30,790
in place with green even though it
should be blue and that's why i got

5644
02:36:30,790 --> 02:36:30,800
should be blue and that's why i got
 

5645
02:36:30,800 --> 02:36:39,429
should be blue and that's why i got
confused now

5646
02:36:39,429 --> 02:36:39,439

 

5647
02:36:39,439 --> 02:36:40,790

but i'm trying to remove them again the

5648
02:36:40,790 --> 02:36:40,800
but i'm trying to remove them again the
 

5649
02:36:40,800 --> 02:36:46,469
but i'm trying to remove them again the
ones that i just placed

5650
02:36:46,469 --> 02:36:46,479

 

5651
02:36:46,479 --> 02:36:48,950

so maybe for her coordinates since she

5652
02:36:48,950 --> 02:36:48,960
so maybe for her coordinates since she
 

5653
02:36:48,960 --> 02:36:51,990
so maybe for her coordinates since she
has like she says they go as high as 10.

5654
02:36:51,990 --> 02:36:52,000
has like she says they go as high as 10.
 

5655
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:53,590
has like she says they go as high as 10.
maybe if there's a coordinate that's 10

5656
02:36:53,590 --> 02:36:53,600
maybe if there's a coordinate that's 10
 

5657
02:36:53,600 --> 02:36:56,630
maybe if there's a coordinate that's 10
i connect it to the one that's eight

5658
02:36:56,630 --> 02:36:56,640
i connect it to the one that's eight
 

5659
02:36:56,640 --> 02:36:57,910
i connect it to the one that's eight
there's a coordinate that's i don't know

5660
02:36:57,910 --> 02:36:57,920
there's a coordinate that's i don't know
 

5661
02:36:57,920 --> 02:37:00,550
there's a coordinate that's i don't know
if this is nine or six

5662
02:37:00,550 --> 02:37:00,560
if this is nine or six
 

5663
02:37:00,560 --> 02:37:02,309
if this is nine or six
connected to seven and if there's a

5664
02:37:02,309 --> 02:37:02,319
connected to seven and if there's a
 

5665
02:37:02,319 --> 02:37:04,230
connected to seven and if there's a
coordinate that's five then i connect it

5666
02:37:04,230 --> 02:37:04,240
coordinate that's five then i connect it
 

5667
02:37:04,240 --> 02:37:10,469
coordinate that's five then i connect it
to the coordinate that's one

5668
02:37:10,469 --> 02:37:10,479

 

5669
02:37:10,479 --> 02:37:11,990

because it's not like uh sometimes with

5670
02:37:11,990 --> 02:37:12,000
because it's not like uh sometimes with
 

5671
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:13,429
because it's not like uh sometimes with
coordinates there's numbers on both

5672
02:37:13,429 --> 02:37:13,439
coordinates there's numbers on both
 

5673
02:37:13,439 --> 02:37:14,230
coordinates there's numbers on both
sides but

5674
02:37:14,230 --> 02:37:14,240
sides but
 

5675
02:37:14,240 --> 02:37:16,790
sides but
there's only numbers on one side so it

5676
02:37:16,790 --> 02:37:16,800
there's only numbers on one side so it
 

5677
02:37:16,800 --> 02:37:18,870
there's only numbers on one side so it
could correspond

5678
02:37:18,870 --> 02:37:18,880
could correspond
 

5679
02:37:18,880 --> 02:37:25,670
could correspond
okay um

5680
02:37:25,670 --> 02:37:25,680

 

5681
02:37:25,680 --> 02:37:28,550

okay everything that is on it now is uh

5682
02:37:28,550 --> 02:37:28,560
okay everything that is on it now is uh
 

5683
02:37:28,560 --> 02:37:30,230
okay everything that is on it now is uh
there from the beginning i can

5684
02:37:30,230 --> 02:37:30,240
there from the beginning i can
 

5685
02:37:30,240 --> 02:37:33,270
there from the beginning i can
not move them or i can also not change

5686
02:37:33,270 --> 02:37:33,280
not move them or i can also not change
 

5687
02:37:33,280 --> 02:37:34,389
not move them or i can also not change
the color

5688
02:37:34,389 --> 02:37:34,399
the color
 

5689
02:37:34,399 --> 02:37:37,910
the color
oh okay

5690
02:37:37,910 --> 02:37:37,920

 

5691
02:37:37,920 --> 02:37:44,150

ah can you ah

5692
02:37:44,150 --> 02:37:44,160

 

5693
02:37:44,160 --> 02:37:49,910

can you tell me

5694
02:37:49,910 --> 02:37:49,920

 

5695
02:37:49,920 --> 02:37:52,950

uh the numbers on your books again

5696
02:37:52,950 --> 02:37:52,960
uh the numbers on your books again
 

5697
02:37:52,960 --> 02:37:56,150
uh the numbers on your books again
the first ones okay

5698
02:37:56,150 --> 02:37:56,160
the first ones okay
 

5699
02:37:56,160 --> 02:38:00,389
the first ones okay
the four to six uh three to two

5700
02:38:00,389 --> 02:38:00,399
the four to six uh three to two
 

5701
02:38:00,399 --> 02:38:05,510
the four to six uh three to two
five to one ten to eight

5702
02:38:05,510 --> 02:38:05,520

 

5703
02:38:05,520 --> 02:38:11,349

four four nine to seven

5704
02:38:11,349 --> 02:38:11,359

 

5705
02:38:11,359 --> 02:38:13,830

or maybe it's four to nine and six to

5706
02:38:13,830 --> 02:38:13,840
or maybe it's four to nine and six to
 

5707
02:38:13,840 --> 02:38:20,389
or maybe it's four to nine and six to
seven

5708
02:38:20,389 --> 02:38:20,399

 

5709
02:38:20,399 --> 02:38:21,670

i guess after we figure out what we're

5710
02:38:21,670 --> 02:38:21,680
i guess after we figure out what we're
 

5711
02:38:21,680 --> 02:38:22,790
i guess after we figure out what we're
supposed to do with them then we can

5712
02:38:22,790 --> 02:38:22,800
supposed to do with them then we can
 

5713
02:38:22,800 --> 02:38:24,070
supposed to do with them then we can
test

5714
02:38:24,070 --> 02:38:24,080
test
 

5715
02:38:24,080 --> 02:38:25,590
test
if either of them are wrong we just

5716
02:38:25,590 --> 02:38:25,600
if either of them are wrong we just
 

5717
02:38:25,600 --> 02:38:31,700
if either of them are wrong we just
switch push it to

5718
02:38:31,700 --> 02:38:31,710

 

5719
02:38:31,710 --> 02:38:35,910

[Music]

5720

5721
02:38:35,920 --> 02:38:39,190

what did you say for four six right

5722
02:38:39,190 --> 02:38:39,200
what did you say for four six right
 

5723
02:38:39,200 --> 02:38:40,950
what did you say for four six right
yeah six but it could be nine because

5724
02:38:40,950 --> 02:38:40,960
yeah six but it could be nine because
 

5725
02:38:40,960 --> 02:38:42,950
yeah six but it could be nine because

5901
02:44:02,840 --> 02:44:06,309

e2

5902
02:44:06,309 --> 02:44:06,319

 

5903
02:44:06,319 --> 02:44:09,590

okay now um four to six

5904
02:44:09,590 --> 02:44:09,600
okay now um four to six
 

5905
02:44:09,600 --> 02:44:13,510
okay now um four to six
or four to nine i guess uh

5906
02:44:13,510 --> 02:44:13,520
or four to nine i guess uh
 

5907
02:44:13,520 --> 02:44:17,750
or four to nine i guess uh
four a5 to

5908
02:44:17,750 --> 02:44:17,760
four a5 to
 

5909
02:44:17,760 --> 02:44:21,590
four a5 to
a5 e e5 to a4

5910
02:44:21,590 --> 02:44:21,600
a5 e e5 to a4
 

5911
02:44:21,600 --> 02:44:24,630
a5 e e5 to a4
e5 to a4 okay so uh

5912
02:44:24,630 --> 02:44:24,640
e5 to a4 okay so uh
 

5913
02:44:24,640 --> 02:44:27,269
e5 to a4 okay so uh
both those last two i just did are blue

5914
02:44:27,269 --> 02:44:27,279
both those last two i just did are blue
 

5915
02:44:27,279 --> 02:44:28,870
both those last two i just did are blue
which means i think the elements are

5916
02:44:28,870 --> 02:44:28,880
which means i think the elements are
 

5917
02:44:28,880 --> 02:44:29,429
which means i think the elements are
correct

5918
02:44:29,429 --> 02:44:29,439
correct
 

5919
02:44:29,439 --> 02:44:32,710
correct
so i guess for the other three uh they

5920
02:44:32,710 --> 02:44:32,720
so i guess for the other three uh they
 

5921
02:44:32,720 --> 02:44:34,490
so i guess for the other three uh they
should be different elements

5922
02:44:34,490 --> 02:44:34,500
should be different elements
 

5923
02:44:34,500 --> 02:44:37,910
should be different elements

5924
02:44:37,910 --> 02:44:37,920

 

5925
02:44:37,920 --> 02:44:41,030

okay ah

5926
02:44:41,030 --> 02:44:41,040
okay ah
 

5927
02:44:41,040 --> 02:44:44,070
okay ah
ah is it perhaps

5928
02:44:44,070 --> 02:44:44,080
ah is it perhaps
 

5929
02:44:44,080 --> 02:44:46,230
ah is it perhaps
because that one is set in stone and

5930
02:44:46,230 --> 02:44:46,240
because that one is set in stone and
 

5931
02:44:46,240 --> 02:44:48,389
because that one is set in stone and
it's green

5932
02:44:48,389 --> 02:44:48,399
it's green
 

5933
02:44:48,399 --> 02:44:52,469
it's green
ah so it's opposite okay

5934
02:44:52,469 --> 02:44:52,479
ah so it's opposite okay
 

5935
02:44:52,479 --> 02:44:54,950
ah so it's opposite okay
so yeah whichever one is red then put

5936
02:44:54,950 --> 02:44:54,960
so yeah whichever one is red then put
 

5937
02:44:54,960 --> 02:44:57,269
so yeah whichever one is red then put
blue as opposite

5938
02:44:57,269 --> 02:44:57,279
blue as opposite
 

5939
02:44:57,279 --> 02:44:58,950
blue as opposite
so like for the fire one that's

5940
02:44:58,950 --> 02:44:58,960
so like for the fire one that's
 

5941
02:44:58,960 --> 02:45:00,230
so like for the fire one that's
connected to the lightning bolt just

5942
02:45:00,230 --> 02:45:00,240
connected to the lightning bolt just
 

5943
02:45:00,240 --> 02:45:04,309
connected to the lightning bolt just
turn the lightning bolt to blue

5944
02:45:04,309 --> 02:45:04,319

 

5945
02:45:04,319 --> 02:45:05,750

okay can you connect it again

5946
02:45:05,750 --> 02:45:05,760
okay can you connect it again
 

5947
02:45:05,760 --> 02:45:07,750

02:45:09,190 --> 02:45:09,200
yeah and can you connect the other one
 

5951
02:45:09,200 --> 02:45:11,190
yeah and can you connect the other one
again the

5952
02:45:11,190 --> 02:45:11,200
again the
 

5953
02:45:11,200 --> 02:45:13,830
again the
bottom left to the middle red one okay

5954
02:45:13,830 --> 02:45:13,840
bottom left to the middle red one okay
 

5955
02:45:13,840 --> 02:45:14,309
bottom left to the middle red one okay
oh yeah

5956
02:45:14,309 --> 02:45:14,319
oh yeah
 

5957
02:45:14,319 --> 02:45:17,030
oh yeah
okay because the first one started out

5958
02:45:17,030 --> 02:45:17,040
okay because the first one started out
 

5959
02:45:17,040 --> 02:45:18,150
okay because the first one started out
as green and i

5960
02:45:18,150 --> 02:45:18,160
as green and i
 

5961
02:45:18,160 --> 02:45:20,950
as green and i

the one that i set uh i can change the
 

5963
02:45:20,960 --> 02:45:23,349

5973
02:45:37,520 --> 02:45:40,630
we did it our brains are so big oh
my god okay i you know the problem was

5974
02:45:40,630 --> 02:45:40,640
my god okay i you know the problem was
 

5975
02:45:40,640 --> 02:45:42,309
my god okay i you know the problem was
in the beginning i thought that i

5976
02:45:42,309 --> 02:45:42,319
in the beginning i thought that i
 

5977
02:45:42,319 --> 02:45:44,070
in the beginning i thought that i
already had to figure out the elements

5978
02:45:44,070 --> 02:45:44,080
already had to figure out the elements
 

5979
02:45:44,080 --> 02:45:45,190
already had to figure out the elements
from the get-go

5980
02:45:45,190 --> 02:45:45,200
from the get-go
 

5981
02:45:45,200 --> 02:45:47,030
from the get-go
but i could only figure it out once the

5982
02:45:47,030 --> 02:45:47,040
but i could only figure it out once the
 

5983
02:45:47,040 --> 02:45:48,710
but i could only figure it out once the
connections were made then it was easy

5984
02:45:48,710 --> 02:45:48,720
connections were made then it was easy
 

5985
02:45:48,720 --> 02:45:50,230
connections were made then it was easy
then it made sense but i tried to figure

5986
02:45:50,230 --> 02:45:50,240
then it made sense but i tried to figure
 

5987
02:45:50,240 --> 02:45:51,269
then it made sense but i tried to figure
it out too early

5988
02:45:51,269 --> 02:45:51,279
it out too early
 

5989
02:45:51,279 --> 02:45:53,910

it'll be like a process of elimination

6396
02:55:00,830 --> 02:55:00,840
it'll be like a process of elimination
 

6397
02:55:00,840 --> 02:55:02,550
it'll be like a process of elimination
thing

6398
02:55:02,550 --> 02:55:02,560
thing
 

6399
02:55:02,560 --> 02:55:06,070
thing
okay yes i'm in the water okay the timer

6400
02:55:06,070 --> 02:55:06,080
okay yes i'm in the water okay the timer
 

6401
02:55:06,080 --> 02:55:07,190
okay yes i'm in the water okay the timer
is on

6402
02:55:07,190 --> 02:55:07,200
is on
 

6403
02:55:07,200 --> 02:55:11,349
is on
okay we also learned that ahmed doesn't

6404
02:55:11,349 --> 02:55:11,359
okay we also learned that ahmed doesn't
 

6405
02:55:11,359 --> 02:55:13,990
okay we also learned that ahmed doesn't
wait i guess at the end i have to pull

6406
02:55:13,990 --> 02:55:14,000
wait i guess at the end i have to pull
 

6407
02:55:14,000 --> 02:55:15,830
wait i guess at the end i have to pull
the lever here and see if that

6408
02:55:15,830 --> 02:55:15,840
the lever here and see if that
 

6409
02:55:15,840 --> 02:55:18,790
the lever here and see if that
lets me out okay oh i'm taking all the

6410
02:55:18,790 --> 02:55:18,800
lets me out okay oh i'm taking all the
 

6411
02:55:18,800 --> 02:55:20,309
lets me out okay oh i'm taking all the
fuses

6412
02:55:20,309 --> 02:55:20,319
fuses
 

6413
02:55:20,319 --> 02:55:23,429
fuses
okay well there's no way that the first

6414
02:55:23,429 --> 02:55:23,439
okay well there's no way that the first
 

6415
02:55:23,439 --> 02:55:24,950
okay well there's no way that the first
combination that we tried is correct

6416
02:55:24,950 --> 02:55:24,960
combination that we tried is correct
 

6417
02:55:24,960 --> 02:55:25,349
combination that we tried is correct
though

6418
02:55:25,349 --> 02:55:25,359
though
 

6419
02:55:25,359 --> 02:55:26,790
though
because it gave me a bunch of different

6420
02:55:26,790 --> 02:55:26,800
because it gave me a bunch of different
 

6421
02:55:26,800 --> 02:55:28,870
because it gave me a bunch of different
colors and

6422
02:55:28,870 --> 02:55:28,880
colors and
 

6423
02:55:28,880 --> 02:55:33,990
colors and
and yeah i just picked a random one

6424
02:55:33,990 --> 02:55:34,000
and yeah i just picked a random one
 

6425
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:37,110
and yeah i just picked a random one
well uh but it sounded like only

6426
02:55:37,110 --> 02:55:37,120
well uh but it sounded like only
 

6427
02:55:37,120 --> 02:55:39,190
well uh but it sounded like only
one could fit in that particular like

6428
02:55:39,190 --> 02:55:39,200
one could fit in that particular like
 

6429
02:55:39,200 --> 02:55:40,710
one could fit in that particular like
whatever you're putting it into

6430
02:55:40,710 --> 02:55:40,720
whatever you're putting it into
 

6431
02:55:40,720 --> 02:55:42,469
whatever you're putting it into
so that's why i thought well if it can

6432
02:55:42,469 --> 02:55:42,479
so that's why i thought well if it can
 

6433
02:55:42,479 --> 02:55:44,710
so that's why i thought well if it can
fit then that must be it

6434
02:55:44,710 --> 02:55:44,720
fit then that must be it
 

6435
02:55:44,720 --> 02:55:46,630
fit then that must be it
but i put a different one in there now

6436
02:55:46,630 --> 02:55:46,640
but i put a different one in there now
 

6437
02:55:46,640 --> 02:55:48,790
but i put a different one in there now
where previously i put in green or

6438
02:55:48,790 --> 02:55:48,800
where previously i put in green or
 

6439
02:55:48,800 --> 02:55:50,070
where previously i put in green or
something i think i put in

6440
02:55:50,070 --> 02:55:50,080
something i think i put in
 

6441
02:55:50,080 --> 02:55:52,630
something i think i put in
red now and then it doesn't there's no

6442
02:55:52,630 --> 02:55:52,640
red now and then it doesn't there's no
 

6443
02:55:52,640 --> 02:55:53,429
red now and then it doesn't there's no
reaction

6444
02:55:53,429 --> 02:55:53,439
reaction
 

6445
02:55:53,439 --> 02:55:55,510
reaction
i guess as long as it maybe maybe

6446
02:55:55,510 --> 02:55:55,520
i guess as long as it maybe maybe
 

6447
02:55:55,520 --> 02:55:56,870
i guess as long as it maybe maybe
because um

6448
02:55:56,870 --> 02:55:56,880
because um
 

6449
02:55:56,880 --> 02:55:58,389
because um
it's about the way it connects like i'm

6450
02:55:58,389 --> 02:55:58,399
it's about the way it connects like i'm
 

6451
02:55:58,399 --> 02:55:59,510
it's about the way it connects like i'm
looking at a double blue one that

6452
02:55:59,510 --> 02:55:59,520
looking at a double blue one that
 

6453
02:55:59,520 --> 02:56:01,110
looking at a double blue one that
connects to a red one that connects to

6454
02:56:01,110 --> 02:56:01,120
connects to a red one that connects to
 

6455
02:56:01,120 --> 02:56:02,469
connects to a red one that connects to
like two different ones

6456
02:56:02,469 --> 02:56:02,479
like two different ones
 

6457
02:56:02,479 --> 02:56:04,550
like two different ones
so maybe it has to go via how it

6458
02:56:04,550 --> 02:56:04,560
so maybe it has to go via how it
 

6459
02:56:04,560 --> 02:56:06,469
so maybe it has to go via how it
connects i don't know

6460
02:56:06,469 --> 02:56:06,479
connects i don't know
 

6461
02:56:06,479 --> 02:56:09,590
connects i don't know
ah uh wait a second uh is that maybe the

6462
02:56:09,590 --> 02:56:09,600
ah uh wait a second uh is that maybe the
 

6463
02:56:09,600 --> 02:56:10,870
ah uh wait a second uh is that maybe the
correct one because it goes green to

6464
02:56:10,870 --> 02:56:10,880
correct one because it goes green to
 

6465
02:56:10,880 --> 02:56:12,070
correct one because it goes green to
green

6466
02:56:12,070 --> 02:56:12,080
green
 

6467
02:56:12,080 --> 02:56:15,190
green
green i don't see any green to green

6468
02:56:15,190 --> 02:56:15,200
green i don't see any green to green
 

6469
02:56:15,200 --> 02:56:19,110
green i don't see any green to green
uh but from the ones that are connected

6470
02:56:19,110 --> 02:56:19,120
uh but from the ones that are connected
 

6471
02:56:19,120 --> 02:56:22,630
uh but from the ones that are connected
to

6472
02:56:22,630 --> 02:56:22,640

 

6473
02:56:22,640 --> 02:56:25,190

or yellow green which ones were

6474
02:56:25,190 --> 02:56:25,200
or yellow green which ones were
 

6475
02:56:25,200 --> 02:56:26,790
or yellow green which ones were
connected to yellow green

6476
02:56:26,790 --> 02:56:26,800
connected to yellow green
 

6477
02:56:26,800 --> 02:56:30,230
connected to yellow green
a single red blue and green a single

6543
02:58:27,920 --> 02:58:29,030

i'm supposed to be telling her but i

can't really discern any pattern here

6546
02:58:32,790 --> 02:58:32,800
can't really discern any pattern here
 

6547
02:58:32,800 --> 02:58:34,790
can't really discern any pattern here
between these they're in the shape of an

6551
02:58:38,240 --> 02:58:40,230

you know maybe maybe there is a pattern

6552
02:58:40,230 --> 02:58:40,240
you know maybe maybe there is a pattern
 

6553
02:58:40,240 --> 02:58:41,429
you know maybe maybe there is a pattern
for it

6554
02:58:41,429 --> 02:58:41,439
for it
 

6555
02:58:41,439 --> 02:58:42,630
for it
well there's four in the middle of a

6556
02:58:42,630 --> 02:58:42,640
well there's four in the middle of a
 

6557
02:58:42,640 --> 02:58:44,870
well there's four in the middle of a
circle maybe that's helpful okay do you

6558
02:58:44,870 --> 02:58:44,880
circle maybe that's helpful okay do you
 

6559
02:58:44,880 --> 02:58:47,110
circle maybe that's helpful okay do you
have anything like the structure the

6560
02:58:47,110 --> 02:58:47,120
have anything like the structure the
 

6561
02:58:47,120 --> 02:58:51,990
have anything like the structure the
pattern wise is there like a circle

6562
02:58:51,990 --> 02:58:52,000

 

6563
02:58:52,000 --> 02:58:56,309

ah

6564
02:58:56,309 --> 02:58:56,319

 

6565
02:58:56,319 --> 02:59:00,070

circle circle yeah like a

6566
02:59:00,070 --> 02:59:00,080
circle circle yeah like a
 

6567
02:59:00,080 --> 02:59:02,309
circle circle yeah like a
i don't know how they're placed but uh

6568
02:59:02,309 --> 02:59:02,319
i don't know how they're placed but uh
 

6569
02:59:02,319 --> 02:59:04,630
i don't know how they're placed but uh
so the the way that mine is there's like

6570
02:59:04,630 --> 02:59:04,640
so the the way that mine is there's like
 

6571
02:59:04,640 --> 02:59:05,030
so the the way that mine is there's like
four

6572
02:59:05,030 --> 02:59:05,040
four
 

6573
02:59:05,040 --> 02:59:08,070
four
inside of a circle and then five

6574
02:59:08,070 --> 02:59:08,080
inside of a circle and then five
 

6575
02:59:08,080 --> 02:59:10,070
inside of a circle and then five
outside of the circle like on the border

6576
02:59:10,070 --> 02:59:10,080
outside of the circle like on the border
 

6577
02:59:10,080 --> 02:59:11,269
outside of the circle like on the border
of the circle so maybe

6578
02:59:11,269 --> 02:59:11,279
of the circle so maybe
 

6579
02:59:11,279 --> 02:59:13,590
of the circle so maybe
if you have any like uh in the middle of

6580
02:59:13,590 --> 02:59:13,600
if you have any like uh in the middle of
 

6581
02:59:13,600 --> 02:59:14,389
if you have any like uh in the middle of
an area

6582
02:59:14,389 --> 02:59:14,399
an area
 

6583
02:59:14,399 --> 02:59:20,790
an area
maybe that'll help

6584
02:59:20,790 --> 02:59:20,800

 

6585
02:59:20,800 --> 02:59:25,269

blue here connected to the okay
so i guess it didn't continue here

6634
03:00:36,790 --> 03:00:36,800
so i guess it didn't continue here
 

6635
03:00:36,800 --> 03:00:47,110
so i guess it didn't continue here
because i didn't have anything there

lever at the at the start and let's see

6664
03:01:29,590 --> 03:01:29,600
lever at the at the start and let's see
 

6665
03:01:29,600 --> 03:01:30,630
lever at the at the start and let's see
what happens

6666
03:01:30,630 --> 03:01:30,640
what happens
 

6667
03:01:30,640 --> 03:01:33,030
what happens
okay yeah if it doesn't connect anything

6668
03:01:33,030 --> 03:01:33,040
okay yeah if it doesn't connect anything
 

6669
03:01:33,040 --> 03:01:35,030
okay yeah if it doesn't connect anything
at all that means that in the beginning

6670
03:01:35,030 --> 03:01:35,040
at all that means that in the beginning
 

6671
03:01:35,040 --> 03:01:36,550
at all that means that in the beginning
that the last pattern we had was

6672
03:01:36,550 --> 03:01:36,560
that the last pattern we had was
 

6673
03:01:36,560 --> 03:01:38,790
that the last pattern we had was
actually correct oh

6674
03:01:38,790 --> 03:01:38,800
actually correct oh
 

6675
03:01:38,800 --> 03:01:42,790
actually correct oh
okay maybe because it did connect up

6676
03:01:42,790 --> 03:01:42,800
okay maybe because it did connect up
 

6677
03:01:42,800 --> 03:01:44,309
okay maybe because it did connect up
until the point where i stopped

6678
03:01:44,309 --> 03:01:44,319
until the point where i stopped
 

6679
03:01:44,319 --> 03:01:53,460
until the point where i stopped
putting in uh what's it called again

oh okay okay i saw oh
so i saw a pattern between the single

6738
03:03:31,510 --> 03:03:31,520
so i saw a pattern between the single
 

6739
03:03:31,520 --> 03:03:33,429
so i saw a pattern between the single
blue and a single orange

6740
03:03:33,429 --> 03:03:33,439
blue and a single orange
 

6741
03:03:33,439 --> 03:03:35,590
blue and a single orange
and then when it got to the orange green

6742
03:03:35,590 --> 03:03:35,600
and then when it got to the orange green
 

6743
03:03:35,600 --> 03:03:36,870
and then when it got to the orange green
it stopped

6744
03:03:36,870 --> 03:03:36,880
it stopped
 

6745
03:03:36,880 --> 03:03:47,100
it stopped
why did that one

6746
03:03:47,100 --> 03:03:47,110

so next i'll just i'll just put

6752
03:03:54,550 --> 03:03:54,560
so next i'll just i'll just put
 

6753
03:03:54,560 --> 03:03:56,469
so next i'll just i'll just put
something something random in there

something something random in there
 

6755
03:03:56,479 --> 03:03:59,590
something something random in there
oh

6756
03:03:59,590 --> 03:03:59,600

 

6757
03:03:59,600 --> 03:04:02,870

okay tell me the colors too okay so

6758
03:04:02,870 --> 03:04:02,880
okay tell me the colors too okay so
 

6759
03:04:02,880 --> 03:04:05,750
okay tell me the colors too okay so
it went from blue single blue to single

6760
03:04:05,750 --> 03:04:05,760
it went from blue single blue to single
 

6761
03:04:05,760 --> 03:04:07,670
it went from blue single blue to single
orange to orange and green and then it

6762
03:04:07,670 --> 03:04:07,680
orange to orange and green and then it
 

6763
03:04:07,680 --> 03:04:08,150
orange to orange and green and then it
stopped

6764
03:04:08,150 --> 03:04:08,160
stopped
 

6765
03:04:08,160 --> 03:04:20,830
stopped
so there's either blue green or single

6766
03:04:20,830 --> 03:04:20,840

pulling the level okay i'm watching from
 

6771
03:04:28,800 --> 03:04:31,269
pulling the level okay i'm watching from
the start this time

6772
03:04:31,269 --> 03:04:31,279
the start this time
 

6773
03:04:31,279 --> 03:04:33,510
the start this time
okay it starts at blue it goes to orange

6774
03:04:33,510 --> 03:04:33,520
okay it starts at blue it goes to orange
 

6775
03:04:33,520 --> 03:04:35,030
okay it starts at blue it goes to orange
and then it goes to orange green

6776
03:04:35,030 --> 03:04:35,040
and then it goes to orange green
 

6777
03:04:35,040 --> 03:04:37,990
and then it goes to orange green
and then it goes to red oh it connected

6778
03:04:37,990 --> 03:04:38,000
and then it goes to red oh it connected
 

6779
03:04:38,000 --> 03:04:39,590
and then it goes to red oh it connected
yeah the red one was correct i think

6780
03:04:39,590 --> 03:04:39,600
yeah the red one was correct i think
 

6781
03:04:39,600 --> 03:04:40,550
yeah the red one was correct i think
yeah yeah yeah it went

6782
03:04:40,550 --> 03:04:40,560
yeah yeah yeah it went
 

6783
03:04:40,560 --> 03:04:42,309
yeah yeah yeah it went
i need to connect with that we're

6784
03:04:42,309 --> 03:04:42,319
i need to connect with that we're
 

6785
03:04:42,319 --> 03:04:43,750
i need to connect with that we're
probably gonna die again this time

6786
03:04:43,750 --> 03:04:43,760
probably gonna die again this time
 

6787
03:04:43,760 --> 03:04:46,389
probably gonna die again this time
but yeah uh so from red it either goes

6788
03:04:46,389 --> 03:04:46,399
but yeah uh so from red it either goes
 

6789
03:04:46,399 --> 03:04:47,349
but yeah uh so from red it either goes
to blue blue

6790
03:04:47,349 --> 03:04:47,359
to blue blue
 

6791
03:04:47,359 --> 03:04:50,070
to blue blue
or blue green i'm guessing blue blue

6792
03:04:50,070 --> 03:04:50,080
or blue green i'm guessing blue blue
 

6793
03:04:50,080 --> 03:04:50,550
or blue green i'm guessing blue blue
because

6794
03:04:50,550 --> 03:04:50,560
because
 

6795
03:04:50,560 --> 03:04:54,389
because
blue green is between uh no uh

6796
03:04:54,389 --> 03:04:54,399
blue green is between uh no uh
 

6797
03:04:54,399 --> 03:04:57,030
blue green is between uh no uh
ah that one automatically connects to

6798
03:04:57,030 --> 03:04:57,040
ah that one automatically connects to
 

6799
03:04:57,040 --> 03:04:58,550
ah that one automatically connects to
one that was already placed there which

6800
03:04:58,550 --> 03:04:58,560
one that was already placed there which
 

6801
03:04:58,560 --> 03:05:02,830
one that was already placed there which
is red blue oh okay okay then blue green

6802
03:05:02,830 --> 03:05:02,840

 

6803
03:05:02,840 --> 03:05:05,670

uh do we have anything connected to red

6804
03:05:05,670 --> 03:05:05,680
uh do we have anything connected to red
 

6805
03:05:05,680 --> 03:05:07,510
uh do we have anything connected to red
blue

6806

was just bad timing i think because i

6814
03:05:33,269 --> 03:05:33,279
was just bad timing i think because i
 

6815
03:05:33,279 --> 03:05:38,309
was just bad timing i think because i
don't know on my side it failed at red

when you tried to wear the same thing
 

6823
03:05:43,840 --> 03:05:45,510
when you tried to wear the same thing
again okay but when you trigger it it

6824
03:05:45,510 --> 03:05:45,520
again okay but when you trigger it it
 

6825
03:05:45,520 --> 03:05:47,830

which is interesting because the wire
 

6863
03:06:38,319 --> 03:06:39,510
which is interesting because the wire
connects it to the tower

out of all those patterns i think only
 

6887
03:07:03,680 --> 03:07:05,429
out of all those patterns i think only
blue blue is the one that

6888
03:07:05,429 --> 03:07:05,439
blue blue is the one that
 

6889
03:07:05,439 --> 03:07:08,550
blue blue is the one that
there's a red green but not a green red

6890
03:07:08,550 --> 03:07:08,560
there's a red green but not a green red

there's a red green but not a green red
okay let me try again maybe it was

03:10:39,200 --> 03:10:40,950
it must be the wrong path because
