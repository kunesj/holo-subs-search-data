one practice run we're going to let them
 

6511
02:37:13,439 --> 02:37:15,349
one practice run we're going to let them
plant on asite and then have Iris and

6512
02:37:15,349 --> 02:37:15,359
plant on asite and then have Iris and
 

6513
02:37:15,359 --> 02:37:17,389
plant on asite and then have Iris and
biu try diffusing uh that way we get an

6514
02:37:17,389 --> 02:37:17,399
biu try diffusing uh that way we get an
 

6515
02:37:17,399 --> 02:37:20,110
biu try diffusing uh that way we get an
idea of how to diffuse you guys like a

6516
02:37:20,110 --> 02:37:20,120
idea of how to diffuse you guys like a
 

6517
02:37:20,120 --> 02:37:21,429
idea of how to diffuse you guys like a
button that shows up on the screen when

6518
02:37:21,429 --> 02:37:21,439
button that shows up on the screen when
 

6519
02:37:21,439 --> 02:37:24,150
button that shows up on the screen when
you're in the diffuse zone or uh yeah I

6520
02:37:24,150 --> 02:37:24,160
you're in the diffuse zone or uh yeah I
 

6521
02:37:24,160 --> 02:37:25,870
you're in the diffuse zone or uh yeah I
think e will show up but it should say

6522
02:37:25,870 --> 02:37:25,880
think e will show up but it should say
 

6523
02:37:25,880 --> 02:37:27,550
think e will show up but it should say
like diffuse but just so you know yeah

6524
02:37:27,550 --> 02:37:27,560
like diffuse but just so you know yeah
 

6525
02:37:27,560 --> 02:37:29,030
like diffuse but just so you know yeah
this good practice you have to hold it

6526
02:37:29,030 --> 02:37:29,040
this good practice you have to hold it
 

6527
02:37:29,040 --> 02:37:30,750
this good practice you have to hold it
for cuz we're counter we're supposed to

6528
02:37:30,750 --> 02:37:30,760
for cuz we're counter we're supposed to
 

6529
02:37:30,760 --> 02:37:32,510
for cuz we're counter we're supposed to
diffuse okay that makes sense come to as

6530
02:37:32,510 --> 02:37:32,520
diffuse okay that makes sense come to as
 

6531
02:37:32,520 --> 02:37:36,269
diffuse okay that makes sense come to as

more wait 40,000 as in you can actually

7674
03:04:14,070 --> 03:04:14,080
more wait 40,000 as in you can actually
 

7675
03:04:14,080 --> 03:04:18,670
more wait 40,000 as in you can actually
spend $40,000 in game on data they they

7676
03:04:18,670 --> 03:04:18,680
spend $40,000 in game on data they they
 

7677
03:04:18,680 --> 03:04:20,630
spend $40,000 in game on data they they
so you can buy cases and it costs like

7678
03:04:20,630 --> 03:04:20,640
so you can buy cases and it costs like
 

7679
03:04:20,640 --> 03:04:23,710
so you can buy cases and it costs like
$2.50 to open each case right but then

7680
03:04:23,710 --> 03:04:23,720
$2.50 to open each case right but then
 

7681
03:04:23,720 --> 03:04:25,910
$2.50 to open each case right but then
it's completely random and the odds are

7682
03:04:25,910 --> 03:04:25,920
it's completely random and the odds are
 

7683
03:04:25,920 --> 03:04:27,950
it's completely random and the odds are
really low but you could get a really

7684
03:04:27,950 --> 03:04:27,960
really low but you could get a really
 

7685
03:04:27,960 --> 03:04:29,990
