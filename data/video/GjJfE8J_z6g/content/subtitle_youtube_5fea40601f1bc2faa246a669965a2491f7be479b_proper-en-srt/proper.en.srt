1
00:00:00,951 --> 00:00:02,052
​​​ ​Would she know that?​ ​​

2
00:00:02,052 --> 00:00:03,754
​​​ ​This is Mel-senpai we're talking about.​ ​​

3
00:00:03,754 --> 00:00:06,490
​​​ ​We'll be the women behind the curtain.​ ​​

4
00:00:04,989 --> 00:00:05,089
​​<i>​ ​​​ ​</i>​

5
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:07,691
​​​ ​I don't know...!​ ​​

6
00:00:07,691 --> 00:00:09,994
​​​ ​I have no idea...!​ ​​

7
00:00:09,994 --> 00:00:12,329
​​​ ​This game is making me feel guilty!​ ​​

8
00:00:12,696 --> 00:00:13,797
​​​ ​Hey! You came, ta!​ ​​

9
00:00:13,797 --> 00:00:16,934
​​​ ​I'm Amane Kanata from hololive's 4th Gen,​ ​​
​​ ​also known as Kanatan.​ ​​

10
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:17,901
​​​ ​And with me is...​ ​​

11
00:00:17,901 --> 00:00:19,336
​​​ ​Hi! Lamyoohoo!​ ​​

12
00:00:19,336 --> 00:00:23,374
​​​ ​I'm Yukihana Lamy from hololive's 5th Gen,​ ​​
​​ ​and my face is a liver!​ ​​

13
00:00:24,074 --> 00:00:25,576
​​​ ​You're saying that yourself now?​ ​​

14
00:00:25,576 --> 00:00:26,577
​​​ ​Then I'll do it too.​ ​​

15
00:00:26,577 --> 00:00:29,380
​​​ ​I have a grip strength of 55kg!​ ​​

16
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:31,648
​​​ ​Anyway.​ ​​

17
00:00:31,648 --> 00:00:35,719
​​​ ​The show we prepared​ ​​
​​ ​for you today is called...​ ​​

18
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:37,187
​​​ ​One, two.​ ​​

19
00:00:37,187 --> 00:00:41,725
​​​ ​Result Manipulation:​ ​​
​​ ​Quiz Control!​ ​​

20
00:00:41,725 --> 00:00:47,264
​​​ ​Lamy and I will be co-hosting it.​ ​​

21
00:00:47,264 --> 00:00:53,337
​​​ ​We already have two contestants​ ​​
​​ ​waiting in another room.​ ​​

22
00:00:53,337 --> 00:00:56,907
​​​ ​However, they won't just be​ ​​
​​ ​getting a fixed set of questions.​ ​​

23
00:00:56,907 --> 00:00:57,941
​​​ ​Isn't that right, Kanatan?​ ​​

24
00:00:57,941 --> 00:00:58,976
​​​ ​Correct.​ ​​

25
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:01,278
​​​ ​It's a bit more complicated than that.​ ​​

26
00:01:01,278 --> 00:01:04,314
​​​ ​Every round, we'll receive an instruction like​ ​​

27
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,949
​​​ ​"Get a correct answer from both,"​ ​​

28
00:01:05,949 --> 00:01:10,220
​​​ ​"Get a correct answer from only one of them,"​ ​​
​​ ​and so on,​ ​​

29
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:14,358
​​​ ​and then we have to choose one of 50 questions​ ​​

30
00:01:12,356 --> 00:01:15,225
​​​ ​How about this one?​ ​​

31
00:01:14,191 --> 00:01:18,162
​​​ ​Isn't that too hard?​ ​​

32
00:01:14,358 --> 00:01:16,627
​​​ ​to try and get that result.​ ​​

33
00:01:15,225 --> 00:01:18,162
​​​ ​Then how about this?​ ​​

34
00:01:16,627 --> 00:01:18,162
​​​ ​Right.​ ​​

35
00:01:18,162 --> 00:01:20,097
​​​ ​So we'll be pulling the strings.​ ​​

36
00:01:20,097 --> 00:01:23,434
​​​ ​We'll be the women behind the curtain.​ ​​

37
00:01:23,434 --> 00:01:26,637
​​​ ​We might have to adapt​ ​​
​​ ​to our contestants, though.​ ​​

38
00:01:26,637 --> 00:01:28,939
​​​ ​Right, choose different questions​ ​​
​​ ​depending on who we get.​ ​​

39
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:30,641
​​​ ​Yeah, yeah!​ ​​
​​ ​Right, choose different questions​ ​​
​​ ​depending on who we get.​ ​​

40
00:01:30,641 --> 00:01:35,446
​​​ ​Let's find out who they are, then.​ ​​

41
00:01:35,446 --> 00:01:36,280
​​​ ​That's important to know.​ ​​

42
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,115
​​​ ​Very important. Who do we have?​ ​​
​​ ​That's important to know.​ ​​

43
00:01:38,115 --> 00:01:44,688
​​​ ​1st Gen​ ​​
​​ ​Yozora Mel​ ​​

44
00:01:38,115 --> 00:01:44,688
​​​ ​EN Myth​ ​​
​​ ​Takanashi Kiara​ ​​

45
00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:44,688
​​​ ​I see!​ ​​

46
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:46,123
​​​ ​So... What do you think?​ ​​

47
00:01:46,123 --> 00:01:48,158
​​​ ​You sounded pretty confident earlier on.​ ​​

48
00:01:48,158 --> 00:01:49,359
​​​ ​Well...​ ​​

49
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,696
​​​ ​Kiara might just...​ ​​

50
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:56,033
​​​ ​be predictable enough​ ​​
​​ ​to get the answers we want,​ ​​

51
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:59,269
​​​ ​but Mel-senpai is a total mystery.​ ​​

52
00:01:59,269 --> 00:02:04,341
​​​ ​She's the worst we could get!​ ​​

53
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,945
​​​ ​Right, she's the most unpredictable​ ​​

54
00:02:07,945 --> 00:02:11,181
​​​ ​of all of hololive​ ​​
​​ ​when it comes to quiz shows.​ ​​

55
00:02:11,181 --> 00:02:12,683
​​​ ​She really is.​ ​​

56
00:02:12,683 --> 00:02:16,320
​​​ ​She takes you by surprise every time!​ ​​

57
00:02:17,087 --> 00:02:20,157
​​​ ​Apparently we can talk with them for a bit,​ ​​

58
00:02:20,157 --> 00:02:21,992
​​​ ​so let's open the intercom.​ ​​

59
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:23,994
​​​ ​Mel-senpai! Kiara!​ ​​

60
00:02:23,994 --> 00:02:26,230
​​​ ​Can you hear us?​ ​​

61
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,364
​​​ ​Yes!​ ​​

62
00:02:27,364 --> 00:02:29,833
​​​ ​I hear you!​ ​​

63
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,668
​​​ ​Kikkeriki!​ ​​

64
00:02:31,668 --> 00:02:36,140
​​​ ​As you know, we called you here​ ​​
​​ ​to take a quiz today,​ ​​

65
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,142
​​​ ​but before we start, please say a few words.​ ​​

66
00:02:38,775 --> 00:02:39,877
​​​ ​Just like that?​ ​​

67
00:02:39,877 --> 00:02:42,779
​​​ ​Um...​ ​​

68
00:02:42,779 --> 00:02:46,116
​​​ ​I'm not sure what​ ​​
​​ ​this is all about, but anyway.​ ​​

69
00:02:46,116 --> 00:02:48,085
​​​ ​I'm Mel, a genius vampire​ ​​
​​ ​from the Underworld,​ ​​

70
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:49,887
​​​ ​and I'm ready to impress!​ ​​

71
00:02:51,355 --> 00:02:52,256
​​​ ​Such confidence...​ ​​

72
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:53,657
​​​ ​She's confident, all right.​ ​​

73
00:02:53,657 --> 00:02:55,325
​​​ ​So confident...​ ​​

74
00:02:55,325 --> 00:02:56,827
​​​ ​What about you, Kiara-chan?​ ​​

75
00:02:56,827 --> 00:02:57,995
​​​ ​Well...​ ​​

76
00:02:57,995 --> 00:02:59,630
​​​ ​I'm pretty nervous,​ ​​

77
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,198
​​​ ​but since you invited me here,​ ​​

78
00:03:01,198 --> 00:03:03,634
​​​ ​I guess you think I'm smart?​ ​​

79
00:03:03,634 --> 00:03:04,168
​​​ ​We do.​ ​​

80
00:03:04,168 --> 00:03:05,602
​​​ ​Yeah, we do!​ ​​

81
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,337
​​​ ​We all think you're brilliant!​ ​​

82
00:03:07,337 --> 00:03:11,441
​​​ ​Now, I hear the quiz will be starting soon,​ ​​

83
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,677
​​​ ​so please be on standby.​ ​​

84
00:03:13,677 --> 00:03:14,845
​​​ ​All right!​ ​​

85
00:03:14,845 --> 00:03:16,180
​​​ ​We'll wait!​ ​​

86
00:03:16,647 --> 00:03:18,048
​​​ ​So... Now what?​ ​​

87
00:03:18,048 --> 00:03:18,649
​​​ ​Right?​ ​​
​​ ​So... Now what?​ ​​

88
00:03:20,551 --> 00:03:23,387
​​​ ​Mel-senpai and Kiara-chan...​ ​​

89
00:03:23,387 --> 00:03:24,788
​​​ ​I have no idea how they'll answer.​ ​​

90
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:26,657
​​​ ​You just don't know, yeah.​ ​​
​​ ​I have no idea how they'll answer.​ ​​

91
00:03:26,657 --> 00:03:27,791
​​​ ​But either way...​ ​​

92
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:31,028
​​​ ​Let's try our best to​ ​​
​​ ​control their answers, Kanatan!​ ​​

93
00:03:31,028 --> 00:03:33,030
​​​ ​Quiz Control​ ​​

94
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:36,733
​​​ ​The first result we're going for is...?​ ​​

95
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:40,904
​​​ ​Get correct answers from both!​ ​​

96
00:03:38,535 --> 00:03:40,003
​​​ ​A correct answer from both.​ ​​

97
00:03:40,003 --> 00:03:40,904
​​​ ​I see.​ ​​

98
00:03:40,904 --> 00:03:43,307
​​​ ​That should be simple, no?​ ​​

99
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:46,677
​​​ ​We just need to find​ ​​
​​ ​an easy question, don't we?​ ​​

100
00:03:46,677 --> 00:03:47,744
​​​ ​Let's see...​ ​​

101
00:03:47,744 --> 00:03:49,413
​​​ ​How about #21?​ ​​

102
00:03:49,413 --> 00:04:04,928
​​​ ​Q21: How many days are in a year?​ ​​

103
00:03:49,947 --> 00:03:51,748
​​​ ​Ah, days in a year? That's perfect!​ ​​

104
00:03:51,748 --> 00:03:52,649
​​​ ​That's perfect.​ ​​

105
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,017
​​​ ​This one's perfect.​ ​​

106
00:03:54,017 --> 00:03:55,552
​​​ ​"How many days are in a year?"​ ​​

107
00:03:55,552 --> 00:03:57,221
​​​ ​They have to know that.​ ​​

108
00:03:57,221 --> 00:04:00,090
​​​ ​There's no way they'll get it wrong.​ ​​

109
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,825
​​​ ​By the way, you know the answer, right?​ ​​

110
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:04,228
​​​ ​Of course. It's 365.​ ​​

111
00:04:04,228 --> 00:04:04,928
​​​ ​That's a relief.​ ​​

112
00:04:04,928 --> 00:04:09,433
​​​ ​* The question sheet does not include the answers​ ​​

113
00:04:04,928 --> 00:04:08,298
​​​ ​Whew, I got it right.​ ​​
​​ ​You'd lose your juniors' respect​ ​​
​​ ​if you failed that.​ ​​

114
00:04:08,298 --> 00:04:09,433
​​​ ​That was a close one.​ ​​

115
00:04:09,433 --> 00:04:10,634
​​​ ​I felt a bit of cold sweat there.​ ​​

116
00:04:11,068 --> 00:04:12,302
​​​ ​Let's roll with this one, then.​ ​​

117
00:04:12,302 --> 00:04:13,503
​​​ ​This should work.​ ​​

118
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,338
​​​ ​Yes, let's go with #21.​ ​​

119
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:16,640
​​​ ​"How many days are in a year?"​ ​​

120
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,407
​​​ ​All right!​ ​​
​​ ​"How many days are in a year?"​ ​​

121
00:04:18,141 --> 00:04:19,876
​​​ ​Can you hear us?​ ​​

122
00:04:19,876 --> 00:04:21,545
​​​ ​We can!​ ​​
​​ ​You're finally back!​ ​​

123
00:04:21,545 --> 00:04:22,746
​​​ ​Well then.​ ​​

124
00:04:22,746 --> 00:04:25,282
​​​ ​Here is your first question!​ ​​

125
00:04:27,251 --> 00:04:29,987
​​​ ​How many days are in a year?​ ​​

126
00:04:29,987 --> 00:04:31,321
​​​ ​Please write down your answers!​ ​​

127
00:04:31,321 --> 00:04:34,124
​​​ ​Shouldn't you give us some time to think?​ ​​

128
00:04:34,124 --> 00:04:36,026
​​​ ​Isn't that something everyone knows?​ ​​

129
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:39,997
​​​ ​They must think we're stupid or something!​ ​​

130
00:04:39,997 --> 00:04:43,267
​​​ ​So, did you manage to​ ​​
​​ ​come up with an answer?​ ​​

131
00:04:43,267 --> 00:04:44,401
​​​ ​Of course I did.​ ​​

132
00:04:44,401 --> 00:04:45,135
​​​ ​Of course!​ ​​

133
00:04:45,135 --> 00:04:48,872
​​​ ​Then let's look at what you wrote!​ ​​

134
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,307
​​​ ​Here we go!​ ​​

135
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:53,744
​​​ ​There we have it.​ ​​

136
00:04:53,744 --> 00:04:58,749
​​​ ​So you both answered 365.​ ​​

137
00:04:58,749 --> 00:05:00,584
​​​ ​The correct answer is...​ ​​

138
00:05:00,584 --> 00:05:01,218
​​​ ​What could it be?​ ​​

139
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:04,388
​​​ ​three hundred and sixty-... five days!​ ​​

140
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:05,756
​​​ ​three hundred and sixty-... five days!​ ​​

141
00:05:05,856 --> 00:05:10,394
​​​ ​Correct answer: 365 days​ ​​

142
00:05:06,123 --> 00:05:10,394
​​​ ​You both got it right!​ ​​

143
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:13,930
​​​ ​Leap years have 366, though.​ ​​

144
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,032
​​​ ​I see we have an expert.​ ​​

145
00:05:15,032 --> 00:05:16,600
​​​ ​I'm impressed!​ ​​

146
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,103
​​​ ​So both of you answered correctly.​ ​​

147
00:05:20,103 --> 00:05:21,138
​​​ ​Amazing.​ ​​

148
00:05:21,438 --> 00:05:23,373
​​​ ​Before we move on to the next question,​ ​​

149
00:05:23,373 --> 00:05:25,375
​​​ ​please give us a moment to prepare.​ ​​

150
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,143
​​​ ​Just a moment.​ ​​

151
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:28,078
​​​ ​You're making us wait again?!​ ​​

152
00:05:28,445 --> 00:05:32,749
​​​ ​Get correct answers from both​ ​​
​​ ​Manipulation successful!​ ​​

153
00:05:28,845 --> 00:05:31,081
​​​ ​That went just as planned, didn't it?​ ​​

154
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,749
​​​ ​I'm glad it did.​ ​​
​​ ​That went just as planned, didn't it?​ ​​

155
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,419
​​​ ​They're easier to manipulate than I thought.​ ​​

156
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:36,753
​​​ ​It's working, right?​ ​​

157
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:37,654
​​​ ​It is, it is.​ ​​

158
00:05:37,654 --> 00:05:39,389
​​​ ​So now that we've gotten the hang of it...​ ​​

159
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:40,824
​​​ ​Let's move on to the next question, shall we?​ ​​

160
00:05:40,824 --> 00:05:41,925
​​​ ​Yeah, let's do it.​ ​​
​​ ​Let's move on to the next question, shall we?​ ​​

161
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:45,028
​​​ ​What are we going for this time?​ ​​

162
00:05:45,028 --> 00:05:49,900
​​​ ​Get a correct answer from only Kiara!​ ​​

163
00:05:46,797 --> 00:05:49,900
​​​ ​"Get a correct answer from only Kiara."​ ​​

164
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,002
​​​ ​This one should also be easy, no?​ ​​

165
00:05:52,002 --> 00:05:53,236
​​​ ​How about something English-related?​ ​​

166
00:05:53,236 --> 00:05:55,072
​​​ ​Exactly my idea!​ ​​
​​ ​How about something English-related?​ ​​

167
00:05:55,072 --> 00:05:57,007
​​​ ​Like question 8 for example.​ ​​

168
00:05:57,007 --> 00:06:09,286
​​​ ​Q8: Write <i>vanpaia </i>(vampire) in English​ ​​

169
00:05:57,007 --> 00:05:59,109
​​​ ​Yeah, that should be hard for Mel-senpai.​ ​​

170
00:05:59,109 --> 00:05:59,743
​​​ ​Ah, but wait.​ ​​

171
00:05:59,743 --> 00:06:05,549
​​​ ​Recently there was this popular game​ ​​
​​ ​with "vampire" in the name.​ ​​

172
00:06:05,549 --> 00:06:07,718
​​​ ​She might just know it from that.​ ​​

173
00:06:07,718 --> 00:06:09,286
​​​ ​So you're saying there's a chance.​ ​​

174
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:10,587
​​​ ​She might be a lucky devil, yeah.​ ​​

175
00:06:10,587 --> 00:06:12,322
​​​ ​She's a vampire,​ ​​
​​ ​but she might just be a lucky devil.​ ​​

176
00:06:12,522 --> 00:06:14,157
​​​ ​Let's pick a different one, then.​ ​​

177
00:06:14,157 --> 00:06:18,028
​​​ ​How about #15,​ ​​
​​ ​"Write Kiara's last name using kanji"?​ ​​

178
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:27,571
​​​ ​Q15: Write "Takanashi" using kanji​ ​​

179
00:06:18,829 --> 00:06:20,530
​​​ ​Can Kiara do that, though?​ ​​

180
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,032
​​​ ​I mean, I guess she can...​ ​​

181
00:06:22,032 --> 00:06:24,000
​​​ ​What do you mean?​ ​​
​​ ​Of course she—​ ​​

182
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,969
​​​ ​Surely she can, right?!​ ​​

183
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,571
​​​ ​Write her own name.​ ​​

184
00:06:27,571 --> 00:06:31,775
​​​ ​It'd be super awkward for her​ ​​
​​ ​if she couldn't, so let's not.​ ​​

185
00:06:31,775 --> 00:06:34,478
​​​ ​What about question 6, then?​ ​​

186
00:06:33,777 --> 00:06:44,020
​​​ ​Q6: Write <i>niwatori </i>(chicken) in English.​ ​​

187
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,881
​​​ ​That's a good one.​ ​​
​​ ​"Write <i>niwatori </i>(chicken) in English."​ ​​

188
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:39,883
​​​ ​That should do the trick, no?​ ​​

189
00:06:39,883 --> 00:06:41,952
​​​ ​Couldn't Mel-senpai do that too, though?​ ​​

190
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:44,020
​​​ ​Could she?​ ​​

191
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:47,357
​​​ ​This is Mel-senpai we're talking about.​ ​​

192
00:06:47,357 --> 00:06:49,893
​​​ ​Hey! That's not very nice, is it?​ ​​

193
00:06:49,893 --> 00:06:52,696
​​​ ​Let's go with #6 then.​ ​​

194
00:06:52,696 --> 00:06:53,497
​​​ ​Can you hear us?​ ​​

195
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:54,831
​​​ ​Sorry to keep you waiting!​ ​​

196
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:57,868
​​​ ​We're back!​ ​​

197
00:06:57,868 --> 00:06:58,835
​​​ ​Sorry about the wait!​ ​​

198
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:03,340
​​​ ​Well then, here is the next question!​ ​​

199
00:07:05,108 --> 00:07:06,810
​​​ ​"Write <i>niwatori </i>in English."​ ​​

200
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:07,844
​​​ ​Yes!​ ​​
​​ ​"Write <i>niwatori </i>in English."​ ​​

201
00:07:08,445 --> 00:07:10,247
​​​ ​What do you think of this one?​ ​​

202
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,615
​​​ ​Wait a second.​ ​​

203
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:13,917
​​​ ​Kiara-chan is at an advantage here!​ ​​

204
00:07:13,917 --> 00:07:16,186
​​​ ​Piece of cake.​ ​​

205
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:17,020
​​​ ​What...?​ ​​

206
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,121
​​​ ​Wait, wait, wait.​ ​​

207
00:07:18,121 --> 00:07:19,656
​​<i>​ ​Niwatori </i>in English...?​ ​​

208
00:07:20,323 --> 00:07:23,493
​​​ ​I can't wait to see Mel-senpai's answer.​ ​​

209
00:07:23,493 --> 00:07:26,296
​​​ ​There's no way she knows it.​ ​​

210
00:07:26,296 --> 00:07:27,364
​​​ ​No way in hell!​ ​​

211
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:28,932
​​​ ​Okay, maybe that's a bit much.​ ​​

212
00:07:28,932 --> 00:07:30,467
​​​ ​I don't think she knows.​ ​​

213
00:07:30,467 --> 00:07:32,969
​​​ ​What about you, Kanatan?​ ​​
​​ ​Do you know it?​ ​​

214
00:07:32,969 --> 00:07:34,604
​​​ ​Cock-a-doodle-doo.​ ​​

215
00:07:34,604 --> 00:07:34,805
​​​ ​What?​ ​​
​​ ​Cock-a-doodle-doo.​ ​​

216
00:07:34,805 --> 00:07:37,274
​​​ ​Cock-a-doodle-doo.​ ​​

217
00:07:37,274 --> 00:07:38,275
​​​ ​No way it's that.​ ​​

218
00:07:38,275 --> 00:07:39,176
​​​ ​Wait, it's not?​ ​​

219
00:07:39,176 --> 00:07:40,577
​​​ ​I'm done!​ ​​

220
00:07:40,577 --> 00:07:42,546
​​​ ​I wrote my answer!​ ​​

221
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:43,246
​​​ ​You're done?​ ​​

222
00:07:43,246 --> 00:07:43,947
​​​ ​Then let's take a look.​ ​​

223
00:07:43,947 --> 00:07:45,649
​​​ ​Let's take a look!​ ​​
​​ ​Then let's take a look.​ ​​

224
00:07:45,649 --> 00:07:47,617
​​​ ​All right.​ ​​

225
00:07:47,617 --> 00:07:49,686
​​​ ​How confident are you feeling?​ ​​

226
00:07:49,686 --> 00:07:52,756
​​​ ​I'm confident about my English skills, all right.​ ​​

227
00:07:52,756 --> 00:07:53,690
​​​ ​This isn't fair!​ ​​

228
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:58,028
​​​ ​If anything, it'd be worrying​ ​​
​​ ​if Kiara got this wrong.​ ​​

229
00:07:58,028 --> 00:08:01,097
​​​ ​Let's look at their answers, shall we?​ ​​

230
00:08:01,097 --> 00:08:02,199
​​​ ​Let's take a look.​ ​​
​​ ​Let's look at their answers, shall we?​ ​​

231
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:05,001
​​​ ​Reveal the answers!​ ​​

232
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,276
​​​ ​Mel-senpai!​ ​​

233
00:08:13,877 --> 00:08:15,979
​​​ ​Kiara's writing is so small​ ​​
​​ ​I can barely read it.​ ​​

234
00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:18,181
​​​ ​Kiara's one is tiny!​ ​​

235
00:08:18,181 --> 00:08:20,150
​​​ ​It's so small.​ ​​

236
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:22,385
​​​ ​Meanwhile, Mel-Mel's answer is...​ ​​

237
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:25,288
​​​ ​"Garden Bird."​ ​​

238
00:08:25,288 --> 00:08:26,289
​​​ ​"Cluck."​ ​​
​​ ​"Cluck."​ ​​

239
00:08:27,057 --> 00:08:30,827
​​<i>​ ​Niwa​ ​</i>​
​​ ​(Garden)​ ​​

240
00:08:27,057 --> 00:08:30,827
​​​ ​You split it into <i>niwa-tori </i>(garden-bird), didn't you?​ ​​

241
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:30,827
​​<i>​ ​Tori​ ​</i>​
​​ ​(Bird)​ ​​

242
00:08:30,827 --> 00:08:34,097
​​​ ​Genius​ ​​

243
00:08:30,827 --> 00:08:32,262
​​​ ​That's brilliant.​ ​​

244
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:34,097
​​​ ​It really is.​ ​​

245
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:36,166
​​​ ​Here is the correct answer!​ ​​

246
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:40,971
​​​ ​Correct answer: Chicken​ ​​

247
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,934
​​​ ​"Chicken"!​ ​​

248
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,503
​​​ ​Of course it's that!​ ​​

249
00:08:39,503 --> 00:08:40,971
​​​ ​Of course!​ ​​

250
00:08:40,971 --> 00:08:48,411
​​​ ​Get a correct answer from only Kiara​ ​​
​​ ​Manipulation successful!​ ​​

251
00:08:40,971 --> 00:08:42,405
​​​ ​So only Kiara got it right.​ ​​

252
00:08:42,405 --> 00:08:45,809
​​​ ​You get a "well done" flower from us.​ ​​

253
00:08:45,809 --> 00:08:47,511
​​​ ​That deserves a flower!​ ​​

254
00:08:46,243 --> 00:08:48,411
​​​ ​Thank you!​ ​​

255
00:08:47,511 --> 00:08:48,411
​​​ ​Amazing!​ ​​

256
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:51,114
​​​ ​We'd like to go prepare the next question,​ ​​

257
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:55,218
​​​ ​so please give us a moment.​ ​​

258
00:08:55,218 --> 00:08:57,621
​​​ ​So it's "chicken," huh.​ ​​

259
00:08:57,621 --> 00:08:59,523
​​​ ​Of course it is!​ ​​

260
00:08:59,523 --> 00:09:01,191
​​​ ​Did you seriously not know that, Kanatan?!​ ​​

261
00:09:01,191 --> 00:09:03,293
​​​ ​Maybe you belong over there instead.​ ​​

262
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:05,095
​​​ ​Wait, no! No way! How?!​ ​​

263
00:09:05,095 --> 00:09:07,197
​​​ ​Let's see what our next goal is, then.​ ​​

264
00:09:07,197 --> 00:09:08,365
​​​ ​Let's go!​ ​​

265
00:09:08,365 --> 00:09:12,636
​​​ ​Get a correct answer from only Mel!​ ​​

266
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:15,038
​​​ ​This is the hardest one yet.​ ​​

267
00:09:15,038 --> 00:09:16,206
​​​ ​It doesn't get any harder than this.​ ​​

268
00:09:16,206 --> 00:09:17,507
​​​ ​What do we pick?​ ​​

269
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:19,442
​​​ ​How about #30?​ ​​

270
00:09:19,442 --> 00:09:22,779
​​​ ​"What does <i>agari </i>refer to in sushi restaurants?"​ ​​

271
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:24,047
​​​ ​Do you know, Kanatan?​ ​​

272
00:09:24,047 --> 00:09:25,382
​​​ ​It's tea!​ ​​

273
00:09:25,382 --> 00:09:26,783
​​​ ​That's correct!​ ​​

274
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,751
​​​ ​I think.​ ​​

275
00:09:27,751 --> 00:09:28,718
​​​ ​I think it's that.​ ​​

276
00:09:28,718 --> 00:09:30,520
​​​ ​Mel-senpai should know...​ ​​

277
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,621
​​​ ​Would she know this one?​ ​​

278
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:34,524
​​​ ​She might not.​ ​​

279
00:09:34,524 --> 00:09:35,825
​​​ ​I'm not sure anymore.​ ​​

280
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,328
​​​ ​We need something Japanese.​ ​​

281
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:41,698
​​​ ​Yeah, something specific to Japan.​ ​​

282
00:09:41,698 --> 00:09:46,336
​​​ ​How about #4: "What ingredient do miso,​ ​​
​​ ​tofu, and soy sauce have in common?"​ ​​

283
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,338
​​​ ​Would you say "soy beans," Mel-senpai?​ ​​

284
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:49,272
​​​ ​Soy beans.​ ​​

285
00:09:49,439 --> 00:09:52,342
​​​ ​She just has to know the answer to this.​ ​​

286
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:55,312
​​​ ​All right. Let's go with question 4:​ ​​

287
00:09:55,312 --> 00:10:01,985
​​​ ​"What ingredient do miso, tofu,​ ​​
​​ ​and soy sauce have in common?"​ ​​

288
00:10:02,619 --> 00:10:03,787
​​​ ​Can you hear us?​ ​​

289
00:10:03,787 --> 00:10:05,355
​​​ ​Do you hear us?​ ​​
​​ ​Can you hear us?​ ​​

290
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:06,122
​​​ ​We do!​ ​​

291
00:10:06,122 --> 00:10:07,290
​​​ ​All right!​ ​​

292
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:12,095
​​​ ​Then get ready for the next question!​ ​​

293
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:17,567
​​​ ​What ingredient do miso, tofu,​ ​​
​​ ​and soy sauce have in common?​ ​​

294
00:10:17,567 --> 00:10:21,204
​​​ ​Take some time to think about it!​ ​​

295
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:24,808
​​​ ​Wait, is this about a dish​ ​​
​​ ​based on those three?​ ​​

296
00:10:24,808 --> 00:10:26,409
​​​ ​No, it's not that.​ ​​

297
00:10:26,409 --> 00:10:29,346
​​​ ​It's the material that they're made from.​ ​​

298
00:10:29,346 --> 00:10:31,848
​​​ ​Don't give her hints, Mel-Mel!​ ​​

299
00:10:31,848 --> 00:10:34,150
​​​ ​She'll find the answer if you're not careful.​ ​​

300
00:10:35,952 --> 00:10:37,187
​​​ ​I don't know...!​ ​​

301
00:10:37,187 --> 00:10:39,656
​​​ ​I have no idea...!​ ​​

302
00:10:39,656 --> 00:10:42,826
​​​ ​This game is making me feel guilty!​ ​​

303
00:10:42,826 --> 00:10:43,326
​​​ ​Huh?​ ​​

304
00:10:43,326 --> 00:10:44,194
​​​ ​Wait, wait.​ ​​

305
00:10:44,194 --> 00:10:46,096
​​​ ​Am I having the wrong idea?​ ​​

306
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:48,832
​​​ ​Mel-Mel?!​ ​​

307
00:10:48,832 --> 00:10:51,835
​​​ ​What are you guys made of...?​ ​​

308
00:10:51,835 --> 00:10:53,303
​​​ ​She's talking to them.​ ​​

309
00:10:53,303 --> 00:10:54,838
​​​ ​She's asking them!​ ​​

310
00:10:54,838 --> 00:10:57,340
​​​ ​Should we go back to them​ ​​

311
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,009
​​​ ​before she changes her mind?​ ​​

312
00:11:01,678 --> 00:11:02,946
​​​ ​Let's go back, yeah.​ ​​

313
00:11:02,946 --> 00:11:04,447
​​​ ​Let's go back, let's go back.​ ​​

314
00:11:04,447 --> 00:11:06,916
​​​ ​So... How did it go?​ ​​

315
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,653
​​​ ​Did you manage to come up with an answer?​ ​​

316
00:11:09,653 --> 00:11:11,321
​​​ ​Kind of...?​ ​​

317
00:11:11,321 --> 00:11:12,389
​​​ ​Sure...​ ​​

318
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:14,090
​​​ ​That doesn't sound very convincing, does it?​ ​​

319
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,426
​​​ ​I'm really not sure about this!​ ​​

320
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:21,498
​​​ ​Let's look at Kiara's answer first.​ ​​

321
00:11:21,498 --> 00:11:22,332
​​​ ​Here it is!​ ​​

322
00:11:22,332 --> 00:11:33,743
​​​ ​soy sauce?​ ​​

323
00:11:24,668 --> 00:11:26,036
​​​ ​Cute!​ ​​
​​ ​Right, soy sauce!​ ​​

324
00:11:26,036 --> 00:11:28,705
​​​ ​So it's all made of soy sauce.​ ​​

325
00:11:28,705 --> 00:11:30,407
​​​ ​I see, I see.​ ​​

326
00:11:30,407 --> 00:11:33,743
​​​ ​You're super close, actually.​ ​​

327
00:11:33,743 --> 00:11:35,011
​​​ ​And the drawing is cute.​ ​​

328
00:11:35,011 --> 00:11:35,745
​​​ ​It is.​ ​​
​​ ​And the drawing is cute.​ ​​

329
00:11:35,745 --> 00:11:37,747
​​​ ​That's a billion points on top.​ ​​

330
00:11:37,747 --> 00:11:40,917
​​​ ​One billion bonus points.​ ​​

331
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:43,286
​​​ ​And now for Mel-Mel.​ ​​

332
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:44,354
​​​ ​I'm a bit worried.​ ​​

333
00:11:44,354 --> 00:11:45,989
​​​ ​You know the answer, right?​ ​​

334
00:11:45,989 --> 00:11:48,725
​​​ ​This was easy for you, right, Mel-senpai?​ ​​

335
00:11:48,725 --> 00:11:50,994
​​​ ​Yeah, it's basically free points.​ ​​

336
00:11:50,994 --> 00:11:53,096
​​​ ​It sure is.​ ​​

337
00:11:53,096 --> 00:11:57,200
​​​ ​Then let's see Mel-Mel's answer!​ ​​

338
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:08,411
​​​ ​beans​ ​​

339
00:11:58,668 --> 00:12:02,238
​​​ ​Can we accept this?​ ​​

340
00:12:02,238 --> 00:12:04,240
​​​ ​Does this count?​ ​​

341
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,576
​​​ ​Mel-Mel, what kind of beans do you mean?​ ​​

342
00:12:06,576 --> 00:12:08,411
​​​ ​Please do elaborate.​ ​​

343
00:12:08,878 --> 00:12:10,613
​​​ ​I only know the <i>edamame </i>kind.​ ​​

344
00:12:10,613 --> 00:12:13,483
​​​ ​You only know edamame?!​ ​​
​​ ​Edamame?!​ ​​

345
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:14,918
​​​ ​Is there even anything else?​ ​​

346
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:19,155
​​​ ​Did either of them get it right, I wonder?​ ​​

347
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,825
​​​ ​The correct answer is... this!​ ​​

348
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:31,434
​​​ ​Correct answer: Soy beans​ ​​

349
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:25,395
​​​ ​Soy beans!​ ​​

350
00:12:25,395 --> 00:12:31,434
​​​ ​Which means both of you got it wrong, I guess.​ ​​

351
00:12:31,434 --> 00:12:33,269
​​​ ​Why doesn't mine count? I wrote "beans."​ ​​

352
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:36,740
​​​ ​You only know about​ ​​
​<i>​ ​edamame </i>though, don't you?​ ​​

353
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,307
​​​ ​No worries.​ ​​

354
00:12:37,307 --> 00:12:39,943
​​​ ​You can make up for it in the next round.​ ​​

355
00:12:39,943 --> 00:12:42,045
​​​ ​That's right.​ ​​
​​ ​You can make up for it in the next round.​ ​​

356
00:12:42,045 --> 00:12:46,816
​​​ ​We're going to prepare the next question,​ ​​
​​ ​so please give us another moment!​ ​​

357
00:12:46,816 --> 00:12:51,955
​​​ ​Get a correct answer from only Mel​ ​​
​​ ​Manipulation failed!​ ​​

358
00:12:49,319 --> 00:12:50,754
​​​ ​That was...​ ​​

359
00:12:51,955 --> 00:12:55,225
​​​ ​Only knows about edamame​ ​​

360
00:12:51,955 --> 00:12:55,225
​​​ ​"She only knows about edamame"?​ ​​
​​ ​I can't explain that away!​ ​​

361
00:12:55,225 --> 00:12:59,662
​​​ ​Trivia​ ​​
​​ ​Edamame are just soy beans harvested at an earlier stage.​ ​​
​​ ​They're from the same plant.​ ​​

362
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,093
​​​ ​Wait, what?​ ​​

363
00:12:57,093 --> 00:12:59,662
​​​ ​Edamame are soy beans too?!​ ​​

364
00:13:01,397 --> 00:13:07,403
​​​ ​Let us see what our next manipulation goal is.​ ​​

365
00:13:07,403 --> 00:13:11,441
​​​ ​Get correct answers from both!​ ​​

366
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,441
​​​ ​So we again need a correct answer​ ​​
​​ ​from both of them.​ ​​

367
00:13:11,441 --> 00:13:13,443
​​​ ​That should be easy, no?​ ​​

368
00:13:13,443 --> 00:13:19,382
​​​ ​Yeah, it's way easier than​ ​​
​​ ​finding something only Mel-Mel knows.​ ​​

369
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:21,317
​​​ ​It's like you keep taking jabs at her.​ ​​

370
00:13:21,317 --> 00:13:23,353
​​​ ​Oh no! She'll get mad at me...​ ​​

371
00:13:23,353 --> 00:13:28,224
​​​ ​The remaining questions​ ​​
​​ ​are all pretty hard, though.​ ​​

372
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:33,997
​​​ ​How about #17: "Which children's story​ ​​
​​ ​features a poisoned apple?"​ ​​

373
00:13:33,997 --> 00:13:36,065
​​​ ​That would of course be...​ ​​

374
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,168
​​​ ​Sssnow White.​ ​​

375
00:13:38,168 --> 00:13:40,103
​​​ ​Wait, you hesitated there. What?​ ​​

376
00:13:40,436 --> 00:13:42,605
​​​ ​Which one would you pick?​ ​​

377
00:13:42,605 --> 00:13:46,943
​​​ ​#16 for example.​ ​​
​​ ​"The opposite of east," which is west.​ ​​

378
00:13:47,043 --> 00:13:50,747
​​​ ​They'll know this one for sure,​ ​​
​​ ​don't you think?​ ​​

379
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,448
​​​ ​I wonder if Mel-Mel does.​ ​​

380
00:13:52,448 --> 00:13:54,384
​​​ ​That's the thing with hololive members.​ ​​

381
00:13:54,384 --> 00:13:59,722
​​​ ​North​ ​​

382
00:13:54,384 --> 00:13:58,121
​​​ ​They only know north.​ ​​

383
00:13:58,121 --> 00:13:59,722
​​​ ​Let's steer clear of this one, then.​ ​​

384
00:13:59,722 --> 00:14:03,293
​​​ ​"Which letter comes after N in the alphabet?"​ ​​

385
00:14:03,293 --> 00:14:04,227
​​​ ​They have to know that.​ ​​

386
00:14:11,067 --> 00:14:12,535
​​​ ​It's M!​ ​​

387
00:14:12,535 --> 00:14:14,537
​​​ ​Cute.​ ​​

388
00:14:14,537 --> 00:14:15,171
​​​ ​Let's go with this.​ ​​

389
00:14:15,171 --> 00:14:16,706
​​​ ​I'm worried about Mel-Mel, though.​ ​​

390
00:14:16,706 --> 00:14:17,507
​​​ ​I'm not sure she'll remember the song.​ ​​

391
00:14:17,507 --> 00:14:18,908
​​​ ​What kind of dunce do you take her for?!​ ​​
​​ ​I'm not sure she'll remember the song.​ ​​

392
00:14:18,908 --> 00:14:23,246
​​​ ​Should really be worrying about themselves​ ​​

393
00:14:18,908 --> 00:14:20,510
​​​ ​It goes, like, N-M-O-P.​ ​​

394
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:23,246
​​​ ​It goes so fast that​ ​​
​​ ​you're bound to mix something up.​ ​​

395
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,915
​​​ ​Once again, sorry for the wait.​ ​​

396
00:14:25,915 --> 00:14:28,518
​​​ ​We're back!​ ​​
​​ ​Once again, sorry for the wait.​ ​​

397
00:14:28,518 --> 00:14:30,820
​​​ ​This next question is​ ​​

398
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,155
​​​ ​fairly easy?​ ​​

399
00:14:32,155 --> 00:14:33,456
​​​ ​We think it's easy.​ ​​

400
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:34,691
​​​ ​Is it?​ ​​
​​ ​Yes.​ ​​

401
00:14:34,891 --> 00:14:35,525
​​​ ​Bam!​ ​​

402
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:40,129
​​​ ​Which letter comes after N in the alphabet?​ ​​

403
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,064
​​​ ​Which is it?​ ​​
​​ ​Which letter comes after N in the alphabet?​ ​​

404
00:14:41,064 --> 00:14:43,600
​​​ ​You're putting Kiara-chan​ ​​
​​ ​at an advantage again.​ ​​

405
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,501
​​​ ​No no no no no.​ ​​
​​ ​We're putting Kiara-chan at an advantage?!​ ​​

406
00:14:45,501 --> 00:14:46,736
​​​ ​Are you serious?!​ ​​

407
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:53,009
​​​ ​N​ ​​

408
00:14:51,174 --> 00:14:53,009
​​​ ​n​ ​​

409
00:14:51,574 --> 00:14:53,009
​​​ ​n...​ ​​

410
00:14:53,009 --> 00:14:55,745
​​​ ​Wait, she sounds unsure.​ ​​

411
00:14:55,745 --> 00:14:57,680
​​​ ​It's N, M, L, right?​ ​​

412
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,248
​​​ ​N, M, L, O, P...​ ​​

413
00:14:58,248 --> 00:14:58,815
​​​ ​N, M, L, O, P...​ ​​

414
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,515
​​​ ​N, M, L, O, P...​ ​​

415
00:14:59,515 --> 00:15:00,016
​​​ ​N, M, L, O, P...​ ​​

416
00:15:00,016 --> 00:15:00,717
​​​ ​N, M, L, O, P...​ ​​

417
00:15:00,717 --> 00:15:03,419
​​​ ​O, P, and then Q, R, S, T, U, right?​ ​​

418
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:07,023
​​​ ​I think they wrote down their answers,​ ​​

419
00:15:07,023 --> 00:15:09,058
​​​ ​so let's go take a look.​ ​​

420
00:15:09,058 --> 00:15:10,827
​​​ ​How did it go?​ ​​

421
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,462
​​​ ​Did you find the answer?​ ​​

422
00:15:12,462 --> 00:15:13,363
​​​ ​Yes!​ ​​
​​ ​We did!​ ​​

423
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:17,166
​​​ ​Then let's start off with Kiara-chan's.​ ​​

424
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,735
​​​ ​By all means, go ahead!​ ​​

425
00:15:18,735 --> 00:15:21,337
​​​ ​Here it... is!​ ​​

426
00:15:22,138 --> 00:15:25,241
​​​ ​O?!​ ​​
​​ ​That's an... O.​ ​​

427
00:15:25,241 --> 00:15:26,776
​​​ ​What? It's O?​ ​​

428
00:15:26,976 --> 00:15:29,979
​​​ ​Wait, I'm losing my confidence!​ ​​

429
00:15:29,979 --> 00:15:32,248
​​​ ​No way. Is it O?​ ​​

430
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:34,217
​​​ ​It's O, it's O.​ ​​

431
00:15:34,217 --> 00:15:34,717
​​​ ​Is it really O?​ ​​

432
00:15:34,717 --> 00:15:35,919
​​​ ​What?!​ ​​
​​ ​Is it really O?​ ​​

433
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:38,087
​​​ ​Oh no.​ ​​
​​ ​I'm feeling super unsure right now...​ ​​

434
00:15:38,087 --> 00:15:39,923
​​​ ​Mel-senpai, what's your answer?​ ​​

435
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,424
​​​ ​It's M.​ ​​

436
00:15:42,292 --> 00:15:44,427
​​​ ​She answered M.​ ​​

437
00:15:44,427 --> 00:15:45,795
​​​ ​Wait, I'm lost!​ ​​

438
00:15:45,795 --> 00:15:47,797
​​​ ​I don't know what it is anymore.​ ​​

439
00:15:47,797 --> 00:15:50,667
​​​ ​So we have an M and an O.​ ​​

440
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:52,802
​​​ ​What do you mean,​ ​​
​​ ​you don't know anymore, Lamy-senpai?​ ​​

441
00:15:52,802 --> 00:15:54,404
​​​ ​Ah, don't mind that. It's nothing.​ ​​
​​ ​What do you mean,​ ​​
​​ ​you don't know anymore, Lamy-senpai?​ ​​

442
00:15:54,404 --> 00:15:56,572
​​​ ​I thought it's M.​ ​​

443
00:15:56,572 --> 00:16:01,277
​​​ ​So did I, but I'm not sure anymore...​ ​​

444
00:16:01,277 --> 00:16:03,279
​​​ ​So what's the result?​ ​​

445
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,148
​​​ ​Did someone get it right?​ ​​

446
00:16:05,148 --> 00:16:07,183
​​​ ​Here's the answer!​ ​​

447
00:16:07,183 --> 00:16:14,724
​​​ ​Correct answer: O​ ​​

448
00:16:07,483 --> 00:16:09,385
​​​ ​What?!​ ​​

449
00:16:09,786 --> 00:16:11,321
​​​ ​No way!​ ​​

450
00:16:12,588 --> 00:16:14,023
​​​ ​How?!​ ​​

451
00:16:14,924 --> 00:16:17,460
​​​ ​That song misled me!​ ​​

452
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,195
​​​ ​What the heck?!​ ​​

453
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:28,838
​​​ ​It's true!​ ​​

454
00:16:29,772 --> 00:16:32,942
​​​ ​It's L, M, N, O, P.​ ​​

455
00:16:32,942 --> 00:16:34,410
​​​ ​L... M... N...​ ​​

456
00:16:36,312 --> 00:16:38,815
​​​ ​Did we mix up M and N?​ ​​

457
00:16:38,815 --> 00:16:40,683
​​​ ​That's hololive for you​ ​​

458
00:16:40,683 --> 00:16:43,886
​​​ ​This means only Kiara got it right!​ ​​

459
00:16:47,223 --> 00:16:52,328
​​​ ​Get correct answers from both​ ​​
​​ ​Manipulation failed!​ ​​

460
00:16:48,157 --> 00:16:49,125
​​​ ​I wonder if the editors could cut this part.​ ​​

461
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:52,328
​​​ ​Let's ask them to cut it, yeah.​ ​​
​​ ​I wonder if the editors could cut this part.​ ​​

462
00:16:52,328 --> 00:16:53,997
​​​ ​You were joking about Mel-senpai failing​ ​​

463
00:16:53,997 --> 00:16:55,198
​​​ ​but now three of us actually did.​ ​​

464
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:57,066
​​​ ​We're such an embarrassment!​ ​​

465
00:16:57,066 --> 00:16:58,468
​​​ ​No kidding.​ ​​

466
00:16:58,468 --> 00:17:00,536
​​​ ​Let's make the last question​ ​​
​​ ​a good one at least.​ ​​

467
00:17:00,536 --> 00:17:03,339
​​​ ​What's our goal this time?​ ​​

468
00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:05,041
​​​ ​Here it is.​ ​​

469
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:11,180
​​​ ​Get a correct answer from only Mel!​ ​​

470
00:17:05,675 --> 00:17:08,745
​​​ ​Oh boy, it's back.​ ​​

471
00:17:08,745 --> 00:17:11,180
​​​ ​She's like the final boss of this game.​ ​​

472
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:11,981
​​​ ​The thing is,​ ​​

473
00:17:11,981 --> 00:17:14,384
​​​ ​the biggest challenge is that Kiara is smart.​ ​​

474
00:17:14,384 --> 00:17:16,786
​​​ ​Yeah, you're right.​ ​​
​​ ​the biggest challenge is that Kiara is smart.​ ​​

475
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:19,455
​​​ ​How about being a bit adventurous​ ​​
​​ ​for this last one?​ ​​

476
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,391
​​​ ​Like a question with a picture.​ ​​
​​ ​We haven't done that yet.​ ​​

477
00:17:21,391 --> 00:17:24,660
​​​ ​Will Mel-Mel manage that, though?​ ​​

478
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,162
​​​ ​Take #13 for example.​ ​​

479
00:17:26,562 --> 00:17:29,198
​​​ ​"What statue is this?"​ ​​

480
00:17:29,198 --> 00:17:30,933
​​​ ​What was...​ ​​

481
00:17:30,933 --> 00:17:33,503
​​​ ​What was it called again?​ ​​

482
00:17:33,503 --> 00:17:34,971
​​​ ​It's not a pyramid, but...​ ​​

483
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,472
​​​ ​a sphinx.​ ​​
​​ ​The Sphinx!​ ​​

484
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,774
​​​ ​It's the Sphinx!​ ​​

485
00:17:37,774 --> 00:17:40,443
​​​ ​This is the Sphinx!​ ​​

486
00:17:40,443 --> 00:17:42,779
​​​ ​But wouldn't Kiara know this one too?​ ​​

487
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:44,347
​​​ ​You're right, the whole world knows it.​ ​​

488
00:17:44,347 --> 00:17:45,481
​​​ ​In that case...​ ​​

489
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,450
​​​ ​#24 or something.​ ​​
​​ ​How about #24?​ ​​

490
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:48,651
​​​ ​The one that says "Where is this?"​ ​​

491
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:51,320
​​​ ​The "Where is this?" one.​ ​​
​​ ​The one that says "Where is this?"​ ​​

492
00:17:51,888 --> 00:17:52,221
​​​ ​Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Where is that?​ ​​

493
00:17:52,221 --> 00:17:52,555
​​​ ​Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Where is that?​ ​​

494
00:17:52,555 --> 00:17:52,855
​​​ ​Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Where is that?​ ​​

495
00:17:52,855 --> 00:17:53,222
​​​ ​Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Where is that?​ ​​

496
00:17:53,222 --> 00:17:54,157
​​​ ​Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Where is that?​ ​​

497
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:54,757
​​​ ​Where is that?​ ​​

498
00:17:54,757 --> 00:17:55,591
​​​ ​Where is that?​ ​​

499
00:17:55,591 --> 00:17:57,727
​​​ ​(The Japanese historic village of)​ ​​
​​ ​Shirakawa-go?​ ​​

500
00:17:57,727 --> 00:17:58,494
​​​ ​No way it's that!​ ​​

501
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,196
​​​ ​They're probably insulted now.​ ​​

502
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:04,033
​​​ ​Now I want to know​ ​​
​​ ​Mel-senpai's answer for this.​ ​​

503
00:18:04,033 --> 00:18:08,204
​​​ ​We might have to cut it​ ​​
​​ ​depending on what she says.​ ​​

504
00:18:08,204 --> 00:18:10,206
​​​ ​But anyway, we might as well​ ​​
​​ ​give it a try, despite the risk.​ ​​

505
00:18:10,206 --> 00:18:13,843
​​​ ​Despite the risk.​ ​​
​​ ​It's the last one after all.​ ​​

506
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:17,113
​​​ ​Here we are again!​ ​​
​​ ​We're back!​ ​​

507
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,550
​​​ ​We have come to you with​ ​​

508
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,585
​​​ ​the final boss of quiz questions!​ ​​

509
00:18:22,585 --> 00:18:24,420
​​​ ​Well then.​ ​​

510
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,090
​​​ ​We shall now present it to you.​ ​​

511
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:28,257
​​​ ​Here it is!​ ​​

512
00:18:28,257 --> 00:18:29,258
​​​ ​Bam!​ ​​

513
00:18:30,193 --> 00:18:32,695
​​​ ​Where is this?​ ​​

514
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:33,796
​​​ ​Where is this?​ ​​

515
00:18:33,796 --> 00:18:34,664
​​​ ​Where is this?​ ​​

516
00:18:34,664 --> 00:18:35,965
​​​ ​Where is this?​ ​​

517
00:18:35,965 --> 00:18:37,266
​​​ ​Where is this?!​ ​​

518
00:18:40,436 --> 00:18:41,204
​​​ ​Actually,​ ​​

519
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:42,338
​​​ ​I've seen this before.​ ​​

520
00:18:42,338 --> 00:18:43,406
​​​ ​You have?​ ​​

521
00:18:43,406 --> 00:18:44,874
​​​ ​You have!​ ​​

522
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,943
​​​ ​It's definitely not in Japan.​ ​​

523
00:18:47,477 --> 00:18:49,979
​​​ ​It's surrounded by mountains...​ ​​

524
00:18:49,979 --> 00:18:52,482
​​​ ​And it looks like some kind of ruin, right?​ ​​

525
00:18:52,482 --> 00:18:54,350
​​​ ​Like a ruin.​ ​​

526
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:57,053
​​​ ​Yeah, like a World Heritage Site.​ ​​

527
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:58,521
​​​ ​It's a World Heritage Site?​ ​​

528
00:18:58,521 --> 00:19:00,123
​​​ ​I think so.​ ​​

529
00:19:00,123 --> 00:19:03,559
​​​ ​It looks like they're done writing their answers.​ ​​

530
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,594
​​​ ​Have they finished?​ ​​

531
00:19:04,594 --> 00:19:08,364
​​​ ​Let's go and take a look, then.​ ​​

532
00:19:08,364 --> 00:19:09,532
​​​ ​Let's go!​ ​​

533
00:19:09,532 --> 00:19:11,667
​​​ ​Can you hear us?​ ​​

534
00:19:11,667 --> 00:19:14,403
​​​ ​How did it go?​ ​​

535
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,405
​​​ ​Are you feeling confident?​ ​​

536
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:19,375
​​​ ​Well, you can easily tell it's not in Japan.​ ​​

537
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,512
​​​ ​You look so proud saying that.​ ​​

538
00:19:22,512 --> 00:19:25,348
​​​ ​That doesn't narrow it down​ ​​
​​ ​very much, does it?​ ​​

539
00:19:25,348 --> 00:19:29,085
​​​ ​Let's start with Mel-senpai this time.​ ​​

540
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:30,253
​​​ ​Here's her answer!​ ​​

541
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:35,791
​​​ ​burial mound​ ​​

542
00:19:31,053 --> 00:19:32,388
​​​ ​"Burial mound"!​ ​​

543
00:19:32,388 --> 00:19:33,756
​​​ ​Burial mound?​ ​​

544
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:35,791
​​​ ​A straightforward "burial mound."​ ​​

545
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:38,728
​​​ ​So we have one rather unspecific answer.​ ​​

546
00:19:38,728 --> 00:19:41,931
​​​ ​Let's take a look at Kiara's next.​ ​​

547
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:42,598
​​​ ​Here it is!​ ​​

548
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:47,503
​​​ ​"Machu Picchu in Peru."​ ​​

549
00:19:47,503 --> 00:19:48,838
​​​ ​Peru!​ ​​

550
00:19:48,838 --> 00:19:50,239
​​​ ​Peru!​ ​​

551
00:19:50,239 --> 00:19:51,440
​​​ ​Isn't it just "Machu Picchu"?​ ​​

552
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,742
​​​ ​Is this Machu Picchu?​ ​​

553
00:19:52,742 --> 00:19:56,078
​​​ ​Peru is the country​ ​​
​​ ​and Machu Picchu is the place.​ ​​

554
00:19:56,879 --> 00:19:59,882
​​​ ​I've only ever heard it as "Machu Picchu."​ ​​

555
00:19:59,882 --> 00:20:00,249
​​​ ​Machu Picchu Machu Picchu Machu Picchu.​ ​​

556
00:20:00,249 --> 00:20:00,917
​​​ ​Machu Picchu Machu Picchu Machu Picchu.​ ​​

557
00:20:00,917 --> 00:20:01,450
​​​ ​Machu Picchu Machu Picchu Machu Picchu.​ ​​

558
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,986
​​​ ​Pretty clear, isn't it?​ ​​

559
00:20:03,986 --> 00:20:08,090
​​​ ​Well then, did anyone get it right?​ ​​

560
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:10,326
​​​ ​This is the correct answer!​ ​​

561
00:20:10,326 --> 00:20:17,900
​​​ ​Correct answer: Machu Picchu​ ​​

562
00:20:11,494 --> 00:20:14,297
​​​ ​It's Machu Picchu!​ ​​
​​ ​Wow!​ ​​

563
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:14,630
​​​ ​You're out of control, Kiara!​ ​​

564
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,900
​​​ ​Nice, I got it.​ ​​
​​ ​You're out of control, Kiara!​ ​​

565
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:23,573
​​​ ​Machu Picchu: Ancient ruin of an Inca citadel.​ ​​
​​ ​Also called the "City in the Clouds." World Heritage Site.​ ​​

566
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,236
​​​ ​It says here that it's a World Heritage Site.​ ​​

567
00:20:20,236 --> 00:20:21,938
​​​ ​And that it's the ruin of a city.​ ​​

568
00:20:21,938 --> 00:20:23,573
​​​ ​I see!​ ​​

569
00:20:23,573 --> 00:20:25,341
​​​ ​Kiara, I'm impressed!​ ​​

570
00:20:25,341 --> 00:20:26,776
​​​ ​Amazing!​ ​​
​​ ​Kiara, I'm impressed!​ ​​

571
00:20:26,776 --> 00:20:31,280
​​​ ​I should thank you for picking this question.​ ​​

572
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,115
​​​ ​You wanted to make it easy for us, right?​ ​​

573
00:20:33,115 --> 00:20:39,989
​​​ ​Get a correct answer from only Mel​ ​​
​​ ​Manipulation failed!​ ​​

574
00:20:33,115 --> 00:20:36,152
​​​ ​Sure, we assumed you'd both know this one...​ ​​

575
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:39,989
​​​ ​But anyway, that was the last question!​ ​​

576
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:42,525
​​​ ​End of Quiz​ ​​

577
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:42,525
​​​ ​Thanks for participating!​ ​​
​​ ​Thank you!​ ​​

578
00:20:42,892 --> 00:20:47,630
​​​ ​You know, this whole time I've been​ ​​
​​ ​wondering what this quiz was for.​ ​​

579
00:20:48,531 --> 00:20:51,200
​​​ ​I guess you'd find it a bit suspicious...​ ​​

580
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,935
​​​ ​Let me explain.​ ​​

581
00:20:52,935 --> 00:20:55,404
​​​ ​Revealing the true nature of the quiz​ ​​

582
00:20:55,805 --> 00:20:59,709
​​​ ​Does that mean​ ​​
​​ ​you were playing around with us?​ ​​

583
00:20:59,709 --> 00:21:02,044
​​​ ​I wouldn't quite put it that way...​ ​​

584
00:21:02,044 --> 00:21:03,479
​​​ ​I feel bad now.​ ​​

585
00:21:03,479 --> 00:21:07,416
​​​ ​I'd like to be a manipulator next time.​ ​​

586
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:08,818
​​​ ​Seeing things from the other side?​ ​​

587
00:21:08,818 --> 00:21:12,688
​​​ ​It'd be fun to do this again​ ​​
​​ ​with other members, right?​ ​​

588
00:21:13,623 --> 00:21:15,625
