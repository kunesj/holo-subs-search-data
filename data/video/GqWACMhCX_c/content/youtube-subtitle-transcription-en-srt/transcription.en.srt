that in other pools
 

4137

01:43:18,470 --> 01:43:18,480
um my my advice my triceps uh hurt for
 

4161
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:20,450
um my my advice my triceps uh hurt for
days after

4162
01:43:20,450 --> 01:43:20,460
days after
 

4163
01:43:20,460 --> 01:43:24,109
days after
because I made an extras like big effort

4164
01:43:24,109 --> 01:43:24,119
because I made an extras like big effort
 

4165
01:43:24,119 --> 01:43:26,930
because I made an extras like big effort
to stay over the water because of the

4166
01:43:26,930 --> 01:43:26,940
to stay over the water because of the
 

4167
01:43:26,940 --> 01:43:29,229
to stay over the water because of the
strong waves

4168
01:43:29,229 --> 01:43:29,239
strong waves
 

4169
01:43:29,239 --> 01:43:32,649
strong waves
so I had to use way more muscle power

4170
01:43:32,649 --> 01:43:32,659
so I had to use way more muscle power
 

4171
01:43:32,659 --> 01:43:35,330
so I had to use way more muscle power
non-existent muscle power

non-existent muscle power
 

4173
01:43:35,340 --> 01:43:38,750

4175
01:43:38,760 --> 01:43:41,330

it needed more effort for me than usual

it needed more effort for me than usual
 

4177
01:43:41,340 --> 01:43:44,149

to stay over the water that's why my

6171
02:26:14,120 --> 02:26:17,750
like a
elimination process I think like we

6172
02:26:17,750 --> 02:26:17,760
elimination process I think like we
 

6173
02:26:17,760 --> 02:26:19,790
elimination process I think like we
didn't know at first what this was about

6174
02:26:19,790 --> 02:26:19,800
didn't know at first what this was about
 

6175
02:26:19,800 --> 02:26:21,530
didn't know at first what this was about
how it works but like related we

6176
02:26:21,530 --> 02:26:21,540
how it works but like related we
 

6177
02:26:21,540 --> 02:26:23,990
how it works but like related we
understood that basically there's like

6178
02:26:23,990 --> 02:26:24,000
understood that basically there's like
 

6179
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,450
understood that basically there's like
couples they get like forced to be

6180
02:26:26,450 --> 02:26:26,460
couples they get like forced to be
 

6181
02:26:26,460 --> 02:26:28,910

together with and like mixed and mingled

together with and like mixed and mingled
 

6183
02:26:28,920 --> 02:26:31,790
together with and like mixed and mingled
and eventually I guess you you you stick

6184
02:26:31,790 --> 02:26:31,800
and eventually I guess you you you stick
 

6185
02:26:31,800 --> 02:26:34,490
and eventually I guess you you you stick
with someone and then they eliminate

6186
02:26:34,490 --> 02:26:34,500
with someone and then they eliminate
 

6187
02:26:34,500 --> 02:26:37,010
with someone and then they eliminate
each other depending on what these

02:26:37,010 --> 02:26:37,020
each other depending on what these
 

6189
02:26:37,020 --> 02:26:38,929

9568
03:41:25,010 --> 03:41:25,020
we would have been uh like four to five
 

9569
03:41:25,020 --> 03:41:27,170
we would have been uh like four to five
hours early for the flight eventually

9570
03:41:27,170 --> 03:41:27,180
hours early for the flight eventually
 

9571
03:41:27,180 --> 03:41:30,110
hours early for the flight eventually
like more like five hours because they

9572
03:41:30,110 --> 03:41:30,120
like more like five hours because they
 

9573
03:41:30,120 --> 03:41:32,030
like more like five hours because they
didn't even start at the final delay

9574
03:41:32,030 --> 03:41:32,040
didn't even start at the final delay
 

9575
03:41:32,040 --> 03:41:35,510
didn't even start at the final delay
time they needed even more time it would

9576
03:41:35,510 --> 03:41:35,520
time they needed even more time it would
 

9577
03:41:35,520 --> 03:41:37,130
time they needed even more time it would
have been way too early so obviously you

9578
03:41:37,130 --> 03:41:37,140
have been way too early so obviously you
 

9579
03:41:37,140 --> 03:41:39,170
have been way too early so obviously you
don't go there that early right

9580
03:41:39,170 --> 03:41:39,180
don't go there that early right
 

9581
03:41:39,180 --> 03:41:41,510
don't go there that early right
we just waited until a more appropriate

9582
03:41:41,510 --> 03:41:41,520
we just waited until a more appropriate
 

9583
03:41:41,520 --> 03:41:42,950
we just waited until a more appropriate
time

9584
03:41:42,950 --> 03:41:42,960
time
 

9585
03:41:42,960 --> 03:41:44,690
time
because the airport is not a nice place

9586
03:41:44,690 --> 03:41:44,700
because the airport is not a nice place
 

9587
03:41:44,700 --> 03:41:46,010
because the airport is not a nice place
to be

9588
03:41:46,010 --> 03:41:46,020
to be
 

9589
03:41:46,020 --> 03:41:50,929
to be
uh finally it was like a normal time so

9590
03:41:50,929 --> 03:41:50,939
uh finally it was like a normal time so
 

9591
03:41:50,939 --> 03:41:53,150
uh finally it was like a normal time so
we made our way to the airport and we

9592
03:41:53,150 --> 03:41:53,160
we made our way to the airport and we
 

9593
03:41:53,160 --> 03:41:55,790
we made our way to the airport and we
would have still been there like one and

9594
03:41:55,790 --> 03:41:55,800
would have still been there like one and
 

9595
03:41:55,800 --> 03:41:57,469
would have still been there like one and
a half to two hours early

9596
03:41:57,469 --> 03:41:57,479
a half to two hours early
 

9597

um
 

9599
03:41:58,920 --> 03:42:01,429
um
and which is plenty

9600
03:42:01,429 --> 03:42:01,439
and which is plenty
 

9601
03:42:01,439 --> 03:42:05,870
and which is plenty
and then in the air in the in the train

9602
03:42:05,870 --> 03:42:05,880
and then in the air in the in the train
 

9603
03:42:05,880 --> 03:42:08,349
and then in the air in the in the train
uh you know we find some information

9604
03:42:08,349 --> 03:42:08,359
uh you know we find some information
 

9605
03:42:08,359 --> 03:42:10,750
uh you know we find some information
that implies

9606
03:42:10,750 --> 03:42:10,760
that implies
 

9607
03:42:10,760 --> 03:42:13,610
that implies
that even if it's delayed by whatever

9608
03:42:13,610 --> 03:42:13,620
that even if it's delayed by whatever
 

9609

03:42:23,630 --> 03:42:23,640
at the original time
 

9615
03:42:23,640 --> 03:42:26,210
at the original time
like originally intended

9616
03:42:26,210 --> 03:42:26,220

9619
03:42:28,859 --> 03:42:31,370
check-in time
and we were like what

9620
03:42:31,370 --> 03:42:31,380
and we were like what
 

9621
03:42:31,380 --> 03:42:33,590
and we were like what
