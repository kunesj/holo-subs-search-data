we're actually doing like team stuff if

9052
04:35:51,949 --> 04:35:51,959
we're actually doing like team stuff if
 

9053
04:35:51,959 --> 04:35:54,051
we're actually doing like team stuff if
if I really should be doing if I really

9054

if I really should be doing if I really
 

9055
04:35:54,061 --> 04:35:56,330
if I really should be doing if I really
should be putting so much work into my

04:35:56,330 --> 04:35:56,340
should be putting so much work into my
 

9057
04:35:56,340 --> 04:35:57,789
should be putting so much work into my

04:36:01,439 --> 04:36:04,429

04:36:04,429 --> 04:36:04,439
team versus team will happen probably
 

9063
04:36:04,439 --> 04:36:06,709
team versus team will happen probably
somewhere on an empty field or or will

9064
04:36:06,709 --> 04:36:06,719
somewhere on an empty field or or will
 

9065
04:36:06,719 --> 04:36:08,449
somewhere on an empty field or or will
happen with some buildings that we built

9066
04:36:08,449 --> 04:36:08,459
happen with some buildings that we built
 

9067
04:36:08,459 --> 04:36:11,209
happen with some buildings that we built
specifically for that or so

9068
04:36:11,209 --> 04:36:11,219
specifically for that or so
 

9069
04:36:11,219 --> 04:36:12,769
specifically for that or so
so that's why I'm not sure if I actually

9070
04:36:12,769 --> 04:36:12,779
so that's why I'm not sure if I actually
 

9071
04:36:12,779 --> 04:36:15,349
so that's why I'm not sure if I actually
really commit to that maybe just for

04:36:15,349 --> 04:36:15,359
really commit to that maybe just for

but I can stream even more I could I
could

10144
05:07:01,368 --> 05:07:01,378
could
 

10145
05:07:01,378 --> 05:07:03,288
could
but you know I'm always trying to

10146
05:07:03,288 --> 05:07:03,298
but you know I'm always trying to
 

10147
05:07:03,298 --> 05:07:05,030
but you know I'm always trying to
balance

10148
05:07:05,030 --> 05:07:05,040
balance

so even though I could stream more the

10152

so even though I could stream more the
 

10153
05:07:11,280 --> 05:07:12,948
so even though I could stream more the
question is is it smart to stream

question is is it smart to stream
 

10155
05:07:12,958 --> 05:07:14,810

10253
05:09:24,200 --> 05:09:25,270

what

10254
05:09:25,270 --> 05:09:25,280
what
 

10255
05:09:25,280 --> 05:09:27,070
what
[Laughter]

10256
05:09:27,070 --> 05:09:27,080
[Laughter]
 

10257
05:09:27,080 --> 05:09:34,330
[Laughter]
below 0.0 I'm making a living out of it

10258
05:09:34,330 --> 05:09:34,340

 

10259
05:09:34,340 --> 05:09:37,310

that means even there's an insane amount

10260
05:09:37,310 --> 05:09:37,320
that means even there's an insane amount
 

10261
05:09:37,320 --> 05:09:39,470
that means even there's an insane amount
of streamers on Twitch

10262
05:09:39,470 --> 05:09:39,480
of streamers on Twitch
 

10263
05:09:39,480 --> 05:09:42,770
of streamers on Twitch
or it's just really not

10264
05:09:42,770 --> 05:09:42,780
or it's just really not
 

10265
05:09:42,780 --> 05:09:45,350
or it's just really not
not a good source of income

10266
05:09:45,350 --> 05:09:45,360
not a good source of income
 

10267
05:09:45,360 --> 05:09:47,930
not a good source of income
but I wonder they probably don't count

10268
05:09:47,930 --> 05:09:47,940
but I wonder they probably don't count
 

10269
05:09:47,940 --> 05:09:50,510
but I wonder they probably don't count
sponsorships and and merchandise don't

10270
05:09:50,510 --> 05:09:50,520
sponsorships and and merchandise don't
 

10271
05:09:50,520 --> 05:09:52,430
sponsorships and and merchandise don't
do that I'm not sure if they count that

10272
05:09:52,430 --> 05:09:52,440
do that I'm not sure if they count that
 

10273
05:09:52,440 --> 05:09:55,430
do that I'm not sure if they count that
because from what I know a lot of

10274
05:09:55,430 --> 05:09:55,440
because from what I know a lot of
 

10275
05:09:55,440 --> 05:09:56,628
because from what I know a lot of
tourist streamers make a lot of money

10276
05:09:56,628 --> 05:09:56,638
tourist streamers make a lot of money
 

10277
05:09:56,638 --> 05:09:59,810
tourist streamers make a lot of money
from merchandise too right

10278
05:09:59,810 --> 05:09:59,820
from merchandise too right
 

10279
05:09:59,820 --> 05:10:02,990
from merchandise too right
they do

10280
05:10:02,990 --> 05:10:03,000

 

10281
05:10:03,000 --> 05:10:05,868

they probably don't

10282
05:10:05,868 --> 05:10:05,878

 

10283
05:10:05,878 --> 05:10:09,230

I wonder

10284
05:10:09,230 --> 05:10:09,240

 

10285
05:10:09,240 --> 05:10:11,690

yeah there's definitely an insane amount

10286
05:10:11,690 --> 05:10:11,700
yeah there's definitely an insane amount
 

10287
05:10:11,700 --> 05:10:14,590
yeah there's definitely an insane amount
of streamers though it's boom so much

10288
05:10:14,590 --> 05:10:14,600
of streamers though it's boom so much
 

10289
05:10:14,600 --> 05:10:18,288
of streamers though it's boom so much
and yeah burnout is easy like

10290
05:10:18,288 --> 05:10:18,298
and yeah burnout is easy like
 

10291
05:10:18,298 --> 05:10:21,288
and yeah burnout is easy like
because it does it does like pressure

10292
05:10:21,288 --> 05:10:21,298
because it does it does like pressure
 

10293
05:10:21,298 --> 05:10:24,110
because it does it does like pressure

10296
05:10:27,770 --> 05:10:27,780
make it in that industry
 

10297
05:10:27,780 --> 05:10:30,110
make it in that industry
yeah you put a lot of pressure on

10298
05:10:30,110 --> 05:10:30,120
yeah you put a lot of pressure on
 

10299
05:10:30,120 --> 05:10:31,490
yeah you put a lot of pressure on
yourself

10300
05:10:31,490 --> 05:10:31,500

you have to because it's really hard
 

10303
05:10:34,378 --> 05:10:36,410
you have to because it's really hard
to be relevant

10304
05:10:36,410 --> 05:10:36,420
to be relevant
 

10305
05:10:36,420 --> 05:10:40,070
to be relevant
and make a good amount of money from it

10306
05:10:40,070 --> 05:10:40,080
and make a good amount of money from it
 

10307
05:10:40,080 --> 05:10:42,948
and make a good amount of money from it
um

10308
05:10:42,948 --> 05:10:42,958

 

10309
05:10:42,958 --> 05:10:45,650

so

10310
05:10:45,650 --> 05:10:45,660

 

10311
05:10:45,660 --> 05:10:48,010

you know I might be streaming

10312
05:10:48,010 --> 05:10:48,020
you know I might be streaming
 

10313
05:10:48,020 --> 05:10:51,948
you know I might be streaming
comparably a lot but

10314
05:10:51,948 --> 05:10:51,958
comparably a lot but
 

10315
05:10:51,958 --> 05:10:55,430
comparably a lot but
to like the rest of Ian but

10316
05:10:55,430 --> 05:10:55,440
to like the rest of Ian but
 

10317
05:10:55,440 --> 05:10:59,448
to like the rest of Ian but
I think it's it's good to stream less

10318
05:10:59,448 --> 05:10:59,458
I think it's it's good to stream less
 

10319
05:10:59,458 --> 05:11:02,030
I think it's it's good to stream less
like it's it's definitely good for your

10320
05:11:02,030 --> 05:11:02,040
like it's it's definitely good for your
 

10321
05:11:02,040 --> 05:11:04,310
like it's it's definitely good for your
mental health and all that and to not be

10322
05:11:04,310 --> 05:11:04,320
mental health and all that and to not be
 

10323
05:11:04,320 --> 05:11:09,830
mental health and all that and to not be
burnt out

10324
05:11:09,830 --> 05:11:09,840

 

10325
05:11:09,840 --> 05:11:12,170

just because someone streams more than

10326
05:11:12,170 --> 05:11:12,180
just because someone streams more than
 

10327
05:11:12,180 --> 05:11:14,208
just because someone streams more than
others doesn't mean that they're a

10328
05:11:14,208 --> 05:11:14,218
others doesn't mean that they're a
 

10329
05:11:14,218 --> 05:11:16,310
others doesn't mean that they're a
better streamer

10330
05:11:16,310 --> 05:11:16,320
better streamer
 

10331
05:11:16,320 --> 05:11:19,510
better streamer
that's that's the thing

10332
05:11:19,510 --> 05:11:19,520
that's that's the thing
 

10333
05:11:19,520 --> 05:11:21,530
that's that's the thing
it's just

10334
05:11:21,530 --> 05:11:21,540
it's just
 

10335
05:11:21,540 --> 05:11:23,990
it's just
different ways of

10336
05:11:23,990 --> 05:11:24,000
different ways of
 

10337
05:11:24,000 --> 05:11:26,030
different ways of
different ways of doing it and there's

10338
05:11:26,030 --> 05:11:26,040
different ways of doing it and there's
 

10339
05:11:26,040 --> 05:11:28,010
different ways of doing it and there's
no right way of doing it

10340
05:11:28,010 --> 05:11:28,020
no right way of doing it
 

10341
05:11:28,020 --> 05:11:30,948
no right way of doing it
as a streamer it doesn't mean that you

10342
05:11:30,948 --> 05:11:30,958
as a streamer it doesn't mean that you
 

10343
05:11:30,958 --> 05:11:33,830
as a streamer it doesn't mean that you
have to stream a certain amount of

10344
05:11:33,830 --> 05:11:33,840
have to stream a certain amount of
 

10345
05:11:33,840 --> 05:11:40,010
have to stream a certain amount of
hours per day to be a good streamer

10346
05:11:40,010 --> 05:11:40,020

 

10347
05:11:40,020 --> 05:11:42,230

you know those those standards may have

10348
05:11:42,230 --> 05:11:42,240
you know those those standards may have
 

10349
05:11:42,240 --> 05:11:44,330
you know those those standards may have
been set somehow and now the

10350
05:11:44,330 --> 05:11:44,340
been set somehow and now the
 

10351
05:11:44,340 --> 05:11:47,208
been set somehow and now the
expectations are so high but in the end

10352
05:11:47,208 --> 05:11:47,218
expectations are so high but in the end
 

10353
05:11:47,218 --> 05:11:49,250
expectations are so high but in the end

I don't think that's only twitch
streamers

10428
05:13:23,090 --> 05:13:23,100
streamers
 

10429
05:13:23,100 --> 05:13:25,310

10433
05:13:27,180 --> 05:13:29,330
kind of Lucky it's not the best example
like even when someone in her life takes

10434
05:13:29,330 --> 05:13:29,340
like even when someone in her life takes
 

10435
05:13:29,340 --> 05:13:31,788
like even when someone in her life takes
a one month break or so and they come

10436
05:13:31,788 --> 05:13:31,798
a one month break or so and they come
 

10437
05:13:31,798 --> 05:13:32,570
a one month break or so and they come
back

10438
05:13:32,570 --> 05:13:32,580
back
 

10439
05:13:32,580 --> 05:13:34,910
back
they usually just go back to normal and

10440
05:13:34,910 --> 05:13:34,920
they usually just go back to normal and
 

10441
05:13:34,920 --> 05:13:37,250
they usually just go back to normal and
have a nice big welcome and go back to

05:13:37,250 --> 05:13:37,260
have a nice big welcome and go back to

have a nice big welcome and go back to
normal

normal
 

10445
05:13:38,040 --> 05:13:40,010
normal
thankfully but I think in general it's

10446
05:13:40,010 --> 05:13:40,020
thankfully but I think in general it's
 

10447
05:13:40,020 --> 05:13:41,868
thankfully but I think in general it's
not just twitch it's also YouTube

10448
05:13:41,868 --> 05:13:41,878
not just twitch it's also YouTube
 

10449
05:13:41,878 --> 05:13:44,030
not just twitch it's also YouTube
or wherever not only streaming also if

10450
05:13:44,030 --> 05:13:44,040
or wherever not only streaming also if
 

10451
05:13:44,040 --> 05:13:45,410
or wherever not only streaming also if
you just don't upload the video for a

05:13:45,410 --> 05:13:45,420
you just don't upload the video for a
 

10453
05:13:45,420 --> 05:13:46,788
you just don't upload the video for a
long time then the algorithm [\h__\h]

10454
05:13:46,788 --> 05:13:46,798
long time then the algorithm [\h__\h]
 

10455

10462
05:14:03,590 --> 05:14:03,600

 

10463
05:14:03,600 --> 05:14:06,770

I would still be worried about

10464
05:14:06,770 --> 05:14:06,780
I would still be worried about
 

10465
05:14:06,780 --> 05:14:09,490
I would still be worried about
taking such a long break though

10466
05:14:09,490 --> 05:14:09,500
taking such a long break though
 

10467
05:14:09,500 --> 05:14:13,930
taking such a long break though
I feel like I'm on a on a constant

10468
