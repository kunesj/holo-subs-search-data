518
00:15:21,069 --> 00:15:21,079
weekend but then if we do it on the
 

519
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:23,310

mining mining um let's

596
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:19,439
mining mining um let's
 

597
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,230
mining mining um let's
see on a sec trench into a three oh man

598
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:23,240
see on a sec trench into a three oh man
 

599
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,429
see on a sec trench into a three oh man
he's quick that's okay we'll figure it

600
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:25,439
he's quick that's okay we'll figure it
 

601
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,669
he's quick that's okay we'll figure it
out he's like he like goes into the

602
00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:27,679
out he's like he like goes into the
 

603
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,150
out he's like he like goes into the
ground so I I feel like we can't go into

604
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:30,160
ground so I I feel like we can't go into
 

605
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,669
ground so I I feel like we can't go into
the ground so I'm just gonna all right

606
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:33,679
the ground so I'm just gonna all right
 

607
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,750
the ground so I'm just gonna all right
calm that chill my dude 3

yeah that makes sense that um that
 

613
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:44,150
yeah that makes sense that um that
wouldn't work out and that's fine no

614
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:44,160
wouldn't work out and that's fine no

feel like it's maybe hard
 

855
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,750
feel like it's maybe hard
to sell because it's relatively

856
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:16,760
to sell because it's relatively
 

857
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:20,310
to sell because it's relatively
expensive and big and I see not

858
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:20,320
expensive and big and I see not

863
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:29,230

00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:29,240
selling so well but it's not really my
 

865
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,510
selling so well but it's not really my
decision if they think that I should do

866
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:31,520
decision if they think that I should do
 

867
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,950
decision if they think that I should do
one and they think it would sell well

over here though is the

5132
02:06:29,069 --> 02:06:29,079
over here though is the
 

5133
02:06:29,079 --> 02:06:31,629
over here though is the
thing not sure what how where the boat

5134
02:06:31,629 --> 02:06:31,639
thing not sure what how where the boat
 

5135
02:06:31,639 --> 02:06:33,229
thing not sure what how where the boat
is the boat what captures the zombie cuz

5136
02:06:33,229 --> 02:06:33,239
is the boat what captures the zombie cuz
 

5137
02:06:33,239 --> 02:06:35,030
is the boat what captures the zombie cuz
I think the zombie goes down these trap

5138
02:06:35,030 --> 02:06:35,040
I think the zombie goes down these trap
 

5139
02:06:35,040 --> 02:06:39,069
I think the zombie goes down these trap
doors and goes here and then they see

5140
02:06:39,069 --> 02:06:39,079
doors and goes here and then they see
 

5141
02:06:39,079 --> 02:06:41,310
doors and goes here and then they see
him but I just

5142
02:06:41,310 --> 02:06:41,320
him but I just
 

5143
02:06:41,320 --> 02:06:44,430
him but I just
don't if we move The

5144
02:06:44,430 --> 02:06:44,440
don't if we move The
 

5145

Boat Boat need to be at your side not

5146
02:06:47,310 --> 02:06:47,320
Boat Boat need to be at your side not
 

5147
02:06:47,320 --> 02:06:49,350
Boat Boat need to be at your side not
near a villager yeah guess cuz if it's

5148
02:06:49,350 --> 02:06:49,360
near a villager yeah guess cuz if it's
 

5149
02:06:49,360 --> 02:06:51,030
near a villager yeah guess cuz if it's
that close it would hurt the Villager

5150
02:06:51,030 --> 02:06:51,040
that close it would hurt the Villager
 

5151
02:06:51,040 --> 02:06:53,030
that close it would hurt the Villager
right exactly so what we do is for

5152
02:06:53,030 --> 02:06:53,040
right exactly so what we do is for
 

5153
02:06:53,040 --> 02:06:54,589
right exactly so what we do is for
example we need to be out of here and

5154
02:06:54,589 --> 02:06:54,599
example we need to be out of here and
 

5155
02:06:54,599 --> 02:06:56,709
example we need to be out of here and
then I guess I'll put the boat yeah so

5156
02:06:56,709 --> 02:06:56,719
then I guess I'll put the boat yeah so
 

5157
02:06:56,719 --> 02:07:00,069
then I guess I'll put the boat yeah so
I'll show you sorry over your head okay

5160
02:07:03,310 --> 02:07:03,320
here I think it's it's like
 

5161
02:07:03,320 --> 02:07:05,510
here I think it's it's like
this yeah yeah but what if the zombie

5162
02:07:05,510 --> 02:07:05,520
this yeah yeah but what if the zombie
 

5163
02:07:05,520 --> 02:07:08,149
this yeah yeah but what if the zombie
gets close to them you can remove the

5164
02:07:08,149 --> 02:07:08,159
gets close to them you can remove the
 

5165
02:07:08,159 --> 02:07:10,910
gets close to them you can remove the
boat for now turn off the light for

5166
02:07:10,910 --> 02:07:10,920
boat for now turn off the light for
 

5167
02:07:10,920 --> 02:07:12,950
boat for now turn off the light for
spawning them I think that that's

5168
02:07:12,950 --> 02:07:12,960
spawning them I think that that's
 

5169
02:07:12,960 --> 02:07:15,189
spawning them I think that that's
what's the zombie once it's in the boat

5170
02:07:15,189 --> 02:07:15,199
what's the zombie once it's in the boat
 

5171
02:07:15,199 --> 02:07:17,189
what's the zombie once it's in the boat
it will not move don't worry oh really

5172
02:07:17,189 --> 02:07:17,199
it will not move don't worry oh really
 

5173
02:07:17,199 --> 02:07:18,830
it will not move don't worry oh really

5177
02:07:21,760 --> 02:07:24,189

that I think if we just yeah make a
 

5179
02:07:24,199 --> 02:07:26,709
that I think if we just yeah make a
place with no torches right now yeah

02:08:13,119 --> 02:08:15,310
maybe yeah but uh where do you want to
do it up there I wonder what would be

5220
02:08:15,310 --> 02:08:15,320
do it up there I wonder what would be
 

5221
02:08:15,320 --> 02:08:17,589
do it up there I wonder what would be
best can zombies climb stairs would be

5222
02:08:17,589 --> 02:08:17,599
best can zombies climb stairs would be
 

5223
02:08:17,599 --> 02:08:18,549
best can zombies climb stairs would be
so

5224
02:08:18,549 --> 02:08:18,559
so
 

5225
02:08:18,559 --> 02:08:21,229
so
close no he he can't climb the stairs

5226
02:08:21,229 --> 02:08:21,239
close no he he can't climb the stairs
 

5227
02:08:21,239 --> 02:08:22,030
close no he he can't climb the stairs
but

5228
02:08:22,030 --> 02:08:22,040
but
 

5229
02:08:22,040 --> 02:08:24,229
but
if we spawn him up here I

5230
02:08:24,229 --> 02:08:24,239
if we spawn him up here I
 

5231
02:08:24,239 --> 02:08:26,669
if we spawn him up here I
guess I guess that could

5232
02:08:26,669 --> 02:08:26,679
guess I guess that could
 

5233
02:08:26,679 --> 02:08:28,629
guess I guess that could
work that would be best we get rid of

5234
02:08:28,629 --> 02:08:28,639
work that would be best we get rid of
 

5235
02:08:28,639 --> 02:08:30,750
work that would be best we get rid of
the Torches I feel like he might spawn

5236
02:08:30,750 --> 02:08:30,760
the Torches I feel like he might spawn
 

5237
02:08:30,760 --> 02:08:33,069
the Torches I feel like he might spawn

so keelly you being able to build this

5592
02:17:11,669 --> 02:17:11,679
so keelly you being able to build this
 

5593
02:17:11,679 --> 02:17:14,509
so keelly you being able to build this
kind of inspires me to also build

5594
02:17:14,509 --> 02:17:14,519
kind of inspires me to also build
 

5595
02:17:14,519 --> 02:17:17,549
kind of inspires me to also build
something like this sometime ah why I

5596
02:17:17,549 --> 02:17:17,559
something like this sometime ah why I
 

5597
02:17:17,559 --> 02:17:19,110
something like this sometime ah why I
just follow I'm just following the

5598
02:17:19,110 --> 02:17:19,120
just follow I'm just following the
 

5599
02:17:19,120 --> 02:17:22,270
just follow I'm just following the
tutorial but I to try and do something

5600
02:17:22,270 --> 02:17:22,280
tutorial but I to try and do something
 

5601
02:17:22,280 --> 02:17:24,309
tutorial but I to try and do something
where's the lava this is a non lava

where's the lava this is a non lava
build it's slower though I think with

5604
02:17:26,629 --> 02:17:26,639
build it's slower though I think with
 

5605
02:17:26,639 --> 02:17:28,230
build it's slower though I think with
the iron but that's okay I don't care if

5606
02:17:28,230 --> 02:17:28,240
the iron but that's okay I don't care if
 

5607
02:17:28,240 --> 02:17:29,830
the iron but that's okay I don't care if
it's sler

5608
02:17:29,830 --> 02:17:29,840
it's sler
 

5609
02:17:29,840 --> 02:17:32,910
it's sler
okay I just wanted it to work how our

5610

that what what like seven eh what what
does that mean so we should turn the

5658
02:18:35,589 --> 02:18:35,599
does that mean so we should turn the
 

5659
02:18:35,599 --> 02:18:37,750
does that mean so we should turn the
other areas void is spawn proof already

5660
02:18:37,750 --> 02:18:37,760
other areas void is spawn proof already
 

5661
02:18:37,760 --> 02:18:39,669
other areas void is spawn proof already
true like in that direction it should be

5662
02:18:39,669 --> 02:18:39,679
true like in that direction it should be
 

5663
02:18:39,679 --> 02:18:41,950
true like in that direction it should be
okay where there's only

5664
02:18:41,950 --> 02:18:41,960
okay where there's only
 

5665
02:18:41,960 --> 02:18:46,030
okay where there's only
sky this direction towards our island is

5666
02:18:46,030 --> 02:18:46,040
sky this direction towards our island is
 

5667
02:18:46,040 --> 02:18:49,469
sky this direction towards our island is
the problem maybe we'll fix it at night

5668
02:18:49,469 --> 02:18:49,479
the problem maybe we'll fix it at night
 

5669
02:18:49,479 --> 02:18:51,270
the problem maybe we'll fix it at night
time m

5670
02:18:51,270 --> 02:18:51,280
time m
 

5671
02:18:51,280 --> 02:18:54,790
time m
freaking babies man I swear to God I

freaking babies man I swear to God I
 

5673
02:18:54,800 --> 02:18:56,790
freaking babies man I swear to God I
can't let him tutorial first and then

5674
02:18:56,790 --> 02:18:56,800
can't let him tutorial first and then
 

5675
02:18:56,800 --> 02:18:59,070
can't let him tutorial first and then
fix yeah we'll just make it work once

5676
02:18:59,070 --> 02:18:59,080
fix yeah we'll just make it work once
 

5677
02:18:59,080 --> 02:19:00,950
fix yeah we'll just make it work once
and then we'll see if the Golem spawning

5678
02:19:00,950 --> 02:19:00,960
and then we'll see if the Golem spawning
 

5679
02:19:00,960 --> 02:19:03,589
and then we'll see if the Golem spawning
elsewhere is a problem for real yeah so

5680
02:19:03,589 --> 02:19:03,599
elsewhere is a problem for real yeah so
 

5681
02:19:03,599 --> 02:19:05,629
elsewhere is a problem for real yeah so
Cy you understood what they're saying

5682
02:19:05,629 --> 02:19:05,639
Cy you understood what they're saying
 

5683
02:19:05,639 --> 02:19:07,629
Cy you understood what they're saying
yeah I get it I understand they might

5684
02:19:07,629 --> 02:19:07,639
yeah I get it I understand they might
 

5685
02:19:07,639 --> 02:19:09,790
yeah I get it I understand they might
just spawn nearby instead of inside of

5686
02:19:09,790 --> 02:19:09,800
just spawn nearby instead of inside of
 

5687
02:19:09,800 --> 02:19:12,349
just spawn nearby instead of inside of
here here which is not what we want

5688
02:19:12,349 --> 02:19:12,359
here here which is not what we want
 

5689
02:19:12,359 --> 02:19:14,870
here here which is not what we want
yeah got make sure they can't spawn on

5690
02:19:14,870 --> 02:19:14,880
yeah got make sure they can't spawn on
 

5691
02:19:14,880 --> 02:19:18,309
yeah got make sure they can't spawn on
the yeah I get

5692
02:19:18,309 --> 02:19:18,319

 

5693
02:19:18,319 --> 02:19:20,389

it yeah you need to make everywhere

5694
02:19:20,389 --> 02:19:20,399
it yeah you need to make everywhere
 

5695
02:19:20,399 --> 02:19:22,429
it yeah you need to make everywhere
around not a place things are able to

5696
02:19:22,429 --> 02:19:22,439
around not a place things are able to
 

5697
02:19:22,439 --> 02:19:24,750
around not a place things are able to
spawn okay but like how far out when you

5698
02:19:24,750 --> 02:19:24,760
spawn okay but like how far out when you
 

5699
02:19:24,760 --> 02:19:26,709
spawn okay but like how far out when you
say 17 13

5700
02:19:26,709 --> 02:19:26,719
say 17 13
 

5701
02:19:26,719 --> 02:19:30,429
say 17 13
17 uh yeah that seems yes compated like

5702
02:19:30,429 --> 02:19:30,439
17 uh yeah that seems yes compated like
 

5703
02:19:30,439 --> 02:19:33,910
17 uh yeah that seems yes compated like
17 blocks in that direction or like

5704
02:19:33,910 --> 02:19:33,920
17 blocks in that direction or like
 

5705
02:19:33,920 --> 02:19:36,389
17 blocks in that direction or like
should they be slabs right I feel like

5706
02:19:36,389 --> 02:19:36,399
should they be slabs right I feel like
 

5707
02:19:36,399 --> 02:19:38,389
should they be slabs right I feel like
the reason that they did it that that

5708
02:19:38,389 --> 02:19:38,399
the reason that they did it that that
 

5709
02:19:38,399 --> 02:19:40,190
the reason that they did it that that
way in the tutorial is because of the

5710
02:19:40,190 --> 02:19:40,200
way in the tutorial is because of the
 

5711
02:19:40,200 --> 02:19:42,190
way in the tutorial is because of the
location of the villagers being exactly

5712
02:19:42,190 --> 02:19:42,200
location of the villagers being exactly
 

5713
02:19:42,200 --> 02:19:43,709
location of the villagers being exactly
where it is then this is exactly where

5714
02:19:43,709 --> 02:19:43,719
where it is then this is exactly where
 

5715
02:19:43,719 --> 02:19:47,910
where it is then this is exactly where
they would spawn but oh I don't know

5716
02:19:47,910 --> 02:19:47,920
they would spawn but oh I don't know
 

5717

tall oh
yeah it's fine figure it out you can

5720
02:19:54,710 --> 02:19:54,720
yeah it's fine figure it out you can
 

5721
02:19:54,720 --> 02:19:56,750
yeah it's fine figure it out you can
cover the area with

5722
02:19:56,750 --> 02:19:56,760
cover the area with
 

5723
02:19:56,760 --> 02:19:59,670
cover the area with
leaf and remove the beds
