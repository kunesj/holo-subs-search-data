453
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,329

it's not that easy you have to take all

3656
01:37:54,110 --> 01:37:54,120
it's not that easy you have to take all
 

3657
01:37:54,120 --> 01:37:57,530
it's not that easy you have to take all
of the finger trackers off

3658
01:37:57,530 --> 01:37:57,540
of the finger trackers off
 

3659
01:37:57,540 --> 01:38:01,490
of the finger trackers off
unless you want to be disgusting

3660
01:38:01,490 --> 01:38:01,500

 

3661
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:03,530

um and then you have to put them back on

3662
01:38:03,530 --> 01:38:03,540
um and then you have to put them back on
 

3663
01:38:03,540 --> 01:38:05,629
um and then you have to put them back on
and it takes quite a while

3664
01:38:05,629 --> 01:38:05,639
and it takes quite a while
 

3665
01:38:05,639 --> 01:38:07,850
and it takes quite a while
putting those finger trackers on takes

3666
01:38:07,850 --> 01:38:07,860
putting those finger trackers on takes
 

3667
01:38:07,860 --> 01:38:09,290
putting those finger trackers on takes
like

3668
01:38:09,290 --> 01:38:09,300
like
 

3669
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:10,970
like
I mean they're pretty faceted because

3670
01:38:10,970 --> 01:38:10,980
I mean they're pretty faceted because
 

3671
01:38:10,980 --> 01:38:12,649
I mean they're pretty faceted because
they're good and they're used to it and

3672
01:38:12,649 --> 01:38:12,659
they're good and they're used to it and
 

3673
01:38:12,659 --> 01:38:14,930
they're good and they're used to it and
they do it with like two people

3674
01:38:14,930 --> 01:38:14,940
they do it with like two people
 

3675
01:38:14,940 --> 01:38:17,270
they do it with like two people
so it takes like maybe

3676
01:38:17,270 --> 01:38:17,280
so it takes like maybe
 

3677
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:19,370
so it takes like maybe
five

3678
01:38:19,370 --> 01:38:19,380
five
 

3679
01:38:19,380 --> 01:38:21,830
five
five six minutes

3680
01:38:21,830 --> 01:38:21,840
five six minutes
 

3681
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:25,430
five six minutes
to take them to put them on

3682
01:38:25,430 --> 01:38:25,440
to take them to put them on
 

3683
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:27,530
to take them to put them on
but it's kind of like they're using some

3684
01:38:27,530 --> 01:38:27,540
but it's kind of like they're using some
 

3685
01:38:27,540 --> 01:38:29,629
but it's kind of like they're using some
kind of tape so taking them off also

3686
01:38:29,629 --> 01:38:29,639
kind of tape so taking them off also
 

3687
01:38:29,639 --> 01:38:34,370
kind of tape so taking them off also
takes like two minutes

3688
01:38:34,370 --> 01:38:34,380

 

3689
01:38:34,380 --> 01:38:36,290

I think it was memeing

3690
01:38:36,290 --> 01:38:36,300
I think it was memeing
 

3691
01:38:36,300 --> 01:38:37,370
I think it was memeing
so

3692
01:38:37,370 --> 01:38:37,380
so
 

3693
01:38:37,380 --> 01:38:39,590
so
that's like eight minutes or so just to

3694
01:38:39,590 --> 01:38:39,600
that's like eight minutes or so just to
 

3695
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:44,270
that's like eight minutes or so just to
take them off and on

3696
01:38:44,270 --> 01:38:44,280

 

3697
01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:46,310

yeah and then you have to check the

3698
01:38:46,310 --> 01:38:46,320
yeah and then you have to check the
 

3699
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:48,770
yeah and then you have to check the
calibration

3700
01:38:48,770 --> 01:38:48,780
calibration
 

3701
01:38:48,780 --> 01:38:51,709
calibration
it adds at least another minute if all

3702
01:38:51,709 --> 01:38:51,719
it adds at least another minute if all
 

3703
01:38:51,719 --> 01:38:53,450
it adds at least another minute if all
goes well

3704
01:38:53,450 --> 01:38:53,460
goes well
 

3705
01:38:53,460 --> 01:38:55,250
goes well
how many sense to annoying she's just

3706
01:38:55,250 --> 01:38:55,260
how many sense to annoying she's just
 

3707
01:38:55,260 --> 01:38:59,810
how many sense to annoying she's just
held in all day yeah yeah yeah she did

3708
01:38:59,810 --> 01:38:59,820

 

3709
01:38:59,820 --> 01:39:02,270

and then well the act of going to the

3710
01:39:02,270 --> 01:39:02,280
and then well the act of going to the
 

3711
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:04,129
and then well the act of going to the
idle meeting depends how long that takes

3712
01:39:04,129 --> 01:39:04,139
idle meeting depends how long that takes
 

3713
01:39:04,139 --> 01:39:06,830
idle meeting depends how long that takes
but so it's not really something you

3714
01:39:06,830 --> 01:39:06,840
but so it's not really something you
 

3715
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:11,330
but so it's not really something you
would uh do on stream

3716
01:39:11,330 --> 01:39:11,340

 

3717
01:39:11,340 --> 01:39:13,550

you would want to hold that back at all

3718
01:39:13,550 --> 01:39:13,560
you would want to hold that back at all
 

3719
01:39:13,560 --> 01:39:18,770
you would want to hold that back at all
cost

3720
01:39:18,770 --> 01:39:18,780

6189
02:47:01,200 --> 02:47:03,230
um
in hindsight I would have liked to add

6190
02:47:03,230 --> 02:47:03,240
in hindsight I would have liked to add
 

6191
02:47:03,240 --> 02:47:05,210
in hindsight I would have liked to add
even more chickens to the

even more chickens to the

6195
02:47:09,600 --> 02:47:10,969

but

6196
02:47:10,969 --> 02:47:10,979
but
 

6197
02:47:10,979 --> 02:47:12,830
but
I think it looked really good

6198
02:47:12,830 --> 02:47:12,840
I think it looked really good
 

6199
02:47:12,840 --> 02:47:15,590
I think it looked really good
yeah it's good that I could also go back

6200
02:47:15,590 --> 02:47:15,600
yeah it's good that I could also go back
 

6201
02:47:15,600 --> 02:47:17,330
yeah it's good that I could also go back
to the kitchen and all that

6202
02:47:17,330 --> 02:47:17,340
to the kitchen and all that
 

6203
02:47:17,340 --> 02:47:19,429
to the kitchen and all that
too bad that there that we can't go

6204
02:47:19,429 --> 02:47:19,439
too bad that there that we can't go
 

6205
02:47:19,439 --> 02:47:21,410
too bad that there that we can't go
inside the usual room but I think in

6206
02:47:21,410 --> 02:47:21,420
inside the usual room but I think in
 

6207
02:47:21,420 --> 02:47:23,630
inside the usual room but I think in
hindsight it's good that we couldn't go

6208
02:47:23,630 --> 02:47:23,640
hindsight it's good that we couldn't go
 

6209
02:47:23,640 --> 02:47:26,150
hindsight it's good that we couldn't go
in because

6210
02:47:26,150 --> 02:47:26,160
in because
 

6211
02:47:26,160 --> 02:47:28,730
in because
yeah they probably wouldn't have been

6212
02:47:28,730 --> 02:47:28,740
yeah they probably wouldn't have been
 

6213
02:47:28,740 --> 02:47:31,730
yeah they probably wouldn't have been
able to recreate the whole currently

6214
02:47:31,730 --> 02:47:31,740
able to recreate the whole currently
 

6215
02:47:31,740 --> 02:47:35,330
able to recreate the whole currently
Canon uh looks of the usual room that

6216
02:47:35,330 --> 02:47:35,340
Canon uh looks of the usual room that
 

6217
02:47:35,340 --> 02:47:37,849
Canon uh looks of the usual room that
would have been probably too much work

6218
02:47:37,849 --> 02:47:37,859
would have been probably too much work
 

6219
02:47:37,859 --> 02:47:40,790
would have been probably too much work
but um they would have probably turned

6220
02:47:40,790 --> 02:47:40,800
but um they would have probably turned
 

6221
02:47:40,800 --> 02:47:42,590
but um they would have probably turned
that down so I would have had to be

6222
02:47:42,590 --> 02:47:42,600
that down so I would have had to be
 

6223
02:47:42,600 --> 02:47:44,330
that down so I would have had to be
really simplified

6224
02:47:44,330 --> 02:47:44,340
really simplified
 

6225
02:47:44,340 --> 02:47:50,690
really simplified
maybe just simple back room for brooms

6226
02:47:50,690 --> 02:47:50,700

 

6227
02:47:50,700 --> 02:47:52,250

hmm

6228
02:47:52,250 --> 02:47:52,260
hmm
 

6229
02:47:52,260 --> 02:47:56,750
hmm
but I think yeah just the door with the

6230
02:47:56,750 --> 02:47:56,760
but I think yeah just the door with the
 

6231
02:47:56,760 --> 02:48:00,730
but I think yeah just the door with the
sign that says the usual room is already

6232
02:48:00,730 --> 02:48:00,740
sign that says the usual room is already
 

6233
02:48:00,740 --> 02:48:04,370
sign that says the usual room is already
threatening enough yeah the the picture

6234
02:48:04,370 --> 02:48:04,380
threatening enough yeah the the picture
 

6235
02:48:04,380 --> 02:48:08,210
threatening enough yeah the the picture
yeah

02:48:08,210 --> 02:48:08,220

 

6237
02:48:08,220 --> 02:48:10,969

it definitely is a door you do not want

6238
02:48:10,969 --> 02:48:10,979
it definitely is a door you do not want
 

6239
02:48:10,979 --> 02:48:17,780
it definitely is a door you do not want
to open

6240
02:48:17,780 --> 02:48:17,790
