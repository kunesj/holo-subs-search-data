I was recruiting for something, and I

3106
02:18:24,950 --> 02:18:24,960
I was recruiting for something, and I
 

3107
02:18:24,960 --> 02:18:28,389
I was recruiting for something, and I
heard about it on the internet.Well,

3108
02:18:28,389 --> 02:18:28,399
heard about it on the internet.Well,
 

3109
02:18:28,399 --> 02:18:31,370
heard about it on the internet.Well,
at that time, I didn't say it was Holotalk,

3110
02:18:31,370 --> 02:18:31,380
at that time, I didn't say it was Holotalk,
 

3111
02:18:31,380 --> 02:18:33,349
at that time, I didn't say it was Holotalk,
but I

3112
02:18:33,349 --> 02:18:33,359
but I
 

3113
02:18:33,359 --> 02:18:35,089
but I
received a lot of requests, and I was like, ``Holotalk.''  There were some

3114
02:18:35,089 --> 02:18:35,099
received a lot of requests, and I was like, ``Holotalk.''  There were some
 

3115
02:18:35,099 --> 02:18:37,549
received a lot of requests, and I was like, ``Holotalk.''  There were some
songs that I just couldn't sing,

3116
02:18:37,549 --> 02:18:37,559
songs that I just couldn't sing,
 

3117
02:18:37,559 --> 02:18:40,070
songs that I just couldn't sing,
and there were some rights issues that would be difficult to get right away,

3118
02:18:40,070 --> 02:18:40,080
and there were some rights issues that would be difficult to get right away,
 

3119
02:18:40,080 --> 02:18:41,870
