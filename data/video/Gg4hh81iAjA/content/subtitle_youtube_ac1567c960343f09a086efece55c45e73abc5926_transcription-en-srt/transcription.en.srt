here there's a scientist who can access

580
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:46,200
here there's a scientist who can access
 

581
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,230
here there's a scientist who can access
a portable vitals panel so they can

582
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:48,240
a portable vitals panel so they can
 

583
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,750
a portable vitals panel so they can
check at any point of time if there's

properly and well timed you'll be able
 

627
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,830
properly and well timed you'll be able
to prevent imposters from killing their

628
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:36,840
