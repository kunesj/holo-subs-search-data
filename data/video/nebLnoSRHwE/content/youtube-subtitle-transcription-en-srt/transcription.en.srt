00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:08,750
we couldn't I didn't have you know like
a little little pin to open up the hole

1336
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:08,760
a little little pin to open up the hole
 

1337
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,250
a little little pin to open up the hole
on the back of the phone to put the SIM

1338
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:10,260
on the back of the phone to put the SIM
 

1339
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:13,849
on the back of the phone to put the SIM
card in so I was like uh we first need

1340
00:37:13,849 --> 00:37:13,859
card in so I was like uh we first need
 

1341
00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:16,190
card in so I was like uh we first need
something maybe in the hotel or so but

1342
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:16,200
something maybe in the hotel or so but
 

1343
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,589
something maybe in the hotel or so but
until then like at the airport we could

1344
00:37:18,589 --> 00:37:18,599
until then like at the airport we could
 

1345
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:20,630
until then like at the airport we could
use the airport Wi-Fi to find a route to

1346
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:20,640
use the airport Wi-Fi to find a route to
 

1347
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,849
use the airport Wi-Fi to find a route to
get to the hotel

1348
00:37:22,849 --> 00:37:22,859
get to the hotel
 

1349
00:37:22,859 --> 00:37:25,370
get to the hotel
um so we just saved the route and then

1350
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:25,380
um so we just saved the route and then
 

1351
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,589
um so we just saved the route and then
hoped that we would arrive eventually

1352
00:37:27,589 --> 00:37:27,599
hoped that we would arrive eventually
 

1353
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,670
hoped that we would arrive eventually
but uh turns out the train had internet

1354
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:31,680
but uh turns out the train had internet
 

1355
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,670
but uh turns out the train had internet
too and I in hindsight I noticed so many

1356
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:34,680

00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:38,480
places that had Wi-Fi in London
 

1359

01:25:01,380 --> 01:25:02,930
um but it was important information for
us because we needed to get back to

3500
01:25:02,930 --> 01:25:02,940
us because we needed to get back to
 

3501
01:25:02,940 --> 01:25:04,910
us because we needed to get back to
London and this is so far away it took

3502
01:25:04,910 --> 01:25:04,920
London and this is so far away it took
 

3503
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:06,229
London and this is so far away it took
us two and a half hours to get here

3504
01:25:06,229 --> 01:25:06,239
us two and a half hours to get here
 

3505
01:25:06,239 --> 01:25:08,090
us two and a half hours to get here
during the day now with the night time

3506
01:25:08,090 --> 01:25:08,100
during the day now with the night time
 

3507
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:09,530
during the day now with the night time
of course there's not gonna be that many

3508
01:25:09,530 --> 01:25:09,540
of course there's not gonna be that many
 

3509
01:25:09,540 --> 01:25:12,050
of course there's not gonna be that many
connections either right

3510
01:25:12,050 --> 01:25:12,060
connections either right
 

3511
01:25:12,060 --> 01:25:17,390
connections either right
um so I expected it to be at most two

3512
01:25:17,390 --> 01:25:17,400
um so I expected it to be at most two
 

3513
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:19,610
um so I expected it to be at most two
hours and if it was that it would have

3514
01:25:19,610 --> 01:25:19,620
hours and if it was that it would have
 

3515
01:25:19,620 --> 01:25:22,270
hours and if it was that it would have
been fine

3516
01:25:22,270 --> 01:25:22,280

 

3517
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:24,350

us the thing is like the bus that we

3562
01:26:10,910 --> 01:26:10,920
us the thing is like the bus that we
 

3563
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:13,669
us the thing is like the bus that we
took which covered quite a distance uh

3564
01:26:13,669 --> 01:26:13,679
took which covered quite a distance uh
 

3565
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:16,430

the thing is the problem is it's far

6018
02:19:27,469 --> 02:19:27,479
the thing is the problem is it's far
 

6019
02:19:27,479 --> 02:19:30,650
the thing is the problem is it's far
away from everywhere so if you're in the

6020
02:19:30,650 --> 02:19:30,660
away from everywhere so if you're in the
 

6021
02:19:30,660 --> 02:19:33,589
away from everywhere so if you're in the
UK I say it's worth it go there

6022
02:19:33,589 --> 02:19:33,599
UK I say it's worth it go there
 

6023
02:19:33,599 --> 02:19:36,290
UK I say it's worth it go there
if you're not in the UK

6024
02:19:36,290 --> 02:19:36,300
if you're not in the UK
 

6025
02:19:36,300 --> 02:19:40,610
if you're not in the UK
is it worth it going there for this in

6026
02:19:40,610 --> 02:19:40,620
is it worth it going there for this in
 

6027
02:19:40,620 --> 02:19:43,129
is it worth it going there for this in
particular I say if you live in Europe

6028
02:19:43,129 --> 02:19:43,139
particular I say if you live in Europe
 

6029
02:19:43,139 --> 02:19:45,469
particular I say if you live in Europe
then it's easy to get there relatively

6030
02:19:45,469 --> 02:19:45,479
then it's easy to get there relatively
 

6031
02:19:45,479 --> 02:19:47,089
then it's easy to get there relatively
easy relatively fast

6032
02:19:47,089 --> 02:19:47,099
easy relatively fast
 

6033
02:19:47,099 --> 02:19:51,290
easy relatively fast
so as a European yes if you combine it

6034
02:19:51,290 --> 02:19:51,300
so as a European yes if you combine it

things then it will be worth it if
 

6043
02:20:01,260 --> 02:20:02,840
