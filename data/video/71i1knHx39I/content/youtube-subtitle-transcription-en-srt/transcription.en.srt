339
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,749

so then she gave me the real coordinates

340
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:03,759
so then she gave me the real coordinates
 

341
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,029
so then she gave me the real coordinates
and then i was following the real

342
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:05,039
and then i was following the real
 

343
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,270
and then i was following the real
coordinates but they were so far away

00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,070
the problem here is that there's a lot
of gas always attacking so there's

844
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:56,080
of gas always attacking so there's
 

845
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,669
of gas always attacking so there's
always a lot of fire

846
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:57,679
always a lot of fire
 

847
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,909
always a lot of fire
um that is true it's always it might

848
00:18:59,909 --> 00:18:59,919
um that is true it's always it might
 

849
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,110
um that is true it's always it might
destroy the building

850
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:01,120
destroy the building
 

851
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,750
destroy the building
so we'll have to like guest proof it yes

852
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:03,760
so we'll have to like guest proof it yes
 

853
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,470
so we'll have to like guest proof it yes

01:47:02,310 --> 01:47:02,320
i think yeah oh you can craft it with
 

4327
01:47:02,320 --> 01:47:03,030
i think yeah oh you can craft it with
gold

4328
01:47:03,030 --> 01:47:03,040
gold
 

4329
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:06,550
gold
what oh i thought oh

4330
01:47:06,550 --> 01:47:06,560
what oh i thought oh
 

4331
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:11,590
what oh i thought oh
that makes sense belle

4332
01:47:11,590 --> 01:47:11,600

 

4333
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:14,149

what's it called what's it called no you

4334
01:47:14,149 --> 01:47:14,159
what's it called what's it called no you
 

4335
01:47:14,159 --> 01:47:14,950
what's it called what's it called no you
can't okay

4336
01:47:14,950 --> 01:47:14,960
can't okay
 

4337
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:17,830

no you can't you can't so i guess it's

4338
01:47:17,830 --> 01:47:17,840
no you can't you can't so i guess it's
 

4339
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:19,669
no you can't you can't so i guess it's
just it's an item that you have to get

4340
01:47:19,669 --> 01:47:19,679
just it's an item that you have to get
 

4341
