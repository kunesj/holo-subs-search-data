okay uh then

2668
01:13:02,870 --> 01:13:02,880

 

2669
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:07,430

finally here we go maybe outside or

2670
01:13:07,430 --> 01:13:07,440
finally here we go maybe outside or
 

2671
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:10,229
finally here we go maybe outside or
inside is it probably difficult for them

2672
01:13:10,229 --> 01:13:10,239
inside is it probably difficult for them
 

2673
01:13:10,239 --> 01:13:12,910
inside is it probably difficult for them
to get inside

2674
01:13:12,910 --> 01:13:12,920
to get inside
 

2675
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:17,229
to get inside
so probably is it one

2676
01:13:17,229 --> 01:13:17,239

 

2677
01:13:17,239 --> 01:13:19,750

14371
06:24:37,360 --> 06:24:39,468
in when I didn't sing for a moment then
I sing and she immediately leaves the

14372
06:24:39,468 --> 06:24:39,478
I sing and she immediately leaves the
 

14373
06:24:39,478 --> 06:24:41,948
I sing and she immediately leaves the

the room
immediately well that's probably also

14382
06:24:51,270 --> 06:24:51,280
immediately well that's probably also
 

14383
06:24:51,280 --> 06:24:54,270
immediately well that's probably also
because when I sing I'm kind of

14384
06:24:54,270 --> 06:24:54,280
because when I sing I'm kind of
 

14385
06:24:54,280 --> 06:24:58,030
because when I sing I'm kind of
loud and she doesn't like the

14387
06:24:58,040 --> 06:25:01,030
loud and she doesn't like the
noise but yeah that just tells you they

14388
06:25:01,030 --> 06:25:01,040
noise but yeah that just tells you they
 

14389
06:25:01,040 --> 06:25:05,190
noise but yeah that just tells you they
normally when I'm loud here they go

14390
06:25:05,190 --> 06:25:05,200
normally when I'm loud here they go
 

14391
