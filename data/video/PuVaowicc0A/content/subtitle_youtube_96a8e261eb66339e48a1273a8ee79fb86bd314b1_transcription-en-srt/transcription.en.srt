off stream like um if i'm doing a collab
 

925
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,750
off stream like um if i'm doing a collab
of practice

926
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:27,760
of practice
 

927
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,950
of practice
like i might have um playing among us

928
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:30,960
like i might have um playing among us
 

929
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,110
like i might have um playing among us
with people on discord to practice

930

with people on discord to practice
 

931
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,230
with people on discord to practice
before i collab

932
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:34,240
before i collab
 

933
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,149
before i collab
so i'll probably put the lobby code out

934
00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:36,159
so i'll probably put the lobby code out
 

935
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,070
so i'll probably put the lobby code out
to members first if it's not full i'll

936
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:38,080
to members first if it's not full i'll
 

937
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,190
to members first if it's not full i'll
put it in the other one as well of

938
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:39,200
put it in the other one as well of
 

939
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:39,830
put it in the other one as well of
course

940
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:39,840
course
 

941
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,110
course
but if it's going to be full i'm going

942
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:41,120
but if it's going to be full i'm going
 

943
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,789
but if it's going to be full i'm going
to give members priority i think for

944
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:42,799
to give members priority i think for
 

945
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,549
to give members priority i think for
some of the off-stream stuff

946
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:44,559
some of the off-stream stuff
 

947
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,029
some of the off-stream stuff
but that isn't to say i won't ever do

948
00:23:47,029 --> 00:23:47,039
but that isn't to say i won't ever do
 

949
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,310
but that isn't to say i won't ever do
some that'll be in the main discord i'll

950
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:48,320
some that'll be in the main discord i'll
 

951
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,350
some that'll be in the main discord i'll
probably do that as well

952
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:49,360
probably do that as well
 

953
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,789
probably do that as well
especially because i want to test among

954
00:23:50,789 --> 00:23:50,799
especially because i want to test among
 

955

and um pamphlet e plus that one's going
 

963
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,870
and um pamphlet e plus that one's going
to be us999 a month

964
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:00,880
to be us999 a month
 

965
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,350
to be us999 a month
but that's going to come with pam packs

966
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:03,360
but that's going to come with pam packs
 

967
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,110
