um because we expected that they will
 

3111
02:07:02,219 --> 02:07:04,729
um because we expected that they will
not use the middle one we we actually

3112
02:07:04,729 --> 02:07:04,739
not use the middle one we we actually
 

3113

02:07:12,169 --> 02:07:12,179
um we didn't think that they will choose
 

3117
02:07:12,179 --> 02:07:14,330
um we didn't think that they will choose
that shred we think that we're gonna

3118
02:07:14,330 --> 02:07:14,340
that shred we think that we're gonna
 

3119
02:07:14,340 --> 02:07:17,930
that shred we think that we're gonna
fight under uh the basement

3120
02:07:17,930 --> 02:07:17,940
fight under uh the basement
 

3121

3135
02:07:35,340 --> 02:07:40,609
haven't um explained this threat before
but um what we have in mind uh we go

3136
02:07:40,609 --> 02:07:40,619
but um what we have in mind uh we go
 

3137
02:07:40,619 --> 02:07:45,890
but um what we have in mind uh we go
so we um I even I even um stopwatch you

3138
02:07:45,890 --> 02:07:45,900
so we um I even I even um stopwatch you
 

3139
02:07:45,900 --> 02:07:48,350
so we um I even I even um stopwatch you
know the the right side and the left

3140
02:07:48,350 --> 02:07:48,360
know the the right side and the left
 

3141
02:07:48,360 --> 02:07:51,350
know the the right side and the left
side last night I stopped watch it and

3142
02:07:51,350 --> 02:07:51,360
side last night I stopped watch it and
 

3143
02:07:51,360 --> 02:07:52,129
side last night I stopped watch it and
then

3144
02:07:52,129 --> 02:07:52,139
then
 

3145
02:07:52,139 --> 02:07:56,089
then
um we know that the the fastest way is

3146
02:07:56,089 --> 02:07:56,099
um we know that the the fastest way is
 

3147
02:07:56,099 --> 02:07:58,550
um we know that the the fastest way is
actually the right one so we asked like

3148
02:07:58,550 --> 02:07:58,560
actually the right one so we asked like
 

3149
02:07:58,560 --> 02:08:00,950
actually the right one so we asked like
three people to go uh to the right

3150
02:08:00,950 --> 02:08:00,960
three people to go uh to the right
 

3151
02:08:00,960 --> 02:08:04,010
three people to go uh to the right

at this
the I even tested the area so I asked

3168
02:08:27,350 --> 02:08:27,360
the I even tested the area so I asked
 

3169

but yeah why we are not taking the
 

3197
02:09:04,980 --> 02:09:07,430
but yeah why we are not taking the
middle straight just because we think

3198
02:09:07,430 --> 02:09:07,440
middle straight just because we think
 

3199
02:09:07,440 --> 02:09:10,070
middle straight just because we think
that they will not take that path so

3200
02:09:10,070 --> 02:09:10,080
that they will not take that path so
 

3201
02:09:10,080 --> 02:09:11,689
that they will not take that path so
yeah if you think that we are not

3202
02:09:11,689 --> 02:09:11,699
yeah if you think that we are not
 

3203
02:09:11,699 --> 02:09:15,649
yeah if you think that we are not
defending we do defending the reason why

3204
02:09:15,649 --> 02:09:15,659
