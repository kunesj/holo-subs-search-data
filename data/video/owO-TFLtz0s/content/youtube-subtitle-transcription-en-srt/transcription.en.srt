coating but if you look closely you will

1712
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:53,940
coating but if you look closely you will
 

1713
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:56,750
coating but if you look closely you will
see that some of them are darker color

1714
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:56,760
see that some of them are darker color
 

1715
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,030
see that some of them are darker color
than others yes

so the darker ones are dark chocolate

1718
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:01,020
so the darker ones are dark chocolate
 

1719
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,810
so the darker ones are dark chocolate
and the lighter ones are milk chocolate

1720
