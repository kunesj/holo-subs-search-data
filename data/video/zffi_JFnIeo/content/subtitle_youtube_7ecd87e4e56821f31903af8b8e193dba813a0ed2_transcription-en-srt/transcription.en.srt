in here that's can we pick it up water I
 

599
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:05,030
in here that's can we pick it up water I
think the one thing I remember is that

600

it's really important for us to find
 

603
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:09,189
it's really important for us to find
water and not to like save it like save

604
00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:09,199
water and not to like save it like save
 

605
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,030
water and not to like save it like save
it and not drink it and figure out how

606
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,040
it and not drink it and figure out how
 

607
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,189
it and not drink it and figure out how
to craft like water reservoirs and

608
00:15:14,189 --> 00:15:14,199
to craft like water reservoirs and
 

609
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:17,350
to craft like water reservoirs and
water water yeah mky water will give you

it was really weird because it worked
 

3609
01:28:57,520 --> 01:28:58,750
it was really weird because it worked
the other day when we tested it didn't

3610
01:28:58,750 --> 01:28:58,760
the other day when we tested it didn't
 

3611
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:00,910
the other day when we tested it didn't

strange
 

3615
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:04,470
strange
so maybe it's based on if there's like

3616
01:29:04,470 --> 01:29:04,480
so maybe it's based on if there's like
 

3617
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:07,750
so maybe it's based on if there's like
less people so smaller amounts of people

3618
01:29:07,750 --> 01:29:07,760
less people so smaller amounts of people
 

3619

we can craft a dual collector that's yes
we definitely need to craft one of those

6086
02:25:43,630 --> 02:25:43,640
we definitely need to craft one of those
 

6087
02:25:43,640 --> 02:25:47,110
we definitely need to craft one of those
so yeah if we do that that would be nice

6088
02:25:47,110 --> 02:25:47,120
so yeah if we do that that would be nice
 

6089
02:25:47,120 --> 02:25:48,349
so yeah if we do that that would be nice
yeah it's we need something called a

yeah it's we need something called a
 

6091
02:25:48,359 --> 02:25:51,150
yeah it's we need something called a
polymer something or another

6092
02:25:51,150 --> 02:25:51,160
polymer something or another
 

6093
02:25:51,160 --> 02:25:53,910

workstation I we have we have po oh yeah

6094
02:25:53,910 --> 02:25:53,920
workstation I we have we have po oh yeah
 

6095
02:25:53,920 --> 02:25:56,110
workstation I we have we have po oh yeah
workstation uh so a certain skill will

6096
02:25:56,110 --> 02:25:56,120
workstation uh so a certain skill will
 

6097
02:25:56,120 --> 02:25:57,510
workstation uh so a certain skill will
unlock being able to make the

6098
02:25:57,510 --> 02:25:57,520
unlock being able to make the
 

6099
02:25:57,520 --> 02:26:00,349
unlock being able to make the
workstation it's a robotics where is it

6100
02:26:00,349 --> 02:26:00,359
workstation it's a robotics where is it
 

6101
02:26:00,359 --> 02:26:03,590
workstation it's a robotics where is it
oh we need like aund scrap Advanced

6102
02:26:03,590 --> 02:26:03,600
oh we need like aund scrap Advanced
 

6103
02:26:03,600 --> 02:26:06,150
oh we need like aund scrap Advanced
engineering yeah I see well let's get to
