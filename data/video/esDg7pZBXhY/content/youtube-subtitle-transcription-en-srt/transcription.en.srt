you know actually tilting the motion the

1308
00:36:05,829 --> 00:36:05,839
you know actually tilting the motion the
 

1309
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:08,829
you know actually tilting the motion the
controls it adds flavor but like

1310

difficult you know okay like when I
 

1315
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,630
difficult you know okay like when I
played uh because there's no motion

1316

05:51:51,910 --> 05:51:51,920
spend on the motion capture suit to be
 

13044
05:51:51,920 --> 05:51:55,628
spend on the motion capture suit to be
honest with you H oh but speaking of

13045
05:51:55,628 --> 05:51:55,638
honest with you H oh but speaking of
 

13046
05:51:55,638 --> 05:52:00,350
honest with you H oh but speaking of
that um think of the fact that my next

13047
05:52:00,350 --> 05:52:00,360
that um think of the fact that my next
 

13048
05:52:00,360 --> 05:52:03,590
that um think of the fact that my next
single is already finished and it will

13049
05:52:03,590 --> 05:52:03,600
single is already finished and it will
 

13050
05:52:03,600 --> 05:52:08,948
single is already finished and it will
have to have a 3D music video whether I

13051
05:52:08,948 --> 05:52:08,958
have to have a 3D music video whether I
 

13052
05:52:08,958 --> 05:52:11,230
have to have a 3D music video whether I
get into your vision or

13053
05:52:11,230 --> 05:52:11,240
get into your vision or
 

13054
05:52:11,240 --> 05:52:14,070
get into your vision or
not

13055
05:52:14,070 --> 05:52:14,080
not
 

13056
05:52:14,080 --> 05:52:17,070
not
um and that would be pretty close to

13057
05:52:17,070 --> 05:52:17,080
um and that would be pretty close to
 

13058
05:52:17,080 --> 05:52:19,430
um and that would be pretty close to
sleeptalking and the suit still not

13059
05:52:19,430 --> 05:52:19,440
sleeptalking and the suit still not
 

13060
05:52:19,440 --> 05:52:22,030
sleeptalking and the suit still not
being there and me running out of time

13061
05:52:22,030 --> 05:52:22,040
being there and me running out of time
 

13062
05:52:22,040 --> 05:52:26,310
being there and me running out of time
and all that I think I might just try to

13063
05:52:26,310 --> 05:52:26,320
and all that I think I might just try to
 

13064
05:52:26,320 --> 05:52:31,510
and all that I think I might just try to
quickly prepare um a 2d music video not

13065
05:52:31,510 --> 05:52:31,520
quickly prepare um a 2d music video not
 

13066
05:52:31,520 --> 05:52:33,230
quickly prepare um a 2d music video not
not this like I want a few more

13067
05:52:33,230 --> 05:52:33,240
not this like I want a few more
 

13068
05:52:33,240 --> 05:52:35,628
not this like I want a few more

13069
05:52:35,628 --> 05:52:35,638
illustrations though not just one I'll
 

13070
05:52:35,638 --> 05:52:38,270
illustrations though not just one I'll
see what I can do I might just settle

13071
05:52:38,270 --> 05:52:38,280
see what I can do I might just settle
 

13072
05:52:38,280 --> 05:52:42,948
see what I can do I might just settle
for 2D now and and then put all my power

13073
05:52:42,948 --> 05:52:42,958
for 2D now and and then put all my power
 

13074
05:52:42,958 --> 05:52:46,190
for 2D now and and then put all my power
into the next 3D music

13075
05:52:46,190 --> 05:52:46,200
into the next 3D music
 

13076
05:52:46,200 --> 05:52:48,590
into the next 3D music
video what's happening with the suit

document and so I was like wait why

13161
05:54:43,230 --> 05:54:43,240
document and so I was like wait why
 

13162
05:54:43,240 --> 05:54:45,230

the point of asking you to handle

13169
05:54:51,708 --> 05:54:51,718
the point of asking you to handle
 

13170
05:54:51,718 --> 05:54:54,948
the point of asking you to handle
it so that's why currently it looks like

13171
05:54:54,948 --> 05:54:54,958
it so that's why currently it looks like
 

13172
05:54:54,958 --> 05:54:56,788
it so that's why currently it looks like
even though we have everything ready the

13173
05:54:56,788 --> 05:54:56,798
even though we have everything ready the
 

13174
05:54:56,798 --> 05:54:59,270
even though we have everything ready the
only thing is missing is the V number so

13175
05:54:59,270 --> 05:54:59,280
only thing is missing is the V number so
 

13176
05:54:59,280 --> 05:55:02,468
only thing is missing is the V number so
it's like what the yeah it's an

13177
05:55:02,468 --> 05:55:02,478
it's like what the yeah it's an
 

13178
05:55:02,478 --> 05:55:04,350
it's like what the yeah it's an
it's not a tax number it's an individual

13179
05:55:04,350 --> 05:55:04,360
it's not a tax number it's an individual
 

13180
05:55:04,360 --> 05:55:05,788
it's not a tax number it's an individual
number that you have to apply for that

13181
05:55:05,788 --> 05:55:05,798
number that you have to apply for that
 

13182
05:55:05,798 --> 05:55:07,990
number that you have to apply for that
normally you only really have if you

13183
05:55:07,990 --> 05:55:08,000
normally you only really have if you
 

13184
05:55:08,000 --> 05:55:10,788
normally you only really have if you
have like a business in

13185
05:55:10,788 --> 05:55:10,798
have like a business in
 

13186
05:55:10,798 --> 05:55:12,910
have like a business in
Europe I

13187
05:55:12,910 --> 05:55:12,920
Europe I
 

13188
05:55:12,920 --> 05:55:15,310
Europe I
think so you see there like so much time

13189
05:55:15,310 --> 05:55:15,320
think so you see there like so much time
 

13190
05:55:15,320 --> 05:55:16,910
think so you see there like so much time
being wasted and it's not looking good

13191
05:55:16,910 --> 05:55:16,920
being wasted and it's not looking good
 

13192
05:55:16,920 --> 05:55:18,430
being wasted and it's not looking good
anymore I'm not optimistic anymore that

13193
05:55:18,430 --> 05:55:18,440
anymore I'm not optimistic anymore that
 

13194
05:55:18,440 --> 05:55:19,670
anymore I'm not optimistic anymore that
I'm getting it but when I should be

13195
05:55:19,670 --> 05:55:19,680
I'm getting it but when I should be
 

13196
