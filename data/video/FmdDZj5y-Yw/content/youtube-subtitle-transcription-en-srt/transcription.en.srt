00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:14,790
all the dlcs out all of the waves
they come out by then yeah they say by

1404
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:14,800
they come out by then yeah they say by
 

1405
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,069
they come out by then yeah they say by
the end of the year that's the promise

1406
00:39:16,069 --> 00:39:16,079
the end of the year that's the promise
 

1407
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,550

from nintendo and you know nintendo

1408
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:18,560
from nintendo and you know nintendo
 

1409
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:25,270
from nintendo and you know nintendo
keeps their promises right

1410
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:25,280

 

1411
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,069

so

1412
00:39:26,069 --> 00:39:26,079
so
 

1413
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:28,630
so
maybe dlc only tournament

1414
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:28,640
maybe dlc only tournament
 

1415
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,390
maybe dlc only tournament
oh that would be fun

1416
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:30,400
oh that would be fun
 

1417
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,630
oh that would be fun
yeah because then we don't i mean we've

1418
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:32,640
yeah because then we don't i mean we've
 

1419
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,710
yeah because then we don't i mean we've
all seen the

1420
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:34,720
all seen the
 

1421
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:39,109
all seen the
already existing tracks a million times

1422
00:39:39,109 --> 00:39:39,119
already existing tracks a million times
 

1423
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:44,069
