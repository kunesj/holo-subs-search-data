5250
02:15:02,169 --> 02:15:02,179
edges first oh
 

5251
02:15:02,179 --> 02:15:04,390
edges first oh
ah

5252
02:15:04,390 --> 02:15:04,400
ah
 

5253
02:15:04,400 --> 02:15:07,550
ah
interesting go to the one that says

5254
02:15:07,550 --> 02:15:07,560
interesting go to the one that says
 

5255
02:15:07,560 --> 02:15:11,149
interesting go to the one that says
don't give up that's why the arrow was

5256
02:15:11,149 --> 02:15:11,159
don't give up that's why the arrow was
 

5257
02:15:11,159 --> 02:15:12,530
don't give up that's why the arrow was
showing there

showing there
 

5259
02:15:12,540 --> 02:15:14,330
showing there
because that one connected to that and

5260
02:15:14,330 --> 02:15:14,340
because that one connected to that and
 

5261
02:15:14,340 --> 02:15:23,149
because that one connected to that and
it connects today

5307
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:53,570

that doesn't fit does it

5308
02:16:53,570 --> 02:16:53,580
that doesn't fit does it
 

5309
02:16:53,580 --> 02:16:55,910
that doesn't fit does it
it's not a perfect fit

5310
02:16:55,910 --> 02:16:55,920
it's not a perfect fit
 

5311
02:16:55,920 --> 02:16:58,610
it's not a perfect fit
that is that that looks maybe like a

as long as it lets me connected I guess

5316
02:17:03,169 --> 02:17:03,179
as long as it lets me connected I guess
 

5317
02:17:03,179 --> 02:17:05,290

her POV and she told me she wasn't going

6914
02:57:19,010 --> 02:57:19,020
her POV and she told me she wasn't going
 

6915
02:57:19,020 --> 02:57:20,450
her POV and she told me she wasn't going
to stream but she ended up streaming it

6916
02:57:20,450 --> 02:57:20,460
to stream but she ended up streaming it
 

6917
02:57:20,460 --> 02:57:21,710
to stream but she ended up streaming it
so

6918
02:57:21,710 --> 02:57:21,720

I think for amargus very important

6922
02:57:27,889 --> 02:57:27,899
I think for amargus very important
 

6923
02:57:27,899 --> 02:57:31,670
I think for amargus very important
to have as many povs as possible and I

6924
02:57:31,670 --> 02:57:31,680
to have as many povs as possible and I
 

6925
02:57:31,680 --> 02:57:34,550
to have as many povs as possible and I

liked her her POV teammates were crying
 

6927
02:57:34,560 --> 02:57:36,889
liked her her POV teammates were crying
about is that why she ended up streaming

better crawling you to this setting and
 

6959
02:58:16,800 --> 02:58:18,110
better crawling you to this setting and
this setting on and this often this

6960
02:58:18,110 --> 02:58:18,120
this setting on and this often this
 

6961
02:58:18,120 --> 02:58:19,670
this setting on and this often this
Anonymous often is under this off and

6962
02:58:19,670 --> 02:58:19,680
Anonymous often is under this off and
 

6963
02:58:19,680 --> 02:58:21,650
Anonymous often is under this off and
then for Among Us need to make sure to

6964
02:58:21,650 --> 02:58:21,660
then for Among Us need to make sure to
 

6965
02:58:21,660 --> 02:58:23,809
then for Among Us need to make sure to
have the Cosmic Cube not only redeem but

6966
02:58:23,809 --> 02:58:23,819
have the Cosmic Cube not only redeem but
 

6967
02:58:23,819 --> 02:58:26,349
have the Cosmic Cube not only redeem but
also activated have you done that yet

6968
02:58:26,349 --> 02:58:26,359
also activated have you done that yet
 

6969
02:58:26,359 --> 02:58:30,050
also activated have you done that yet
and so many times I had to explain also

6970
02:58:30,050 --> 02:58:30,060
and so many times I had to explain also
 

6971
02:58:30,060 --> 02:58:32,030
and so many times I had to explain also
the thing with the Cosmic Cube because I

6972
02:58:32,030 --> 02:58:32,040
the thing with the Cosmic Cube because I
 

6973
02:58:32,040 --> 02:58:33,889
the thing with the Cosmic Cube because I
asked the girls have you guys activated

6974
02:58:33,889 --> 02:58:33,899
asked the girls have you guys activated
 

6975
02:58:33,899 --> 02:58:35,450
asked the girls have you guys activated
it in the game as well and everybody

6976
02:58:35,450 --> 02:58:35,460
it in the game as well and everybody
 

6977
02:58:35,460 --> 02:58:37,849
it in the game as well and everybody
said yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but

6978
02:58:37,849 --> 02:58:37,859
said yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but
 

6979
02:58:37,859 --> 02:58:39,530
said yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but
then turns out when I dig a little bit

6980
02:58:39,530 --> 02:58:39,540
then turns out when I dig a little bit
 

6981
02:58:39,540 --> 02:58:42,550
then turns out when I dig a little bit
deeper because I knew I knew that

6982
02:58:42,550 --> 02:58:42,560
deeper because I knew I knew that
 

6983
02:58:42,560 --> 02:58:45,290
deeper because I knew I knew that
surely some of them did not realize that

6984
02:58:45,290 --> 02:58:45,300
surely some of them did not realize that
 

6985
02:58:45,300 --> 02:58:47,510
surely some of them did not realize that
you also have to activate it in game

6986
02:58:47,510 --> 02:58:47,520
you also have to activate it in game
 

6987
02:58:47,520 --> 02:58:49,730
you also have to activate it in game
when I say activate in-game I mean

6988
02:58:49,730 --> 02:58:49,740
when I say activate in-game I mean
 

6989
02:58:49,740 --> 02:58:52,610
when I say activate in-game I mean
activate in game not redeem the code

6990
02:58:52,610 --> 02:58:52,620
activate in game not redeem the code
 

6991
02:58:52,620 --> 02:58:55,610
activate in game not redeem the code
so then I found out some of them really

6992
02:58:55,610 --> 02:58:55,620
so then I found out some of them really
 

6993
02:58:55,620 --> 02:58:57,590
so then I found out some of them really
didn't activate it and they were like oh

6994
02:58:57,590 --> 02:58:57,600
didn't activate it and they were like oh
 

6995
02:58:57,600 --> 02:58:59,690
didn't activate it and they were like oh
what do you mean and I'm like ah you

6996
02:58:59,690 --> 02:58:59,700
what do you mean and I'm like ah you
 

6997
02:58:59,700 --> 02:59:01,790
what do you mean and I'm like ah you
have to go in here after Redeeming the

6998
02:59:01,790 --> 02:59:01,800
have to go in here after Redeeming the
 

6999
02:59:01,800 --> 02:59:03,650
have to go in here after Redeeming the
code you have to click here activate

7000
02:59:03,650 --> 02:59:03,660
code you have to click here activate
 

7001
02:59:03,660 --> 02:59:05,330
code you have to click here activate
otherwise you will not be able to gain

7002
02:59:05,330 --> 02:59:05,340
otherwise you will not be able to gain
 

7003
02:59:05,340 --> 02:59:07,370
otherwise you will not be able to gain
the points

7004
02:59:07,370 --> 02:59:07,380
the points
 

7005
02:59:07,380 --> 02:59:10,250
the points
yeah yeah I did my research and I tried

7006
02:59:10,250 --> 02:59:10,260
yeah yeah I did my research and I tried
 

7007
02:59:10,260 --> 02:59:11,929
yeah yeah I did my research and I tried
to share my knowledge

7008
02:59:11,929 --> 02:59:11,939
to share my knowledge
 

7009
02:59:11,939 --> 02:59:14,389
to share my knowledge
but with 11 members it was really

7010
02:59:14,389 --> 02:59:14,399
but with 11 members it was really
 

7011
02:59:14,399 --> 02:59:16,870
but with 11 members it was really
difficult

7012
02:59:16,870 --> 02:59:16,880
difficult
 

7013
02:59:16,880 --> 02:59:18,710
difficult
yeah

7014
02:59:18,710 --> 02:59:18,720
yeah
 

7015
02:59:18,720 --> 02:59:22,090

7017
02:59:22,100 --> 02:59:25,790
