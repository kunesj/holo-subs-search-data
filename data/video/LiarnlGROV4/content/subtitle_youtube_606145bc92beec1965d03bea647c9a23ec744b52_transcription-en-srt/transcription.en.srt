with uh Korean reading I think

2300
01:19:04,229 --> 01:19:04,239
with uh Korean reading I think
 

2301
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:07,669
with uh Korean reading I think
because in romanized letters they

2302
01:19:07,669 --> 01:19:07,679
because in romanized letters they
 

2303
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:10,229
because in romanized letters they
translate it as GA a but the real

2304
01:19:10,229 --> 01:19:10,239
translate it as GA a but the real
 

2305
01:19:10,239 --> 01:19:13,229
translate it as GA a but the real
pronunciation is more like Ka but it's

2306
01:19:13,229 --> 01:19:13,239
pronunciation is more like Ka but it's
 

2307
01:19:13,239 --> 01:19:15,709
pronunciation is more like Ka but it's
also kind of like an in between right

2308
01:19:15,709 --> 01:19:15,719
also kind of like an in between right
 

2309
01:19:15,719 --> 01:19:19,790
also kind of like an in between right
but in Japanese there's GA and Ka so I

2310
01:19:19,790 --> 01:19:19,800
but in Japanese there's GA and Ka so I
 

2311
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:23,149
but in Japanese there's GA and Ka so I
take it very seriously if it says GA

2312
