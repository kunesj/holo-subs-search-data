up with much more interesting things to

16258
07:19:05,690 --> 07:19:05,700
up with much more interesting things to
 

16259
07:19:05,700 --> 07:19:07,788
up with much more interesting things to
talk about and banter about and it's

16260
07:19:07,788 --> 07:19:07,798
talk about and banter about and it's
 

16261
07:19:07,798 --> 07:19:10,910

um
 

16265
07:19:11,638 --> 07:19:13,490
um
so I think it's going in the right

16266
07:19:13,490 --> 07:19:13,500
so I think it's going in the right
 

16267
07:19:13,500 --> 07:19:16,850
so I think it's going in the right
direction by having

16268
07:19:16,850 --> 07:19:16,860
direction by having
 

16269
07:19:16,860 --> 07:19:20,868
direction by having
um it be more about something else maybe

16270
07:19:20,868 --> 07:19:20,878
um it be more about something else maybe
 

16271
07:19:20,878 --> 07:19:21,910
um it be more about something else maybe
they

16272
07:19:21,910 --> 07:19:21,920
they
 

16273
07:19:21,920 --> 07:19:24,830
they
tried a bit too hard to like put a mini

16274
07:19:24,830 --> 07:19:24,840
tried a bit too hard to like put a mini
 

16275
07:19:24,840 --> 07:19:28,250
tried a bit too hard to like put a mini
game into every single MC

16276
07:19:28,250 --> 07:19:28,260
game into every single MC
 

16277
07:19:28,260 --> 07:19:30,350
game into every single MC
maybe that wasn't necessary but I think

16278
07:19:30,350 --> 07:19:30,360
maybe that wasn't necessary but I think
 

16279
07:19:30,360 --> 07:19:31,548
maybe that wasn't necessary but I think
it's more interesting than just talking

16280
07:19:31,548 --> 07:19:31,558
it's more interesting than just talking
 

16281
07:19:31,558 --> 07:19:33,230
it's more interesting than just talking
about

16282
07:19:33,230 --> 07:19:33,240
about
 

16283
07:19:33,240 --> 07:19:34,490
about

16527
07:25:01,620 --> 07:25:04,250
majority vote so that's cool I hope we
can do that again but like even the Idol

16528
07:25:04,250 --> 07:25:04,260
can do that again but like even the Idol
 

16529

concert Idol outfits were reused right

16530
07:25:07,070 --> 07:25:07,080
concert Idol outfits were reused right
 

16531
07:25:07,080 --> 07:25:09,708
concert Idol outfits were reused right
for many years until we got the new one

16532
07:25:09,708 --> 07:25:09,718
for many years until we got the new one
 

16533
07:25:09,718 --> 07:25:12,650
for many years until we got the new one
or for me the first one

16534
07:25:12,650 --> 07:25:12,660
or for me the first one
 

16535
07:25:12,660 --> 07:25:14,570
or for me the first one
um so I don't know how they'll go about

16536
07:25:14,570 --> 07:25:14,580
um so I don't know how they'll go about
 

16537
07:25:14,580 --> 07:25:16,850
um so I don't know how they'll go about
it in the future

16538
07:25:16,850 --> 07:25:16,860
it in the future
 

16539
07:25:16,860 --> 07:25:20,208

16542
07:25:22,610 --> 07:25:22,620
could be like a yearly thing but I doubt
 

16543
07:25:22,620 --> 07:25:24,530
could be like a yearly thing but I doubt
they're gonna come up with a new Idol

16544
07:25:24,530 --> 07:25:24,540
they're gonna come up with a new Idol

think back
 

16567
07:25:52,260 --> 07:25:56,270

07:25:58,610 --> 07:25:58,620
than for us obviously but uh thinking
 

16571
07:25:58,620 --> 07:26:00,468
than for us obviously but uh thinking
back on all the correspondence that we

16572
07:26:00,468 --> 07:26:00,478
back on all the correspondence that we
 

16573
07:26:00,478 --> 07:26:04,010
back on all the correspondence that we
had like checking back on everything

16574
07:26:04,010 --> 07:26:04,020
had like checking back on everything
 

16575
07:26:04,020 --> 07:26:06,468
had like checking back on everything
um yeah

16576
07:26:06,468 --> 07:26:06,478
um yeah
 

16577
07:26:06,478 --> 07:26:07,448
um yeah
yeah

16578
07:26:07,448 --> 07:26:07,458
yeah
 

16579
07:26:07,458 --> 07:26:11,628
yeah
it's a lot of work and they have to

16580
07:26:11,628 --> 07:26:11,638
it's a lot of work and they have to
 

16581
07:26:11,638 --> 07:26:15,190
it's a lot of work and they have to
create all kinds of I mean at least they

16582
07:26:15,190 --> 07:26:15,200
create all kinds of I mean at least they
 

16583
07:26:15,200 --> 07:26:19,548
create all kinds of I mean at least they
are basically all the same but they

16584
07:26:19,548 --> 07:26:19,558
are basically all the same but they
 

16585
07:26:19,558 --> 07:26:21,650
are basically all the same but they
still you know individualize them a

16586
07:26:21,650 --> 07:26:21,660
still you know individualize them a
 

16587
07:26:21,660 --> 07:26:25,208
still you know individualize them a
little bit here and there so no no

16588
07:26:25,208 --> 07:26:25,218
little bit here and there so no no
 

16589
07:26:25,218 --> 07:26:28,128
little bit here and there so no no
yeah and I really like the idol outfits

16590
07:26:28,128 --> 07:26:28,138
yeah and I really like the idol outfits
 

16591
07:26:28,138 --> 07:26:29,750
yeah and I really like the idol outfits
that we have

16592
07:26:29,750 --> 07:26:29,760
that we have
 

16593
07:26:29,760 --> 07:26:31,330
that we have
so

16594
07:26:31,330 --> 07:26:31,340
so
 

16595
07:26:31,340 --> 07:26:34,190
so
if if we were like you know real people

16596
07:26:34,190 --> 07:26:34,200
if if we were like you know real people
 

16597
07:26:34,200 --> 07:26:36,230
if if we were like you know real people
and you could just saw an outfit it

16598
07:26:36,230 --> 07:26:36,240
and you could just saw an outfit it
 

16599
07:26:36,240 --> 07:26:38,510
and you could just saw an outfit it
would be easier but they have to be

16600
07:26:38,510 --> 07:26:38,520
would be easier but they have to be
 

16601
07:26:38,520 --> 07:26:41,750
would be easier but they have to be
modeled in 3D so it's

16602
07:26:41,750 --> 07:26:41,760
modeled in 3D so it's
 

16603
07:26:41,760 --> 07:26:45,948
modeled in 3D so it's
more work and it's more uh expensive so

16604
07:26:45,948 --> 07:26:45,958
more work and it's more uh expensive so
 

16605
07:26:45,958 --> 07:26:48,890
more work and it's more uh expensive so
not so reasonable to create so many if

16606
07:26:48,890 --> 07:26:48,900
not so reasonable to create so many if
 

16607
07:26:48,900 --> 07:26:51,410
not so reasonable to create so many if
we were only like five people

16608
07:26:51,410 --> 07:26:51,420
we were only like five people
 

16609
07:26:51,420 --> 07:26:54,170
we were only like five people
and then more reasonable maybe but we're

16610
07:26:54,170 --> 07:26:54,180
and then more reasonable maybe but we're
 

16611
07:26:54,180 --> 07:26:56,150
and then more reasonable maybe but we're
we're a huge group

16612
07:26:56,150 --> 07:26:56,160
we're a huge group
 

16613
07:26:56,160 --> 07:26:58,190
we're a huge group
I mean I guess you could just copy paste

16614
07:26:58,190 --> 07:26:58,200
I mean I guess you could just copy paste
 

16615
