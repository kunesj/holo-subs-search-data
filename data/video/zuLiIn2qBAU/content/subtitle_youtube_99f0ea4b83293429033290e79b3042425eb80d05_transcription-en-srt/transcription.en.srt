be then let's go for the G one keeps it

2612
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:14,320
be then let's go for the G one keeps it
 

2613
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:17,229
be then let's go for the G one keeps it
pretty low or should I do it we'll see

2614
01:11:17,229 --> 01:11:17,239
pretty low or should I do it we'll see
 

2615
01:11:17,239 --> 01:11:18,270
pretty low or should I do it we'll see
we'll

2616
01:11:18,270 --> 01:11:18,280
we'll
 

2617
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:20,669
we'll
see what did she say what did she say 61

2618

2629
01:11:39,239 --> 01:11:43,310
m but in the real thing it's not going
to show me this result on the bottom

2630
01:11:43,310 --> 01:11:43,320
to show me this result on the bottom
 

2631
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:45,310
to show me this result on the bottom
right surely it's not going to show

2632

you know study the MC the the the the

4080
01:52:24,109 --> 01:52:24,119

you know study the MC the the the the
the script so hard if you're the MC

4103
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:57,750
but H wasn't even
there yeah so I open it and I'm

4104
01:52:57,750 --> 01:52:57,760

 

4105
01:52:57,760 --> 01:52:59,910

4111
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:14,430
breakfast I guess let's uh look at this
and study it mhm but honestly like a lot

of the others didn't check the um

4114
01:53:17,910 --> 01:53:17,920
of the others didn't check the um
 

4115
01:53:17,920 --> 01:53:21,189
of the others didn't check the um
uh I I think both Iris and celly didn't

4116
01:53:21,189 --> 01:53:21,199
uh I I think both Iris and celly didn't
 

4117
01:53:21,199 --> 01:53:24,510
uh I I think both Iris and celly didn't
check the uh script either until we like

4118
01:53:24,510 --> 01:53:24,520
check the uh script either until we like
 

4119

started

4120
01:53:26,430 --> 01:53:26,440
started
 

4121
01:53:26,440 --> 01:53:30,189
started
recording so I think it's quite quite

4122
01:53:30,189 --> 01:53:30,199
recording so I think it's quite quite
 

4123
01:53:30,199 --> 01:53:33,709
recording so I think it's quite quite
common um cuz it's really like you let

4124
01:53:33,709 --> 01:53:33,719
common um cuz it's really like you let
 

4125
01:53:33,719 --> 01:53:35,629
common um cuz it's really like you let
the MC lead it and you don't really have

4126
01:53:35,629 --> 01:53:35,639
the MC lead it and you don't really have
 

4127
01:53:35,639 --> 01:53:36,950
the MC lead it and you don't really have
to do much most of the time you're just

4128
01:53:36,950 --> 01:53:36,960
to do much most of the time you're just
 

4129
01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:41,950
to do much most of the time you're just
like reacting and stuff you know

4130
01:53:41,950 --> 01:53:41,960

 

4131
01:53:41,960 --> 01:53:46,790

mhm yeah uh yeah I was really hungry and

4132
01:53:46,790 --> 01:53:46,800

4189
01:55:06,079 --> 01:55:08,109
Discord but then additionally they want
a backup or like actually the Discord is

4190
01:55:08,109 --> 01:55:08,119

4191
01:55:08,119 --> 01:55:10,950

a backup cuz sound quality is bad so

4192
01:55:10,950 --> 01:55:10,960
a backup cuz sound quality is bad so

YouTube short I basically made like a a
little key cover so just so that I could

6006
02:43:17,150 --> 02:43:17,160
little key cover so just so that I could
 

6007
02:43:17,160 --> 02:43:20,830
little key cover so just so that I could
have something to go along with the

6008
02:43:20,830 --> 02:43:20,840
have something to go along with the
 

6009

6012
02:43:27,150 --> 02:43:27,160
and that was definitely a very very very
 

6013
02:43:27,160 --> 02:43:29,469
and that was definitely a very very very
safe way to play it but then

6014
02:43:29,469 --> 02:43:29,479
safe way to play it but then
 

6015
02:43:29,479 --> 02:43:32,389
safe way to play it but then
afterwards more and more I saw like

afterwards more and more I saw like
other whole life members

6018
02:43:34,750 --> 02:43:34,760
other whole life members
 

6019
02:43:34,760 --> 02:43:36,469

though
so uh like the safest songs that we can

6044
02:44:09,269 --> 02:44:09,279
so uh like the safest songs that we can
 

6045
02:44:09,279 --> 02:44:11,830
so uh like the safest songs that we can
pick or Japanese cuz you know rights and

6046
02:44:11,830 --> 02:44:11,840
pick or Japanese cuz you know rights and
 

6047
02:44:11,840 --> 02:44:13,830

um but yeah then it was like yeah I
guess probably if you use the music

6052
02:44:19,830 --> 02:44:19,840
guess probably if you use the music
 

6053
02:44:19,840 --> 02:44:23,429
guess probably if you use the music
library then it might be fine so I still

6054
02:44:23,429 --> 02:44:23,439
library then it might be fine so I still
 

6055
02:44:23,439 --> 02:44:25,389
library then it might be fine so I still
feel like it's kind of a gray area like

6056
02:44:25,389 --> 02:44:25,399
feel like it's kind of a gray area like
 

6057
02:44:25,399 --> 02:44:27,750
feel like it's kind of a gray area like
where we don't really have a clear

6058
02:44:27,750 --> 02:44:27,760
where we don't really have a clear
 

6059

where we don't really have a clear
instruction of what we can do and what

6060
02:44:30,110 --> 02:44:30,120
instruction of what we can do and what
