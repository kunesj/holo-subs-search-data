00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,430
then we were told that
um in within like uh like not a big

1718
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:01,440
um in within like uh like not a big
 

1719
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,990
um in within like uh like not a big
distance can quickly get there there is

1720
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:04,000
distance can quickly get there there is
 

1721
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,430
distance can quickly get there there is
a there's a an easy simple slope

1722
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:07,440
a there's a an easy simple slope
 

1723
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,030
a there's a an easy simple slope
just one

1724
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:09,040
just one
 

1725
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,670
just one
one slope that's really not not nothing

1726
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:11,680
one slope that's really not not nothing
 

1727
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,950
one slope that's really not not nothing
exciting

1728
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:12,960
exciting
 

1729
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,030
exciting
um

1730
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:15,040
um
 

1731
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,870
um
blue blue slope

1732
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:16,880
blue blue slope
 

1733
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,550
blue blue slope
blue as and there's like colors that

1734
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:20,560
blue as and there's like colors that
 

1735
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,550
blue as and there's like colors that
say how difficult the slopes are blue is

1736
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:22,560
say how difficult the slopes are blue is
 

1737
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,870
say how difficult the slopes are blue is
the easiest kind of but then there's

1738
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:24,880
the easiest kind of but then there's
 

1739
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,030
the easiest kind of but then there's
like practice slopes that are even

1740
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:27,040
like practice slopes that are even
 

1741
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,109
like practice slopes that are even
flatter than that but anyway so yeah

1742
00:41:29,109 --> 00:41:29,119
flatter than that but anyway so yeah
 

1743
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,069
flatter than that but anyway so yeah
there was one where it was not a gondola

1744

there was one where it was not a gondola
 

1745
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,069
there was one where it was not a gondola
but something where you like you you put

1746
00:41:34,069 --> 00:41:34,079
but something where you like you you put
 

1747
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:36,390
but something where you like you you put
like something like a chair in between

your legs and it will it will like pull

1750
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:39,280
your legs and it will it will like pull
 

1751
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,060
your legs and it will it will like pull
you pull you to the top of the hill

1752
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:42,070

so we were like yeah well we're already
dressed and this is probably better

1758
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:48,400
dressed and this is probably better
 

1759
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,750
dressed and this is probably better
anyway to start somewhere simple for me

1760
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:51,760
anyway to start somewhere simple for me
 

1761
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,670
anyway to start somewhere simple for me
it's like a warm-up

1762
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:53,680
it's like a warm-up
 

1763
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,470
it's like a warm-up
so

1764
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:54,480
so
 

1765
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,710
so
yeah drag lift

1766
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:56,720
yeah drag lift
 

1767
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,390
yeah drag lift
so we went

1768
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:58,400
so we went
 

1769
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,829
so we went
there

1770
00:41:59,829 --> 00:41:59,839
there
 

1771
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:04,309

00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:06,560
on the way there because i had to walk
 

1775
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,349

with that with those [\h__\h] shoes it
 

1777
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:11,349
with that with those [\h__\h] shoes it
hurts so much because you can't really

1778
00:42:11,349 --> 00:42:11,359
hurts so much because you can't really
 

1779
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:14,630
hurts so much because you can't really
like bend your knees much like your your

your legs and and then having to carry
 

1783
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,309
your legs and and then having to carry
those skis for [\h__\h] sake was so

1784

those skis for [\h__\h] sake was so
 

1785
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:22,470

exhausting and we kind of had to walk
 

1787
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,510
exhausting and we kind of had to walk
like up the hill a lot

1788
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:25,520
like up the hill a lot
 

1789

there and we got a little ticket and i
 

1795
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,589
there and we got a little ticket and i
looked at it and i was like

1796

looked at it and i was like
well it's [\h__\h] stormy but

well it's [\h__\h] stormy but
 

1799
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,190
well it's [\h__\h] stormy but
it looks like a manageable

1800
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:41,200
it looks like a manageable
 

1801
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,829
it looks like a manageable
hill i

1802
00:42:42,829 --> 00:42:42,839
hill i
 

1803
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:46,309
hill i
suppose um

1804
00:42:46,309 --> 00:42:46,319

 

1805
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:50,950

so um

1806
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:50,960

 

1807
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,790

we

1808
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:52,800
we
 

1809
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,550
we
huh

1810
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:54,560
huh
 

1811
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,270
huh
we then got ourselves dragged up

1812
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:57,280
we then got ourselves dragged up
 

1813
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,069
we then got ourselves dragged up
up the hill

1814
00:43:00,069 --> 00:43:00,079

 

1815
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:01,670

and i was standing up there and there

1816
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:01,680
and i was standing up there and there
 

1817
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,430
and i was standing up there and there
were by the way there were quite a lot

1818

especially a lot of children that came
 

1827
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,190
especially a lot of children that came
like with their school's teacher like

1828
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:15,200
like with their school's teacher like
 

1829
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,230
like with their school's teacher like
they had ski in class or whatever

they had ski in class or whatever
 

1831
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,670

but now here it is i have a photo

1832
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:21,680
but now here it is i have a photo
 

1833
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,470
but now here it is i have a photo
it doesn't really look steep

1834
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:24,480
it doesn't really look steep
 

1835
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,950
it doesn't really look steep
and probably i mean it wasn't really

1836
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:26,960
and probably i mean it wasn't really
 

1837
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:27,910
and probably i mean it wasn't really
steep

1838
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:27,920
steep
 

1839
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:28,710
steep
but

1840
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:28,720

a little bit a little bit it just
 

1845
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,950
a little bit a little bit it just
unfolds it never looks that steep

1846
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:34,960
unfolds it never looks that steep
 

1847
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,910
unfolds it never looks that steep
um but it also makes you maybe see how

can't really see how steep it is
 

1855
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:50,470

i can wake up early but it's all it was

03:39:58,469 --> 03:39:58,479
i can wake up early but it's all it was
 

9795
03:39:58,479 --> 03:40:01,349
i can wake up early but it's all it was
usually just like like one day at a time

9796
03:40:01,349 --> 03:40:01,359
usually just like like one day at a time
 

9797
03:40:01,359 --> 03:40:03,349
usually just like like one day at a time
i would have to get up early for maybe a

9798
03:40:03,349 --> 03:40:03,359
i would have to get up early for maybe a
 

9799
03:40:03,359 --> 03:40:05,429
i would have to get up early for maybe a
recording or something

9800
03:40:05,429 --> 03:40:05,439
recording or something
 

9801
03:40:05,439 --> 03:40:06,550
recording or something
and

9802
03:40:06,550 --> 03:40:06,560
and
 

9803
03:40:06,560 --> 03:40:07,590

9806
03:40:09,429 --> 03:40:09,439

9807
03:40:09,439 --> 03:40:11,910
and then the next day there's no reason
to wake up early so if you don't have a

9808
03:40:11,910 --> 03:40:11,920
to wake up early so if you don't have a
 

9809
03:40:11,920 --> 03:40:14,469
to wake up early so if you don't have a
reason then it just keeps on going back
