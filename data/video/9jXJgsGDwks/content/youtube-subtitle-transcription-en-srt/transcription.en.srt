into the wool
 

1031
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,169
into the wool
and then I left it in the in the water a

1032
00:28:15,169 --> 00:28:15,179
and then I left it in the in the water a
 

1033
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:17,269
and then I left it in the in the water a
little bit I never did this before I

little bit I never did this before I
 

1035
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,149

tried I hoped for it to work because I

1036
00:28:20,149 --> 00:28:20,159
tried I hoped for it to work because I
 

1037
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,330
tried I hoped for it to work because I
needed the colors to be more accurate

1038
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:23,340
needed the colors to be more accurate

00:29:14,149 --> 00:29:14,159
overnight
 

1075
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:17,630
overnight
um and then uh turns out it worked

1076
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:17,640
um and then uh turns out it worked
 

1077
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,269
um and then uh turns out it worked

00:29:20,269 --> 00:29:20,279
pretty well the world definitely is
 

1079
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:22,029
pretty well the world definitely is
stiffer than before

1080
00:29:22,029 --> 00:29:22,039
stiffer than before
 

1081
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:26,330
stiffer than before
and because I I didn't want the color to

1082
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:26,340
and because I I didn't want the color to
 

1083
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,430
and because I I didn't want the color to
go off I didn't even attempt to brush it

1084
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:28,440
go off I didn't even attempt to brush it
 

1085
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,110
go off I didn't even attempt to brush it
anymore

1086
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:30,120
anymore
 

1087
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:30,830
anymore
um

1088
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:30,840
um
 

1089
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:35,090

but yeah it worked and then
I used that to put it on the head I mean

1092
00:29:39,769 --> 00:29:39,779

maybe it's because a lot of us stayed at

3218
01:17:55,130 --> 01:17:55,140
maybe it's because a lot of us stayed at
 

3219
01:17:55,140 --> 01:17:58,010
maybe it's because a lot of us stayed at
home for the past two years a lot

3220
01:17:58,010 --> 01:17:58,020
home for the past two years a lot
 

3221
01:17:58,020 --> 01:18:01,310
home for the past two years a lot
and therefore we're not as immune

3222
01:18:01,310 --> 01:18:01,320
and therefore we're not as immune
 

3223
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:03,590
and therefore we're not as immune
as we could be

3224
01:18:03,590 --> 01:18:03,600
as we could be
 

3225
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:05,149
as we could be
or should be

4633
01:50:30,420 --> 01:50:31,970
recorded it with better light I regret
that a little bit

4634
01:50:31,970 --> 01:50:31,980
that a little bit
 

4635
01:50:31,980 --> 01:50:34,729
that a little bit

I had no time
 

4639
01:50:36,780 --> 01:50:46,310
I had no time
so the light is not the best

4640
01:50:46,310 --> 01:50:46,320

 

4641
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:50,510

4651
01:51:04,980 --> 01:51:08,090
Kelly's voice acting stands out so much
in this video I think

4652
01:51:08,090 --> 01:51:08,100
in this video I think
 

4653
01:51:08,100 --> 01:51:09,910
in this video I think
because she

4654
01:51:09,910 --> 01:51:09,920
because she
 

4655
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:13,609
because she
put on a really like dramatic character

4656
01:51:13,609 --> 01:51:13,619
put on a really like dramatic character
 

4657
01:51:13,619 --> 01:51:16,010
put on a really like dramatic character
voice While most of everyone else just

4658
01:51:16,010 --> 01:51:16,020
voice While most of everyone else just
 

4659
01:51:16,020 --> 01:51:20,270
voice While most of everyone else just
wasted really like normally

4660
01:51:20,270 --> 01:51:20,280

 

4661
01:51:20,280 --> 01:51:22,310

so it's gonna be a little bit of a

4662
01:51:22,310 --> 01:51:22,320
so it's gonna be a little bit of a
 

4663
01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:31,550
so it's gonna be a little bit of a
whiplash

4664
01:51:31,550 --> 01:51:31,560

 

4665
01:51:31,560 --> 01:51:35,209

she really like embodied the sock puppet

4666
01:51:35,209 --> 01:51:35,219
she really like embodied the sock puppet
 

4667
01:51:35,219 --> 01:51:54,690
she really like embodied the sock puppet
spirits

4668

uh the sock puppet one will definitely

7384
02:57:40,490 --> 02:57:40,500
uh the sock puppet one will definitely
 

7385
02:57:40,500 --> 02:57:41,650
uh the sock puppet one will definitely
go public

7386
02:57:41,650 --> 02:57:41,660
go public
 

7387
02:57:41,660 --> 02:57:44,570
go public
and the URL I guess the website will

7388
02:57:44,570 --> 02:57:44,580
and the URL I guess the website will
 

7389
02:57:44,580 --> 02:57:48,590
and the URL I guess the website will
keep it up for maybe a couple more days

7390
02:57:48,590 --> 02:57:48,600
keep it up for maybe a couple more days
 

7391
02:57:48,600 --> 02:57:50,330
keep it up for maybe a couple more days
maybe until the end of the year and then

7392
02:57:50,330 --> 02:57:50,340
maybe until the end of the year and then
 

7393
02:57:50,340 --> 02:57:52,429
maybe until the end of the year and then
I'll think we'll take the website down

7394
02:57:52,429 --> 02:57:52,439
I'll think we'll take the website down
 

7395
02:57:52,439 --> 02:57:57,590
I'll think we'll take the website down
the you the the URL I had to buy it for

7396
02:57:57,590 --> 02:57:57,600
the you the the URL I had to buy it for
 

7397
02:57:57,600 --> 02:58:00,230
the you the the URL I had to buy it for
minimum one year so it will still exist

7398
02:58:00,230 --> 02:58:00,240
minimum one year so it will still exist
 

7399
02:58:00,240 --> 02:58:03,950
minimum one year so it will still exist
but I think we will take down the the

7400
02:58:03,950 --> 02:58:03,960
but I think we will take down the the
 

7401
02:58:03,960 --> 02:58:07,849
but I think we will take down the the
website I guess because I think hosting

7402
02:58:07,849 --> 02:58:07,859
website I guess because I think hosting
 

7403
02:58:07,859 --> 02:58:10,730
website I guess because I think hosting
it endlessly or maybe it takes up

7404
02:58:10,730 --> 02:58:10,740
it endlessly or maybe it takes up
 

7405
02:58:10,740 --> 02:58:12,710
it endlessly or maybe it takes up
resources I don't know

7406
02:58:12,710 --> 02:58:12,720
resources I don't know
 

7407
02:58:12,720 --> 02:58:20,150
resources I don't know
um

7408
02:58:20,150 --> 02:58:20,160

 

7409
02:58:20,160 --> 02:58:22,429

and next year it can just be remade and

7410
02:58:22,429 --> 02:58:22,439
and next year it can just be remade and
 

7411
02:58:22,439 --> 02:58:24,410
and next year it can just be remade and
next year I will be I won't be paying

7412
02:58:24,410 --> 02:58:24,420
next year I will be I won't be paying
 

7413
02:58:24,420 --> 02:58:27,889
next year I will be I won't be paying
for the URL next year

7414
02:58:27,889 --> 02:58:27,899

 

7415
02:58:27,899 --> 02:58:31,250

no no no I will let the URL run out and

7416
02:58:31,250 --> 02:58:31,260
no no no I will let the URL run out and
 

7417
02:58:31,260 --> 02:58:34,190
no no no I will let the URL run out and
then management can try to capture the

7418
02:58:34,190 --> 02:58:34,200
then management can try to capture the
 

7419
02:58:34,200 --> 02:58:35,990
then management can try to capture the
URL themselves

7420
02:58:35,990 --> 02:58:36,000
URL themselves
 

7421
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:39,650
URL themselves
I'm not gonna pay for it again

7422
02:58:39,650 --> 02:58:39,660

 

7423
02:58:39,660 --> 02:58:42,349

yeah

7424
02:58:42,349 --> 02:58:42,359

 

7425
02:58:42,359 --> 02:58:44,570

easy it wasn't expensive anyway the URL

7426
02:58:44,570 --> 02:58:44,580
easy it wasn't expensive anyway the URL
 

7427
02:58:44,580 --> 02:58:48,590
easy it wasn't expensive anyway the URL
so they should be able to pay for it

7428
02:58:48,590 --> 02:58:48,600

 

7429
02:58:48,600 --> 02:58:51,050
