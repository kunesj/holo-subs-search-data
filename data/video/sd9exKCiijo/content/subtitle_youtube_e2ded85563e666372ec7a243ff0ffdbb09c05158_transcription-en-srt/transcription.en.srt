couldn't get any more shift cards so it

290
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:39,060
couldn't get any more shift cards so it
 

291
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,550
couldn't get any more shift cards so it

292
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:40,560
said it was always having poison cards
 

293
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,389
said it was always having poison cards
so as I kind of like did like a mix

294
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:44,399
so as I kind of like did like a mix
 

295
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:45,230
so as I kind of like did like a mix
um

296
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:45,240
um
 

297
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,630
um
yeah it's a like all of them I didn't

298
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:47,640
yeah it's a like all of them I didn't
 

299
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,650
yeah it's a like all of them I didn't
want to I wanted to go forever or and

300
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:51,660
want to I wanted to go forever or and
 

301
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,030
want to I wanted to go forever or and
then in the beginning I got the shift

302
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:53,040
then in the beginning I got the shift
 

303
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,769
then in the beginning I got the shift
cards but no poison cards and then later

304
00:10:54,769 --> 00:10:54,779
cards but no poison cards and then later
 

305
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,590
cards but no poison cards and then later
I got only poison cards so

306
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:57,600
I got only poison cards so
 

307
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,410
I got only poison cards so
I tried my best to mix it somehow but

308
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:00,420
I tried my best to mix it somehow but
 

309
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,269
I tried my best to mix it somehow but
now it's a little bit more heavy on the

310
00:11:02,269 --> 00:11:02,279
now it's a little bit more heavy on the
 

311
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:05,090
now it's a little bit more heavy on the
poison side because Helia poison is the

312
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:05,100
poison side because Helia poison is the
 

313
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,610
poison side because Helia poison is the
best okay so I would say we'll go for

314
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:07,620
best okay so I would say we'll go for
 

315
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,069

this whole year I wasted so much time
 

9111
04:18:07,020 --> 04:18:10,309
this whole year I wasted so much time
waiting for that one appointment then it

9112
04:18:10,309 --> 04:18:10,319
waiting for that one appointment then it
 

9113
04:18:10,319 --> 04:18:12,650
waiting for that one appointment then it
overlapped with my America trip so I had

9114
04:18:12,650 --> 04:18:12,660
overlapped with my America trip so I had
 

9115
04:18:12,660 --> 04:18:14,809
overlapped with my America trip so I had
to move it again for uh the next

9116
04:18:14,809 --> 04:18:14,819
to move it again for uh the next
 

9117
04:18:14,819 --> 04:18:16,130
to move it again for uh the next
appointment was like I don't know four

9118
04:18:16,130 --> 04:18:16,140
appointment was like I don't know four
 

9119
04:18:16,140 --> 04:18:18,530
appointment was like I don't know four
or five months later and that was like

9120
04:18:18,530 --> 04:18:18,540
or five months later and that was like
 

9121
04:18:18,540 --> 04:18:22,010
or five months later and that was like
last month or the month before

9122
