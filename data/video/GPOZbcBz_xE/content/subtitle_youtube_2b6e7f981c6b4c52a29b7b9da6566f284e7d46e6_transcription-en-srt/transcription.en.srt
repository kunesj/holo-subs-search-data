01:11:16,430 --> 01:11:16,440
overextend so she wouldn't have been in
 

2553
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:19,950
overextend so she wouldn't have been in
that position in the first place if she

2554
01:11:19,950 --> 01:11:19,960
that position in the first place if she
 

2555
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:23,630
that position in the first place if she
was watching a map she when I'm in the

2559
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:28,630

middle should I tell
 

2561
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:32,590
middle should I tell
you when I'm about to engage I think

2562
01:11:32,590 --> 01:11:32,600
you when I'm about to engage I think
 

2563
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:36,310
you when I'm about to engage I think
it's up to the jungler because it's like

01:11:36,310 --> 01:11:36,320
it's up to the jungler because it's like
 

2565
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:39,030
it's up to the jungler because it's like
um they usually evaluate the kill

2566
01:11:39,030 --> 01:11:39,040
um they usually evaluate the kill
 

2567
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:41,350
um they usually evaluate the kill
potential if you if like if they went

2568
01:11:41,350 --> 01:11:41,360
potential if you if like if they went
 

2569
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:44,750
potential if you if like if they went
mid would you guys be able to get a kill

2570
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:44,760
mid would you guys be able to get a kill
 

2571
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:47,189
mid would you guys be able to get a kill
mhm or if there's like other objectives

2572
01:11:47,189 --> 01:11:47,199
mhm or if there's like other objectives
 

2573
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:49,350
mhm or if there's like other objectives
cuz even though you might engage they

2574
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:49,360
cuz even though you might engage they
 

2575
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:50,870
cuz even though you might engage they
like oh it's not worth it cuz I have to

2576
01:11:50,870 --> 01:11:50,880
like oh it's not worth it cuz I have to
 

2577
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,629
like oh it's not worth it cuz I have to
go to this other place right now and it

2578
01:11:53,629 --> 01:11:53,639
go to this other place right now and it
 

2579
01:11:53,639 --> 01:11:56,950
go to this other place right now and it
would waste too much time here I wanted

2580
01:11:56,950 --> 01:11:56,960
would waste too much time here I wanted
 

2581
01:11:56,960 --> 01:12:00,669
would waste too much time here I wanted
