something like that again i need to go
to

182
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:50,000
to
 

183
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,350
to
a studio and it's not as i said before

184
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:53,360
a studio and it's not as i said before
 

185
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,029
a studio and it's not as i said before
it's not just walking in there saying

186
00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:55,039
it's not just walking in there saying
 

187
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,790
it's not just walking in there saying
hello and then and then doing 3d bam

188
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:58,800
hello and then and then doing 3d bam
 

189
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,350
hello and then and then doing 3d bam
it's a bit more complicated like that

190
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:01,360
it's a bit more complicated like that
 

191
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,390
it's a bit more complicated like that
and quite quite a bit more complicated

192
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:04,400
and quite quite a bit more complicated
 

193
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,029
and quite quite a bit more complicated
um so preparation is necessary for

194
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:07,039
um so preparation is necessary for
 

195
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,950
um so preparation is necessary for
whenever i want to do something like

196
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:08,960
whenever i want to do something like
 

197
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,550
whenever i want to do something like
that because i just don't have the

uh have like tracking on like for
 

11301
04:37:02,240 --> 04:37:05,429
uh have like tracking on like for
example uh you know how um ina has like

11302
04:37:05,429 --> 04:37:05,439
example uh you know how um ina has like
 

11303
04:37:05,439 --> 04:37:06,310
example uh you know how um ina has like
a

11304

a little animation of a drawing tablet

11308
04:37:10,709 --> 04:37:10,719
a little animation of a drawing tablet
 

11309
04:37:10,719 --> 04:37:13,189
a little animation of a drawing tablet
uh with her hand moving

11310
04:37:13,189 --> 04:37:13,199
uh with her hand moving
 

11311
04:37:13,199 --> 04:37:15,510
uh with her hand moving
okay she kind of made that herself but

11312
04:37:15,510 --> 04:37:15,520
okay she kind of made that herself but
 

11313
04:37:15,520 --> 04:37:17,189
okay she kind of made that herself but
we'll be able to do stuff like that and

11314
04:37:17,189 --> 04:37:17,199
we'll be able to do stuff like that and
 

11315
04:37:17,199 --> 04:37:19,029
we'll be able to do stuff like that and
with controllers and and keyboard and

11316
04:37:19,029 --> 04:37:19,039
with controllers and and keyboard and
 

11317
04:37:19,039 --> 04:37:20,070
with controllers and and keyboard and
mouse

11318

04:37:21,750 --> 04:37:21,760
and
 

11321
04:37:21,760 --> 04:37:23,990
and
implement it into our model

11322
04:37:23,990 --> 04:37:24,000
implement it into our model
 

11323
04:37:24,000 --> 04:37:26,150
implement it into our model
like it doesn't have to be like stuff

11324
04:37:26,150 --> 04:37:26,160
like it doesn't have to be like stuff
 

11325
04:37:26,160 --> 04:37:30,470
like it doesn't have to be like stuff
that the fans made for us or whatever

11326
04:37:30,470 --> 04:37:30,480

 

11327
04:37:30,480 --> 04:37:33,029

you can already see some samples

11328
04:37:33,029 --> 04:37:33,039
you can already see some samples
 

11329
04:37:33,039 --> 04:37:37,830
you can already see some samples
from matsuri senpai hatama and so on

11330
04:37:37,830 --> 04:37:37,840
from matsuri senpai hatama and so on
 

11331
04:37:37,840 --> 04:37:39,349
from matsuri senpai hatama and so on
because they were

11332
04:37:39,349 --> 04:37:39,359
because they were
 

11333
04:37:39,359 --> 04:37:41,189
because they were
showcased in the

11334
04:37:41,189 --> 04:37:41,199
showcased in the
 

11335
04:37:41,199 --> 04:37:42,470
showcased in the

showcase yeah
 

11339
04:37:44,879 --> 04:37:47,029
showcase yeah
yeah keyboards and stuff i think it will

11340
04:37:47,029 --> 04:37:47,039
yeah keyboards and stuff i think it will
 

11341
04:37:47,039 --> 04:37:49,269
yeah keyboards and stuff i think it will
track the input of what buttons we push

11342
04:37:49,269 --> 04:37:49,279
track the input of what buttons we push
 

11343
04:37:49,279 --> 04:37:51,670
track the input of what buttons we push
and all that and how we move the mouse

11344
04:37:51,670 --> 04:37:51,680
and all that and how we move the mouse
 

11345
04:37:51,680 --> 04:37:53,590
and all that and how we move the mouse
and all that yeah
