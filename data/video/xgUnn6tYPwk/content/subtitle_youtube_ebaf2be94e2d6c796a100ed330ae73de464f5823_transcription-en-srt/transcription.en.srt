721
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,990
now should make some pickaxes too oh
yeah mhm I have them iron one I still

722
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:30,000
yeah mhm I have them iron one I still
 

723
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,750
yeah mhm I have them iron one I still
think iron pickaxes are for the best I

724
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:31,760
think iron pickaxes are for the best I
 

725
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,230
think iron pickaxes are for the best I
think I think we for normal mining we

726
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:35,240
think I think we for normal mining we
 

727
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,909
think I think we for normal mining we
can use the stone ones but if there's

728
00:25:36,909 --> 00:25:36,919
can use the stone ones but if there's
 

729
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:38,669
can use the stone ones but if there's
like a resource like gold or something

730
00:25:38,669 --> 00:25:38,679
like a resource like gold or something
 

731
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:42,980
like a resource like gold or something
we can use the iron one mm good

732
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:42,990

okay cool then we'll put Cobblestone
 

9425
03:53:41,720 --> 03:53:44,550
okay cool then we'll put Cobblestone
under where the the water trenches mhm

9426
03:53:44,550 --> 03:53:44,560
under where the the water trenches mhm
 

9427
03:53:44,560 --> 03:53:50,990
under where the the water trenches mhm
mhm cobbly Stone Cobin
