way that's DMC controls yeah a lot of
 

13170
06:32:15,520 --> 06:32:19,190
way that's DMC controls yeah a lot of
games have such a

13171
06:32:19,190 --> 06:32:19,200

 

13172
06:32:19,200 --> 06:32:22,190

system you

13173
06:32:22,190 --> 06:32:22,200
system you
 

13174
06:32:22,200 --> 06:32:29,990
system you
relate this more

13175
06:32:29,990 --> 06:32:30,000

 

13176
06:32:30,000 --> 06:32:35,430

the Pro

13177
06:32:35,430 --> 06:32:35,440

 

13178
06:32:35,440 --> 06:32:37,628

Controller I don't

13179
06:32:37,628 --> 06:32:37,638
Controller I don't
 

13180
06:32:37,638 --> 06:32:40,948
Controller I don't
know is it so much better you can remap

13181
06:32:40,948 --> 06:32:40,958
know is it so much better you can remap
 

13182
06:32:40,958 --> 06:32:42,990
know is it so much better you can remap
the buttons I but I'm already getting

13183
06:32:42,990 --> 06:32:43,000
the buttons I but I'm already getting
 

13184
06:32:43,000 --> 06:32:45,230
the buttons I but I'm already getting
used to these ones I don't know I'll

13185
06:32:45,230 --> 06:32:45,240
used to these ones I don't know I'll
 

13186
06:32:45,240 --> 06:32:46,270
used to these ones I don't know I'll
think about

13187
06:32:46,270 --> 06:32:46,280
think about
 

13188
06:32:46,280 --> 06:32:51,910
think about
it generally generally it's

13189
06:32:51,910 --> 06:32:51,920

 

13190
06:32:51,920 --> 06:32:55,070

fine I'll probably

13191
06:32:55,070 --> 06:32:55,080
fine I'll probably
 

13192
06:32:55,080 --> 06:32:59,230
fine I'll probably
be able to have faster battles when I

13193
06:32:59,230 --> 06:32:59,240
be able to have faster battles when I
 

13194
06:32:59,240 --> 06:33:00,708
be able to have faster battles when I
fight more

13195
06:33:00,708 --> 06:33:00,718
fight more
 

13196
06:33:00,718 --> 06:33:04,270
fight more
efficiently with better

13197
06:33:04,270 --> 06:33:04,280
efficiently with better
 

13198
06:33:04,280 --> 06:33:08,350
efficiently with better

controllers are you saying maybe my

13201
06:33:10,590 --> 06:33:10,600
controllers are you saying maybe my
 

13202
06:33:10,600 --> 06:33:14,350
controllers are you saying maybe my
hands are too small and these are not

13203
06:33:14,350 --> 06:33:14,360
hands are too small and these are not
 

13204
06:33:14,360 --> 06:33:16,948
hands are too small and these are not
made this controll let me compare to my

13205
06:33:16,948 --> 06:33:16,958
made this controll let me compare to my
 

13206
06:33:16,958 --> 06:33:18,910
made this controll let me compare to my
switch

13207
06:33:18,910 --> 06:33:18,920
switch
 

13208
06:33:18,920 --> 06:33:21,388
switch
controller do they

13209
06:33:21,388 --> 06:33:21,398
controller do they
 

13210
06:33:21,398 --> 06:33:23,590
controller do they
touch oh the switch controller is

13211
06:33:23,590 --> 06:33:23,600
touch oh the switch controller is
 

13212
06:33:23,600 --> 06:33:26,708
touch oh the switch controller is
definitely smaller

13213
06:33:26,708 --> 06:33:26,718

 

13214
06:33:26,718 --> 06:33:29,150

but or at least

13215
06:33:29,150 --> 06:33:29,160
but or at least
 

13216
06:33:29,160 --> 06:33:33,548
but or at least
like from the length it's like

13217
06:33:33,548 --> 06:33:33,558
like from the length it's like
 

13218
06:33:33,558 --> 06:33:35,990
like from the length it's like
similar but something about them is

13219
06:33:35,990 --> 06:33:36,000
similar but something about them is
 

13220
06:33:36,000 --> 06:33:38,110
similar but something about them is
different it doesn't look as

13221
06:33:38,110 --> 06:33:38,120
different it doesn't look as
 

13222
06:33:38,120 --> 06:33:40,510
different it doesn't look as
bulky and this is a Pro Controller I

13223
06:33:40,510 --> 06:33:40,520
bulky and this is a Pro Controller I
 

13224
06:33:40,520 --> 06:33:43,708
bulky and this is a Pro Controller I
think right is it yeah my Pro Controller

13225
06:33:43,708 --> 06:33:43,718
think right is it yeah my Pro Controller
 

13226
06:33:43,718 --> 06:33:47,150
think right is it yeah my Pro Controller
is just not as bulky looking I think I

13227
06:33:47,150 --> 06:33:47,160
is just not as bulky looking I think I
 

13228
06:33:47,160 --> 06:33:48,430
is just not as bulky looking I think I
don't
