to match the frequencies or something
 

1053
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,909
to match the frequencies or something
yeah let's try to do that hold on I hear

1054

he only says out there
 

1061
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:04,970

try to try to speed up the frequency or

1062
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:04,980
try to try to speed up the frequency or
 

1063
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,090
try to try to speed up the frequency or
like uh

1064
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:07,100
like uh
 

1065
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:10,070
like uh
which one is the speeding up go back one

1066
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:10,080
which one is the speeding up go back one
 

1067

all right
so you can see the different frequency

1118
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:40,740
so you can see the different frequency
 

1119
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:43,190
so you can see the different frequency
stuff and then try matching it I don't

1120
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:43,200
stuff and then try matching it I don't
 

1121

1427
00:37:51,859 --> 00:37:54,589
let's let's see what the next one is
Delta 195.

1428
00:37:54,589 --> 00:37:54,599
Delta 195.
 

1429
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:56,270
Delta 195.
a gathering they're going to use the

1430
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:56,280
a gathering they're going to use the
 

1431
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,349
a gathering they're going to use the
machine we could just do with our eyes

1432
00:37:57,349 --> 00:37:57,359
machine we could just do with our eyes
 

1433
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,650
machine we could just do with our eyes
Delta 195 and the second coordinate and

1434
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:00,660
Delta 195 and the second coordinate and
 

1435
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,750
Delta 195 and the second coordinate and
that's that's from the bottom the third

1436
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:02,760
that's that's from the bottom the third
 

1437
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,290
that's that's from the bottom the third
one

1438
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:03,300

that is from the left the fifth one
 

1449
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:23,450
that is from the left the fifth one
okay I guess that's the radio tower yeah

1450
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:23,460
okay I guess that's the radio tower yeah
 

1451

00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,450
so we have the the tower the kids from
the rose and what was the first one

1472
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:53,460
the rose and what was the first one
 

1473
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:57,530
the rose and what was the first one
oh uh Scott's Hut okay okay all right

1474

I don't know

1478
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:03,320

 

1479
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,870

should we go there first but the closest

1480
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:05,880
should we go there first but the closest
 

1481
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,250
should we go there first but the closest
is a tower

1482
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:07,260
is a tower
 

1483
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,230
is a tower
I think we need to refuel first but now

1484
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:09,240
I think we need to refuel first but now
 

1485
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,030
I think we need to refuel first but now
at least we have wait let me listen to

1486
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:11,040
at least we have wait let me listen to
 

1487
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,890
at least we have wait let me listen to
this again why didn't they give us free

1488
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:12,900
this again why didn't they give us free
 

1489
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:17,450
this again why didn't they give us free
coordinates if if there are one place

1490
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:17,460
coordinates if if there are one place
 

1491
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:20,170
coordinates if if there are one place
or are they in the middle of that

1492
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:20,180
or are they in the middle of that
 

1493
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:22,490
or are they in the middle of that
does this mean that they are in the

1494
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:22,500
does this mean that they are in the
 

1495
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,349
does this mean that they are in the
middle of that because they gave us free

1496
00:39:24,349 --> 00:39:24,359
middle of that because they gave us free
 

1497
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:27,230
middle of that because they gave us free
coordinates free places

1498
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:27,240
coordinates free places
 

1499
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,210
coordinates free places
and then that would mean that they are

1500
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:29,220
and then that would mean that they are
 

1501
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:32,270
and then that would mean that they are
at the ancient structure but I don't I

1502
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:32,280
at the ancient structure but I don't I
 

1503
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,130
at the ancient structure but I don't I
don't know

1504
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:33,140
don't know
 

1505
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:36,609
don't know
whoa I'll Trust you on this one okay

1506
00:39:36,609 --> 00:39:36,619
whoa I'll Trust you on this one okay
 

1507
00:39:36,619 --> 00:39:40,849
whoa I'll Trust you on this one okay
uh what does that mean triangle uh am I

1508
00:39:40,849 --> 00:39:40,859
uh what does that mean triangle uh am I
 

1509
00:39:40,859 --> 00:39:43,970
uh what does that mean triangle uh am I
going to the far away fuel thingy the

1510
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:43,980
going to the far away fuel thingy the
 

1511
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:48,650
going to the far away fuel thingy the
levers and then you stand the one inside

1512
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:48,660

 

1513
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:52,030

which I actually correct

1514
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:52,040
which I actually correct
 

1515
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:55,849
which I actually correct
okay so uh on the fuel levers I don't

1516
00:39:55,849 --> 00:39:55,859
okay so uh on the fuel levers I don't
 

1517
00:39:55,859 --> 00:39:57,410
okay so uh on the fuel levers I don't
know if it's fuel I'm just gonna call it

1518
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:57,420
know if it's fuel I'm just gonna call it
 

1519
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:59,630
know if it's fuel I'm just gonna call it
that there's uh

1520
00:39:59,630 --> 00:39:59,640
that there's uh
 

1521
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,329
that there's uh
each thing has like a each lever has a

1522
00:40:02,329 --> 00:40:02,339
each thing has like a each lever has a
 

1523
00:40:02,339 --> 00:40:06,170
each thing has like a each lever has a
number so there's five seven eight four

1524
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:06,180
number so there's five seven eight four
 

1525
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:10,130
number so there's five seven eight four
seven eight uh so I guess just tell me

1526
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:10,140
seven eight uh so I guess just tell me
 

1527
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:13,010
seven eight uh so I guess just tell me
the levels for it maybe I have minus

1528
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:13,020
the levels for it maybe I have minus
 

1529
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:17,329
the levels for it maybe I have minus
eight minus four minus four

1530
00:40:17,329 --> 00:40:17,339

 

1531
00:40:17,339 --> 00:40:20,690

on on the three levels but on the on the

1532
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:20,700
on on the three levels but on the on the
 

1533
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,190
on on the three levels but on the on the
thingy

1534
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:22,200
thingy
 

1535
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,849
thingy
on the big tank that's oh well now it's

1536
00:40:25,849 --> 00:40:25,859
on the big tank that's oh well now it's
 

1537
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:28,309
on the big tank that's oh well now it's
filled up oh actually

1538
00:40:28,309 --> 00:40:28,319
filled up oh actually
 

1539
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:29,809
filled up oh actually
I think we have to get into that green

1540
00:40:29,809 --> 00:40:29,819
I think we have to get into that green
 

1541
00:40:29,819 --> 00:40:31,730
I think we have to get into that green
line huh after the green line okay then

1542
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:31,740
line huh after the green line okay then
 

1543
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,730
line huh after the green line okay then

Lowell
 

1545
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:36,170
Lowell
or do I have to do so I probably also

1546
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:36,180
or do I have to do so I probably also
 

1547
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:36,770
or do I have to do so I probably also
have to do something

1548
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:36,780
have to do something
 

1549
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,030
have to do something
[Music]

1550
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:38,040
[Music]
 

1551
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:41,809
[Music]
that I'm changing the eight

1552
00:40:41,809 --> 00:40:41,819

 

1553
00:40:41,819 --> 00:40:46,309

how's it now ah Wayne

1554
00:40:46,309 --> 00:40:46,319
how's it now ah Wayne
 

1555
00:40:46,319 --> 00:41:00,970
how's it now ah Wayne
oh [\h__\h] oh yeah

1556
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:00,980

 

1557
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:03,770

we we're still a little bit a little bit

1558
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:03,780
we we're still a little bit a little bit
 

1559
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:07,190
we we're still a little bit a little bit
above green so I don't know what were

1560
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:07,200
above green so I don't know what were
 

1561
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,829
above green so I don't know what were
the numbers again uh minus eight minus

1562
00:41:09,829 --> 00:41:09,839
the numbers again uh minus eight minus
 

1563
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:12,650
the numbers again uh minus eight minus
four minus four

1564
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:12,660

 

1565
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:15,349

but I turned down minus four and then it

1566
00:41:15,349 --> 00:41:15,359
but I turned down minus four and then it
 

1567
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:18,170
but I turned down minus four and then it
went down uh a little bit from nine to

1568
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:18,180
went down uh a little bit from nine to
 

1569
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,990
went down uh a little bit from nine to
eight

1570
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:20,000
eight
 

1571
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,970
eight
but we need to go to Six

1572
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:24,980

 

1573
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:27,589

let's swap now that now that we have

1574
00:41:27,589 --> 00:41:27,599
let's swap now that now that we have
 

1575
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,770
let's swap now that now that we have
seen these let's swap okay

1576
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:30,780
seen these let's swap okay
 

1577
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:34,010
seen these let's swap okay
where is she apparently math is involved

1578
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:34,020
where is she apparently math is involved
 

1579
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:37,250
where is she apparently math is involved
so let's uh oh no

1580
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:37,260
so let's uh oh no
 

1581
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:39,349
so let's uh oh no
wait where were you originally I forgot

1582
00:41:39,349 --> 00:41:39,359
wait where were you originally I forgot
 

1583
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,930
wait where were you originally I forgot
where that place was and the gates yeah

1584
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:41,940
where that place was and the gates yeah
 

1585
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:45,829
where that place was and the gates yeah
over here ah there okay

1586
00:41:45,829 --> 00:41:45,839
over here ah there okay
 

1587
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,410
over here ah there okay
yeah

1588
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:47,420
yeah
 

1589
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:49,670
yeah
okay so maybe

1590
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:49,680
okay so maybe
 

1591
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,069
okay so maybe
um

1592
00:41:51,069 --> 00:41:51,079
um
 

1593
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:56,210
um
okay it's math so oh by the way

1594
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:56,220

 

1595
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:59,750

huh I saw you dashing how did you dash

1596
00:41:59,750 --> 00:41:59,760
huh I saw you dashing how did you dash
 

1597
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,349
huh I saw you dashing how did you dash
oh let's shift

1598
00:42:03,349 --> 00:42:03,359

 

1599
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:06,170

oh thank you

1600
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:06,180
oh thank you
 

1601
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:10,670
oh thank you
okay ah okay so I think if the maximum

1602
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:10,680
okay ah okay so I think if the maximum
 

1603
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:14,270
okay ah okay so I think if the maximum
number is nine then maybe put like uh

1604
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:14,280
number is nine then maybe put like uh
 

1605
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,309
number is nine then maybe put like uh
I think the next one oh okay so we have

1606
00:42:16,309 --> 00:42:16,319
I think the next one oh okay so we have
 

1607
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:18,349
I think the next one oh okay so we have
to get the max yeah yeah okay

1608
00:42:18,349 --> 00:42:18,359
to get the max yeah yeah okay
 

1609
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:21,430
to get the max yeah yeah okay
okay

1610
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:21,440

 

1611
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:27,849

I totally get it that's all I get it

1612
00:42:27,849 --> 00:42:27,859

 

1613
00:42:27,859 --> 00:42:31,670

okay uh add

1614
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:31,680
okay uh add
 

1615
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,609
okay uh add
um

1616
00:42:34,609 --> 00:42:34,619

 

1617
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:37,190

I just just add try adding uh I don't

1618
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:37,200
I just just add try adding uh I don't
 

1619
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,130
I just just add try adding uh I don't
know I'm not good at math but

1620
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:40,140
know I'm not good at math but
 

1621
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,410
know I'm not good at math but
essentially the maximum number on this

1622
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:42,420
essentially the maximum number on this
 

1623
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:46,069
essentially the maximum number on this
one is nine and so I can only minus four

1624
00:42:46,069 --> 00:42:46,079
one is nine and so I can only minus four
 

1625
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:49,130
one is nine and so I can only minus four
twice and minus eight once educated with

1626
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:49,140
twice and minus eight once educated with
 

1627
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:51,109
twice and minus eight once educated with
Detective Watson isn't the maximum

1628
00:42:51,109 --> 00:42:51,119
Detective Watson isn't the maximum
 

1629
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:53,089
Detective Watson isn't the maximum
number actually 10 it's just not written

1630
00:42:53,089 --> 00:42:53,099
number actually 10 it's just not written
 

1631
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:54,589
number actually 10 it's just not written
there because they can't put in so many

1632
00:42:54,589 --> 00:42:54,599
there because they can't put in so many
 

1633
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:56,450
there because they can't put in so many
numbers yeah yeah you're right you're

1634
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:56,460
numbers yeah yeah you're right you're
 

1635
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:58,370
numbers yeah yeah you're right you're
right actually okay and now it would be

1636
00:42:58,370 --> 00:42:58,380
right actually okay and now it would be
 

1637
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:00,770
right actually okay and now it would be
at one six

1638
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:00,780
at one six
 

1639
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,870
at one six
uh I didn't minus anything but yeah if I

1640
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:02,880
uh I didn't minus anything but yeah if I
 

1641
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,910
uh I didn't minus anything but yeah if I
minus four then it'll be at six oh no

1642
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:04,920
minus four then it'll be at six oh no
 

1643
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,710
minus four then it'll be at six oh no
okay wait because I think I put more

1644
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:06,720
okay wait because I think I put more
 

1645
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,390
okay wait because I think I put more
than ten in so I think you can only see

1646
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:08,400
than ten in so I think you can only see
 

1647
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,130
than ten in so I think you can only see
10 but technically all the other numbers

1648
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:10,140
10 but technically all the other numbers
 

1649
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:12,230
10 but technically all the other numbers
that you put in also affect it because

1650
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:12,240
that you put in also affect it because
 

1651
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,230
that you put in also affect it because
on minus four it goes to eight

1652
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:15,240
on minus four it goes to eight
 

1653
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:18,170
on minus four it goes to eight
oh

1654
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:18,180
oh
 

1655
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:20,089
oh
yeah because the numbers I put in right

1656
00:43:20,089 --> 00:43:20,099
yeah because the numbers I put in right
 

1657
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:23,030
yeah because the numbers I put in right
now are eight and four I understand I

1658
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:23,040
now are eight and four I understand I
 

1659
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,309
now are eight and four I understand I
understand I understand

1660
00:43:25,309 --> 00:43:25,319
understand I understand
 

1661
00:43:25,319 --> 00:43:28,730
understand I understand
it's it's at eight now we say

1662
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:28,740
it's it's at eight now we say
 

1663
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:31,190
it's it's at eight now we say
uh yeah because I minus four yeah I took

1664
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:31,200
uh yeah because I minus four yeah I took
 

1665
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,829
uh yeah because I minus four yeah I took
that four eight eight eight and she can

1666
00:43:33,829 --> 00:43:33,839
that four eight eight eight and she can
 

1667
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:35,990
that four eight eight eight and she can
she can also minus she can minus four

1668
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:36,000
she can also minus she can minus four
 

1669
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,410
she can also minus she can minus four
once and minus something more than that

1670
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:38,420
once and minus something more than that
 

1671
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:40,250
once and minus something more than that
so eight

1672
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:40,260
so eight
 

1673
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:43,210
so eight
eight plus

1674
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:43,220
eight plus
 

1675
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:46,730
eight plus
uh wait we gotta go to ten dollars wait

1676
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:46,740
uh wait we gotta go to ten dollars wait
 

1677
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:48,109
uh wait we gotta go to ten dollars wait
so which number do we want it to be

1678
00:43:48,109 --> 00:43:48,119
so which number do we want it to be
 

1679
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:50,210
so which number do we want it to be
again not ten right we want it to be at

1680
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:50,220
again not ten right we want it to be at
 

1681
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:53,809
again not ten right we want it to be at
five right it's at six six okay we want

1682
00:43:53,809 --> 00:43:53,819
five right it's at six six okay we want
 

1683
00:43:53,819 --> 00:43:57,349
five right it's at six six okay we want
it to be at six and it's now at eight

1684
00:43:57,349 --> 00:43:57,359

on top of it
 

2405
01:03:53,339 --> 01:03:55,910
on top of it
I think

2406
01:03:55,910 --> 01:03:55,920
I think
 

2407
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:59,829
I think
yep no problem

2408
01:03:59,829 --> 01:03:59,839

 

2409
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:04,010

this is so quite difficult

2410
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:04,020
this is so quite difficult
 

2411
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:07,670
this is so quite difficult
those I wonder if uh

2412
01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:07,680
those I wonder if uh
 

2413
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:10,549
those I wonder if uh
the game ends when we reach the middle

2414
01:04:10,549 --> 01:04:10,559
the game ends when we reach the middle
 

2415
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:12,650
the game ends when we reach the middle
all right uh the only way I can get back

2416
01:04:12,650 --> 01:04:12,660
all right uh the only way I can get back
 

2417
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:14,870
all right uh the only way I can get back
down is through the dynamite elevator

down is through the dynamite elevator
 

2419
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:16,789
down is through the dynamite elevator
uh so I guess we need to find a way

2420
01:04:16,789 --> 01:04:16,799
uh so I guess we need to find a way
 

2421
01:04:16,799 --> 01:04:18,890
uh so I guess we need to find a way
where

2422
01:04:18,890 --> 01:04:18,900
where
 

2423
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:21,890
where
uh you're in the minecart one and then

2424
01:04:21,890 --> 01:04:21,900
uh you're in the minecart one and then
 

2425

you would have to bring me the minecart

2434
01:04:33,529 --> 01:04:33,539
you would have to bring me the minecart
 

2435
01:04:33,539 --> 01:04:39,470
you would have to bring me the minecart
one back up that's right

um
 

2443
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:55,809
um
so on this level that we're currently on

2444
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:55,819
so on this level that we're currently on
 

2445
01:04:55,819 --> 01:05:00,890
so on this level that we're currently on
the by the the pickaxe elevator is two

2446
01:05:00,890 --> 01:05:00,900
the by the the pickaxe elevator is two
 

2447
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:04,010
the by the the pickaxe elevator is two
two yeah I think two levels of both no

2448

01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:07,730
two yeah I think two levels of both no
one level above me one level I think

2450
01:05:07,730 --> 01:05:07,740
one level above me one level I think

the only one I can access uh might be
the dinosaur one but I don't even think

there's a rock blocking it and uh

there's a rock blocking it and uh
 

3957
01:44:05,820 --> 01:44:07,609
there's a rock blocking it and uh
because there's a rock blocking it means

3958
01:44:07,609 --> 01:44:07,619
because there's a rock blocking it means
 

3959
01:44:07,619 --> 01:44:08,870
because there's a rock blocking it means
that it has to be turned a certain way

3960
01:44:08,870 --> 01:44:08,880
that it has to be turned a certain way
 

3961
01:44:08,880 --> 01:44:10,490

3964
01:44:14,090 --> 01:44:14,100
other side right so I think if we if I
 

3965
01:44:14,100 --> 01:44:16,910

keep going around or if I turn it the

01:44:16,910 --> 01:44:16,920
keep going around or if I turn it the
 

3967
01:44:16,920 --> 01:44:18,890
keep going around or if I turn it the
correct way and then get into it on the

01:44:18,890 --> 01:44:18,900
correct way and then get into it on the
 

3969

there's nothing here it's just
so we have to find out the red pattern

4400
01:55:56,810 --> 01:55:56,820
so we have to find out the red pattern
 

4401
01:55:56,820 --> 01:55:58,370
so we have to find out the red pattern
but what hints do we have only that

4402
01:55:58,370 --> 01:55:58,380
but what hints do we have only that
 

4403
01:55:58,380 --> 01:56:00,820
but what hints do we have only that
there is star and Sun there and

4404
01:56:00,820 --> 01:56:00,830
there is star and Sun there and
 

4405
01:56:00,830 --> 01:56:02,830
there is star and Sun there and

[Music]
 

4407
01:56:02,840 --> 01:56:07,370
[Music]
okay I I'm not sure what this is

4408
01:56:07,370 --> 01:56:07,380
okay I I'm not sure what this is
 

4409
01:56:07,380 --> 01:56:08,930
okay I I'm not sure what this is
supposed to tell us

4410
01:56:08,930 --> 01:56:08,940
supposed to tell us
 

4411
01:56:08,940 --> 01:56:11,030
supposed to tell us
so there's a star in the Sun at the

4412
01:56:11,030 --> 01:56:11,040
so there's a star in the Sun at the
 

4413
01:56:11,040 --> 01:56:12,530
so there's a star in the Sun at the
bridge

4414
01:56:12,530 --> 01:56:12,540
bridge
 

4415
01:56:12,540 --> 01:56:13,310
bridge
yeah

4416
01:56:13,310 --> 01:56:13,320
yeah
 

4417
01:56:13,320 --> 01:56:16,729
yeah
does that mean that in this pattern we

4418
01:56:16,729 --> 01:56:16,739
does that mean that in this pattern we
 

4419
01:56:16,739 --> 01:56:17,990
does that mean that in this pattern we
want

4420
01:56:17,990 --> 01:56:18,000
want
 

4421
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,089
want
um the sun into the star also at the

4422
01:56:20,089 --> 01:56:20,099
um the sun into the star also at the
 

4423
01:56:20,099 --> 01:56:21,830
um the sun into the star also at the
bottom

4424
01:56:21,830 --> 01:56:21,840
bottom
 

4425
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:24,589
bottom
uh actually I don't know yeah the bridge

4426
01:56:24,589 --> 01:56:24,599
uh actually I don't know yeah the bridge
 

4427
01:56:24,599 --> 01:56:26,209
uh actually I don't know yeah the bridge
starts off with the star and because the

4428
01:56:26,209 --> 01:56:26,219
starts off with the star and because the
 

4429
01:56:26,219 --> 01:56:28,070
starts off with the star and because the
comet is on the other side I'm assuming

4430
01:56:28,070 --> 01:56:28,080
comet is on the other side I'm assuming
 

4431
01:56:28,080 --> 01:56:30,530
comet is on the other side I'm assuming
that's what's on the other side I don't

4432
01:56:30,530 --> 01:56:30,540
that's what's on the other side I don't
 

4433
01:56:30,540 --> 01:56:31,910
that's what's on the other side I don't
know what was on there I decided did you

4434
01:56:31,910 --> 01:56:31,920
know what was on there I decided did you
 

4435
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:33,830
know what was on there I decided did you
see that from there no no I'm just

4436
01:56:33,830 --> 01:56:33,840
see that from there no no I'm just
 

4437
01:56:33,840 --> 01:56:35,209
see that from there no no I'm just
assuming that that's what's on the other

4438
01:56:35,209 --> 01:56:35,219
assuming that that's what's on the other
 

4439
01:56:35,219 --> 01:56:37,850
assuming that that's what's on the other
side because I feel a little diagram

4440
01:56:37,850 --> 01:56:37,860
side because I feel a little diagram
 

4441
01:56:37,860 --> 01:56:39,470
side because I feel a little diagram
like uh

4442
01:56:39,470 --> 01:56:39,480
like uh
 

4443
01:56:39,480 --> 01:56:42,370

the comment starts in this position

4444
01:56:42,370 --> 01:56:42,380
the comment starts in this position
 

4445
01:56:42,380 --> 01:56:45,709
the comment starts in this position
oh and there's a gap in between the star

4446
01:56:45,709 --> 01:56:45,719
oh and there's a gap in between the star
 

4447
01:56:45,719 --> 01:56:47,270
oh and there's a gap in between the star
and the comments I was just assuming but

4448
01:56:47,270 --> 01:56:47,280
and the comments I was just assuming but
 

4449
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:50,870
and the comments I was just assuming but
I don't know

4450
01:56:50,870 --> 01:56:50,880

 

4451
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:54,470

well we can I guess we should try to

4452
01:56:54,470 --> 01:56:54,480
well we can I guess we should try to
 

4453
01:56:54,480 --> 01:56:57,530
well we can I guess we should try to
start by trying to get the star and the

4454
01:56:57,530 --> 01:56:57,540
start by trying to get the star and the
 

4455
01:56:57,540 --> 01:56:59,629
start by trying to get the star and the
sun in the red position

4456
01:56:59,629 --> 01:56:59,639
sun in the red position
 

4457
01:56:59,639 --> 01:57:03,169
sun in the red position
right

4458
01:57:03,169 --> 01:57:03,179

 

4459
01:57:03,179 --> 01:57:05,330

uh

4460
01:57:05,330 --> 01:57:05,340
uh
 

4461
01:57:05,340 --> 01:57:07,310
uh
this is the only thing that the lever

4462
01:57:07,310 --> 01:57:07,320
this is the only thing that the lever
 

4463
01:57:07,320 --> 01:57:11,450
this is the only thing that the lever
does resetting the this thing here

4464
01:57:11,450 --> 01:57:11,460
does resetting the this thing here
 

4465
01:57:11,460 --> 01:57:12,709
does resetting the this thing here
probably

4466
01:57:12,709 --> 01:57:12,719
probably
 

4467
01:57:12,719 --> 01:57:15,229
probably
to play I recently did something like

4468
01:57:15,229 --> 01:57:15,239
to play I recently did something like
 

4469
01:57:15,239 --> 01:57:17,030
to play I recently did something like
that so we know the one that works the

4470
01:57:17,030 --> 01:57:17,040
that so we know the one that works the
 

4471
01:57:17,040 --> 01:57:20,030
that so we know the one that works the
moon comes up so it goes so I guess the

4472
01:57:20,030 --> 01:57:20,040
moon comes up so it goes so I guess the
 

4473
01:57:20,040 --> 01:57:21,350
moon comes up so it goes so I guess the
star and the sun are already in the

4474
01:57:21,350 --> 01:57:21,360
star and the sun are already in the
 

4475
01:57:21,360 --> 01:57:23,390
star and the sun are already in the
correct position so the moon has to be

4476
01:57:23,390 --> 01:57:23,400
correct position so the moon has to be
 

4477
01:57:23,400 --> 01:57:26,510
correct position so the moon has to be
moved into a different position oh are

4478
01:57:26,510 --> 01:57:26,520
moved into a different position oh are
 

4479
01:57:26,520 --> 01:57:29,089
moved into a different position oh are
we just guessing then

4480
01:57:29,089 --> 01:57:29,099
we just guessing then
 

4481
01:57:29,099 --> 01:57:30,830
we just guessing then
well I mean it's not really guessing

4482
01:57:30,830 --> 01:57:30,840
well I mean it's not really guessing
 

4483
01:57:30,840 --> 01:57:31,910
well I mean it's not really guessing
because it's like a process of

4484
01:57:31,910 --> 01:57:31,920
because it's like a process of
 

4485
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:33,950
because it's like a process of
elimination if the star and the sun are

4486
01:57:33,950 --> 01:57:33,960
elimination if the star and the sun are
 

4487
01:57:33,960 --> 01:57:36,050
elimination if the star and the sun are
in the correct location

4488
01:57:36,050 --> 01:57:36,060
in the correct location
 

4489
01:57:36,060 --> 01:57:37,609
in the correct location
let me see if the sun disappears when

4490
01:57:37,609 --> 01:57:37,619
let me see if the sun disappears when
 

4491
01:57:37,619 --> 01:57:38,330
let me see if the sun disappears when
you move it

4492
01:57:38,330 --> 01:57:38,340
you move it
 

4493
01:57:38,340 --> 01:57:41,270

um
 

4505
01:57:54,840 --> 01:57:57,050
um
okay well the Moon is at the very top

4506
01:57:57,050 --> 01:57:57,060
okay well the Moon is at the very top
 

4507
01:57:57,060 --> 01:57:59,930
okay well the Moon is at the very top
now but like how do I know what else I

4508
01:57:59,930 --> 01:57:59,940
now but like how do I know what else I
 

4509
01:57:59,940 --> 01:58:01,430
now but like how do I know what else I
want there

4510
01:58:01,430 --> 01:58:01,440
want there
 

4511
01:58:01,440 --> 01:58:05,270

I know do you remember when I died where

01:58:07,440 --> 01:58:11,089
I know do you remember when I died where
you the moon was that time we

you the moon was that time we

01:58:22,920 --> 01:58:26,030
uh I just died again yeah
so whatever you did to the sun one uh

4528
01:58:26,030 --> 01:58:26,040
so whatever you did to the sun one uh
 

4529
01:58:26,040 --> 01:58:27,950
so whatever you did to the sun one uh
you just moved it and it yeah it killed

4530
01:58:27,950 --> 01:58:27,960
you just moved it and it yeah it killed
 

4531
01:58:27,960 --> 01:58:29,950
you just moved it and it yeah it killed
me how how

4532
01:58:29,950 --> 01:58:29,960
me how how
 

4533
01:58:29,960 --> 01:58:33,530
me how how
how is that possible how did they kill

4534
01:58:33,530 --> 01:58:33,540
how is that possible how did they kill
 

4535
01:58:33,540 --> 01:58:34,669

did you stand on the bridge yes
 

4539
01:58:38,219 --> 01:58:40,010
did you stand on the bridge yes
maybe I'm not just supposed to stand on

4540
01:58:40,010 --> 01:58:40,020
maybe I'm not just supposed to stand on
 

4541
01:58:40,020 --> 01:58:42,050
maybe I'm not just supposed to stand on
it I don't know let me see if it happens

4542
01:58:42,050 --> 01:58:42,060
it I don't know let me see if it happens
 

4543
01:58:42,060 --> 01:58:43,609
it I don't know let me see if it happens
again

4544
01:58:43,609 --> 01:58:43,619
again
 

4545
01:58:43,619 --> 01:58:48,910

4547
01:58:48,920 --> 01:58:52,550

okay uh yeah maybe it's supposed to be

4548
01:58:52,550 --> 01:58:52,560
okay uh yeah maybe it's supposed to be
 

4549
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:54,649
okay uh yeah maybe it's supposed to be
we can stand on the star one because

4550
01:58:54,649 --> 01:58:54,659
we can stand on the star one because
 

4551
01:58:54,659 --> 01:58:56,570
we can stand on the star one because
it's connected to two sides and the sun

4552
01:58:56,570 --> 01:58:56,580
it's connected to two sides and the sun
 

4553
01:58:56,580 --> 01:58:58,430
it's connected to two sides and the sun
one is only connected on one side so it

4554
01:58:58,430 --> 01:58:58,440
one is only connected on one side so it
 

4555
01:58:58,440 --> 01:59:05,510
one is only connected on one side so it
just Falls

4559
01:59:09,500 --> 01:59:13,129

ah wait maybe while you're moving that

4560
01:59:13,129 --> 01:59:13,139
ah wait maybe while you're moving that
 

4561
01:59:13,139 --> 01:59:15,290
ah wait maybe while you're moving that
if you move the right one in the right

4562
01:59:15,290 --> 01:59:15,300
if you move the right one in the right
 

4563
01:59:15,300 --> 01:59:17,510
if you move the right one in the right
position it would be connecting itself

4564
01:59:17,510 --> 01:59:17,520
position it would be connecting itself
 

4565
01:59:17,520 --> 01:59:20,689
position it would be connecting itself
to the star bridge to the sun Bridge

4566
01:59:20,689 --> 01:59:20,699
to the star bridge to the sun Bridge
 

4567
01:59:20,699 --> 01:59:23,030
to the star bridge to the sun Bridge
piece and I would see it here

4568
01:59:23,030 --> 01:59:23,040
piece and I would see it here
 

4569
01:59:23,040 --> 01:59:25,850
piece and I would see it here
yeah yeah okay I'll move uh I'll move

4570
01:59:25,850 --> 01:59:25,860
yeah yeah okay I'll move uh I'll move
 

4571
01:59:25,860 --> 01:59:28,070
yeah yeah okay I'll move uh I'll move
some around okay

4572
01:59:28,070 --> 01:59:28,080
some around okay
 

4573
01:59:28,080 --> 01:59:29,390
some around okay
um I might be very wrong with that

4574
01:59:29,390 --> 01:59:29,400
um I might be very wrong with that
 

4575
01:59:29,400 --> 01:59:31,089
um I might be very wrong with that
assumption though

4576
01:59:31,089 --> 01:59:31,099
assumption though
 

4577
01:59:31,099 --> 01:59:33,890
assumption though
we were dead together that's it can I

4578
01:59:33,890 --> 01:59:33,900
we were dead together that's it can I
 

4579
01:59:33,900 --> 01:59:34,910
we were dead together that's it can I
jump down here

4580
01:59:34,910 --> 01:59:34,920
jump down here
 

4581
01:59:34,920 --> 01:59:38,089
jump down here
oh my God again scary

4609
02:00:18,480 --> 02:00:19,910

but that would mean that the star is in

but that would mean that the star is in
 

4611
02:00:19,920 --> 02:00:23,689
but that would mean that the star is in
the right position but the sun is not

4613
02:00:23,699 --> 02:00:25,430

you you already understood that and I

02:00:31,020 --> 02:00:31,910
you you already understood that and I
just didn't understand that you

just didn't understand that you

understood it
 

4625
02:00:33,900 --> 02:00:37,070
understood it
but like see when we stand on the maybe

4626
02:00:37,070 --> 02:00:37,080
but like see when we stand on the maybe
 

4627
02:00:37,080 --> 02:00:39,770
but like see when we stand on the maybe
it's not about connecting not not about

4628
02:00:39,770 --> 02:00:39,780
it's not about connecting not not about
 

4629
02:00:39,780 --> 02:00:41,209
it's not about connecting not not about
the fact that the star was connected

4630
02:00:41,209 --> 02:00:41,219
the fact that the star was connected
 

4631
02:00:41,219 --> 02:00:44,089
the fact that the star was connected
with the sun and that's why it's uh

4632
02:00:44,089 --> 02:00:44,099
with the sun and that's why it's uh
 

4633
02:00:44,099 --> 02:00:46,850
with the sun and that's why it's uh
not falling down but like maybe the star

4634
02:00:46,850 --> 02:00:46,860
not falling down but like maybe the star
 

4635
02:00:46,860 --> 02:00:48,709
not falling down but like maybe the star
is in the right position currently and

4636
02:00:48,709 --> 02:00:48,719
is in the right position currently and
 

4637
02:00:48,719 --> 02:00:50,089
is in the right position currently and
that's why it's not falling down and the

4638
02:00:50,089 --> 02:00:50,099
that's why it's not falling down and the
 

4639
02:00:50,099 --> 02:00:52,550
that's why it's not falling down and the
Sun the bridge part does not fall down

4640
02:00:52,550 --> 02:00:52,560
Sun the bridge part does not fall down
 

4641
02:00:52,560 --> 02:00:54,410
Sun the bridge part does not fall down
because the sun peace is not in the

4642
02:00:54,410 --> 02:00:54,420
because the sun peace is not in the
 

4643
02:00:54,420 --> 02:00:56,209
because the sun peace is not in the
right position that's what I thought

4644
02:00:56,209 --> 02:00:56,219
right position that's what I thought
 

4645
02:00:56,219 --> 02:00:58,609
right position that's what I thought
first too but doesn't see why it would

4646
02:00:58,609 --> 02:00:58,619
first too but doesn't see why it would
 

4647
02:00:58,619 --> 02:01:03,770
first too but doesn't see why it would
appear I know why it would appear if uh

4648
02:01:03,770 --> 02:01:03,780

 

4649
02:01:03,780 --> 02:01:06,770

I don't know if you if you can you move

4650
02:01:06,770 --> 02:01:06,780
I don't know if you if you can you move
 

4651
02:01:06,780 --> 02:01:08,450
I don't know if you if you can you move
the star thing it doesn't do anything

4652
02:01:08,450 --> 02:01:08,460
the star thing it doesn't do anything
 

4653
02:01:08,460 --> 02:01:11,270
the star thing it doesn't do anything
huh when it moves I can still stand on

4654
02:01:11,270 --> 02:01:11,280
huh when it moves I can still stand on
 

4655
02:01:11,280 --> 02:01:14,750
huh when it moves I can still stand on
the bridge I guess

4656
02:01:14,750 --> 02:01:14,760

 

4657
02:01:14,760 --> 02:01:17,270

I'm moving a bunch of stuff around oh

4658
02:01:17,270 --> 02:01:17,280
I'm moving a bunch of stuff around oh
 

4659
02:01:17,280 --> 02:01:18,950
I'm moving a bunch of stuff around oh
wait the star couldn't be moved right I

4660
02:01:18,950 --> 02:01:18,960
wait the star couldn't be moved right I
 

4661
02:01:18,960 --> 02:01:20,330
wait the star couldn't be moved right I
feel like I tried to move oh is that the

4662
02:01:20,330 --> 02:01:20,340
feel like I tried to move oh is that the
 

4663
02:01:20,340 --> 02:01:22,310
feel like I tried to move oh is that the
sun if you look I tried moving the one

4664
02:01:22,310 --> 02:01:22,320
sun if you look I tried moving the one
 

4665
02:01:22,320 --> 02:01:24,649
sun if you look I tried moving the one
of them and it wasn't able to move

4666
02:01:24,649 --> 02:01:24,659
of them and it wasn't able to move
 

4667
02:01:24,659 --> 02:01:28,370
of them and it wasn't able to move
ah that one was locked right that's why

4668
02:01:28,370 --> 02:01:28,380
ah that one was locked right that's why
 

4669
02:01:28,380 --> 02:01:30,589
ah that one was locked right that's why
yeah this one always stays in place

4670
02:01:30,589 --> 02:01:30,599
yeah this one always stays in place
 

4671
02:01:30,599 --> 02:01:32,629
yeah this one always stays in place
no no changes

4672
02:01:32,629 --> 02:01:32,639
no no changes
 

4673
02:01:32,639 --> 02:01:36,470
no no changes
um okay I'll move the star

4674
02:01:36,470 --> 02:01:36,480

 

4675
02:01:36,480 --> 02:01:40,430

is that one not locked

4676
02:01:40,430 --> 02:01:40,440

 

4677
02:01:40,440 --> 02:01:43,490

oh it was locked in place

4678
02:01:43,490 --> 02:01:43,500
oh it was locked in place
 

4679
02:01:43,500 --> 02:01:46,370
oh it was locked in place
the star is is locked in place no okay

4680
02:01:46,370 --> 02:01:46,380
the star is is locked in place no okay
 

4681
02:01:46,380 --> 02:01:50,990
the star is is locked in place no okay
yeah it is that's okay that's why that

4682
02:01:50,990 --> 02:01:51,000
yeah it is that's okay that's why that
 

4683
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,149
yeah it is that's okay that's why that
one will never fall down the first piece

4684
02:01:53,149 --> 02:01:53,159
one will never fall down the first piece
 

4685
02:01:53,159 --> 02:01:55,250
one will never fall down the first piece
of the bridge so the star is already in

4686
02:01:55,250 --> 02:01:55,260
of the bridge so the star is already in
 

4687
02:01:55,260 --> 02:01:59,089
of the bridge so the star is already in
the right position perhaps

4688
02:01:59,089 --> 02:01:59,099
the right position perhaps
 

4689
02:01:59,099 --> 02:02:04,129
the right position perhaps
yeah okay yeah maybe maybe that's how it

4690
02:02:04,129 --> 02:02:04,139
yeah okay yeah maybe maybe that's how it
 

4691
02:02:04,139 --> 02:02:07,550
yeah okay yeah maybe maybe that's how it
works could be could be wrong but but

4692
02:02:07,550 --> 02:02:07,560
works could be could be wrong but but
 

4693
02:02:07,560 --> 02:02:08,750
works could be could be wrong but but
yeah

4694
02:02:08,750 --> 02:02:08,760
yeah
 

4695
02:02:08,760 --> 02:02:10,490
yeah
so

4696
02:02:10,490 --> 02:02:10,500
so
 

4697
02:02:10,500 --> 02:02:12,609
so
so

4698
02:02:12,609 --> 02:02:12,619
so
 

4699
02:02:12,619 --> 02:02:16,250
so
the sun would have to be

4700
02:02:16,250 --> 02:02:16,260
the sun would have to be
 

4701
02:02:16,260 --> 02:02:18,410
the sun would have to be
moved into every single position and we

4702
02:02:18,410 --> 02:02:18,420
moved into every single position and we
 

4703
02:02:18,420 --> 02:02:22,370
moved into every single position and we
will find out which one is the right one

4704
02:02:22,370 --> 02:02:22,380

 

4705
02:02:22,380 --> 02:02:24,950

uh and for each

4706
02:02:24,950 --> 02:02:24,960
uh and for each
 

4707
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:27,470
uh and for each
position you put it in I have to try to

4708
02:02:27,470 --> 02:02:27,480
position you put it in I have to try to
 

4709
02:02:27,480 --> 02:02:29,870
position you put it in I have to try to
stand on it to test it out

4710
02:02:29,870 --> 02:02:29,880
stand on it to test it out
 

4711
02:02:29,880 --> 02:02:32,570
stand on it to test it out
okay okay then let's try every single

4712
02:02:32,570 --> 02:02:32,580
okay okay then let's try every single
 

4713
02:02:32,580 --> 02:02:34,189
okay okay then let's try every single
position once you change it I'll stand

4714
02:02:34,189 --> 02:02:34,199
position once you change it I'll stand
 

4715
02:02:34,199 --> 02:02:38,330
position once you change it I'll stand
on it let me know all right I changed it

4716
02:02:38,330 --> 02:02:38,340
on it let me know all right I changed it
 

4717
02:02:38,340 --> 02:02:41,570
on it let me know all right I changed it
that was incorrect

4718
02:02:41,570 --> 02:02:41,580
that was incorrect
 

4719
02:02:41,580 --> 02:02:43,910
that was incorrect
next position please

4720
02:02:43,910 --> 02:02:43,920
next position please
 

4721
02:02:43,920 --> 02:02:46,250
next position please
okay

4722
02:02:46,250 --> 02:02:46,260
okay
 

4723
02:02:46,260 --> 02:02:48,950
okay
all right I changed it okay

4724
02:02:48,950 --> 02:02:48,960
all right I changed it okay
 

4725
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:51,530
all right I changed it okay
that was that was correct and I see the

4726
02:02:51,530 --> 02:02:51,540
that was that was correct and I see the
 

4727
02:02:51,540 --> 02:02:54,290
that was that was correct and I see the
moon now we have to change the Moon but

4728
02:02:54,290 --> 02:02:54,300
moon now we have to change the Moon but
 

4729
02:02:54,300 --> 02:02:56,089
moon now we have to change the Moon but
in order to change the movie maybe maybe

4730
02:02:56,089 --> 02:02:56,099
in order to change the movie maybe maybe
 

4731
02:02:56,099 --> 02:02:58,010
in order to change the movie maybe maybe

4732
02:02:58,010 --> 02:02:58,020
have to change the sun again just keep
 

4733

okay okay
uh the moon only showed up as it was the

4742
02:03:10,550 --> 02:03:10,560
uh the moon only showed up as it was the
 

4743
02:03:10,560 --> 02:03:12,530
uh the moon only showed up as it was the
sun because the sun was already correct

4744
02:03:12,530 --> 02:03:12,540
sun because the sun was already correct
 

4745
02:03:12,540 --> 02:03:14,810
sun because the sun was already correct
okay so now I know that I should not

4746
02:03:14,810 --> 02:03:14,820
okay so now I know that I should not
 

4747
02:03:14,820 --> 02:03:16,729
okay so now I know that I should not
stand on that way it doesn't connect uh

4748
02:03:16,729 --> 02:03:16,739
stand on that way it doesn't connect uh
 

4749
02:03:16,739 --> 02:03:18,589
stand on that way it doesn't connect uh
it's currently not connected

4750
02:03:18,589 --> 02:03:18,599
it's currently not connected
 

4751
02:03:18,599 --> 02:03:22,129
it's currently not connected
um yeah uh the sound okay so uh the line

4752
02:03:22,129 --> 02:03:22,139
um yeah uh the sound okay so uh the line
 

4753
02:03:22,139 --> 02:03:25,070
um yeah uh the sound okay so uh the line
appears when the sun is next to the moon

4754
02:03:25,070 --> 02:03:25,080
appears when the sun is next to the moon
 

4755
02:03:25,080 --> 02:03:26,570
appears when the sun is next to the moon
but when I move the moon to a different

4756
02:03:26,570 --> 02:03:26,580
but when I move the moon to a different
 

4757
02:03:26,580 --> 02:03:28,430
but when I move the moon to a different
spot there's no line so maybe just

4758
02:03:28,430 --> 02:03:28,440
spot there's no line so maybe just
 

4759
02:03:28,440 --> 02:03:30,169
spot there's no line so maybe just
something else has to be on the other

4760
02:03:30,169 --> 02:03:30,179
something else has to be on the other
 

4761
02:03:30,179 --> 02:03:33,950
something else has to be on the other
side of the moon

4762
02:03:33,950 --> 02:03:33,960

 

4763
02:03:33,960 --> 02:03:35,290

sentence but what I know is that
 

4769
02:03:40,739 --> 02:03:42,890
sentence but what I know is that
um the moon piece is currently not

4770
02:03:42,890 --> 02:03:42,900
um the moon piece is currently not
 

4771
02:03:42,900 --> 02:03:45,290
um the moon piece is currently not
showing up because it only shows up uh

4772

showing up because it only shows up uh
 

4773
02:03:45,300 --> 02:03:47,450
showing up because it only shows up uh
if the sound piece is in the right right

if the sound piece is in the right right
 

4775
02:03:47,460 --> 02:03:50,330
if the sound piece is in the right right
position so currently I have two pieces

and the moon piece is in front of me but
 

4831
02:04:59,280 --> 02:05:01,310
and the moon piece is in front of me but
once I get to and walk off of the sound

4832
02:05:01,310 --> 02:05:01,320
once I get to and walk off of the sound
 

4833

4836
02:05:07,010 --> 02:05:07,020
I guess I'm like locking it while I'm
 

4837
02:05:07,020 --> 02:05:09,830

standing on it yeah yeah so when you

4838
02:05:09,830 --> 02:05:09,840
standing on it yeah yeah so when you
 

4839
02:05:09,840 --> 02:05:11,629
standing on it yeah yeah so when you
stand on it there's there's a line

4840
02:05:11,629 --> 02:05:11,639
stand on it there's there's a line
 

4841
02:05:11,639 --> 02:05:14,390
stand on it there's there's a line
appearing between the star the sun and

4842
02:05:14,390 --> 02:05:14,400
appearing between the star the sun and
 

4843
02:05:14,400 --> 02:05:16,010
appearing between the star the sun and
the moon right now

4844
02:05:16,010 --> 02:05:16,020
the moon right now
 

4845
02:05:16,020 --> 02:05:19,430
the moon right now
but maybe if I get the right well then I

4846
02:05:19,430 --> 02:05:19,440
but maybe if I get the right well then I
 

4847
02:05:19,440 --> 02:05:21,470
but maybe if I get the right well then I
gotta lock the moon into place I think

4848
02:05:21,470 --> 02:05:21,480
gotta lock the moon into place I think
 

4849
02:05:21,480 --> 02:05:23,569

upstairs

5176
02:13:00,890 --> 02:13:00,900
upstairs
 

5177
02:13:00,900 --> 02:13:03,109
upstairs
so when I go up the left side it is

5178
02:13:03,109 --> 02:13:03,119
so when I go up the left side it is
 

5179
02:13:03,119 --> 02:13:06,370
so when I go up the left side it is
connected to the swirly Whirly

5180
02:13:06,370 --> 02:13:06,380
connected to the swirly Whirly
 

5181
02:13:06,380 --> 02:13:10,010
connected to the swirly Whirly
and if I go to the right side it is

5182
02:13:10,010 --> 02:13:10,020
and if I go to the right side it is
 

5183
02:13:10,020 --> 02:13:12,229
and if I go to the right side it is
currently connected but not locked in

5184
02:13:12,229 --> 02:13:12,239
currently connected but not locked in
 

5185
02:13:12,239 --> 02:13:15,350
currently connected but not locked in
with the comet so I would reckon that

5186
02:13:15,350 --> 02:13:15,360
with the comet so I would reckon that
 

5187
02:13:15,360 --> 02:13:16,790
with the comet so I would reckon that
the swirly whirly is in the correct

5188
02:13:16,790 --> 02:13:16,800
the swirly whirly is in the correct
 

5189
02:13:16,800 --> 02:13:20,030
the swirly whirly is in the correct
position but the combat is not yeah I

5190
02:13:20,030 --> 02:13:20,040
position but the combat is not yeah I

um one of them has a bunch of numbers

5718
02:26:03,469 --> 02:26:03,479
um one of them has a bunch of numbers
 

5719
02:26:03,479 --> 02:26:05,630
um one of them has a bunch of numbers
five numbers and the other one has the

5720
02:26:05,630 --> 02:26:05,640
five numbers and the other one has the
 

5721
02:26:05,640 --> 02:26:07,070
five numbers and the other one has the
other five numbers so on the right side

5722
02:26:07,070 --> 02:26:07,080
other five numbers so on the right side
 

5723
02:26:07,080 --> 02:26:08,570
other five numbers so on the right side
I have for example one but on the other

5724
02:26:08,570 --> 02:26:08,580
I have for example one but on the other
 

5725
02:26:08,580 --> 02:26:10,370
I have for example one but on the other
post I don't have one so we gotta

5726
02:26:10,370 --> 02:26:10,380
post I don't have one so we gotta
 

5727
02:26:10,380 --> 02:26:12,590
post I don't have one so we gotta
probably start with one and that one is

5728
02:26:12,590 --> 02:26:12,600
probably start with one and that one is
 

5729
02:26:12,600 --> 02:26:16,130
probably start with one and that one is
attached to D2 so on my finger here I

5730
02:26:16,130 --> 02:26:16,140
attached to D2 so on my finger here I
 

5731
02:26:16,140 --> 02:26:18,650
attached to D2 so on my finger here I
think I first have to do a D2

5732
02:26:18,650 --> 02:26:18,660
think I first have to do a D2
 

5733
02:26:18,660 --> 02:26:20,929
think I first have to do a D2
um I have to pick Point like one of the

5734
02:26:20,929 --> 02:26:20,939
um I have to pick Point like one of the
 

5735
02:26:20,939 --> 02:26:23,210
um I have to pick Point like one of the
elements on my monitor screen thingy on

5736
02:26:23,210 --> 02:26:23,220
elements on my monitor screen thingy on
 

5737

that was what that was briefly I did

5782
02:27:31,849 --> 02:27:31,859
that was what that was briefly I did
 

5783
02:27:31,859 --> 02:27:33,469
that was what that was briefly I did
what

5784
02:27:33,469 --> 02:27:33,479
what
 

5785
02:27:33,479 --> 02:27:36,530
what
oh do you have any any idea what the

5786
02:27:36,530 --> 02:27:36,540
oh do you have any any idea what the
 

5787
02:27:36,540 --> 02:27:38,990
oh do you have any any idea what the
stuff over at your place does

5788
02:27:38,990 --> 02:27:39,000
stuff over at your place does
 

5789
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,030
stuff over at your place does
uh yeah so the only thing I could do is

5790
02:27:41,030 --> 02:27:41,040
uh yeah so the only thing I could do is
 

5791
02:27:41,040 --> 02:27:43,130
uh yeah so the only thing I could do is
connect between the grid that I have

5792
02:27:43,130 --> 02:27:43,140
connect between the grid that I have
 

5793
02:27:43,140 --> 02:27:45,830
connect between the grid that I have
with all the elements on it and then I

5794
02:27:45,830 --> 02:27:45,840
with all the elements on it and then I
 

5795
02:27:45,840 --> 02:27:47,570
with all the elements on it and then I
can't interact with them but there's

5796
02:27:47,570 --> 02:27:47,580
can't interact with them but there's
 

5797
02:27:47,580 --> 02:27:51,770
can't interact with them but there's
glowing circles and arrows which uh one

5798
02:27:51,770 --> 02:27:51,780
glowing circles and arrows which uh one
 

5799
02:27:51,780 --> 02:27:53,570
glowing circles and arrows which uh one
circle is like circled around a book and

5800
02:27:53,570 --> 02:27:53,580
circle is like circled around a book and
 

5801
02:27:53,580 --> 02:27:55,190
circle is like circled around a book and
then pointing to another book that's

5802
02:27:55,190 --> 02:27:55,200
then pointing to another book that's
 

5803
02:27:55,200 --> 02:27:58,070
then pointing to another book that's
circled with a glowing or uh Arrow so

5804
02:27:58,070 --> 02:27:58,080
circled with a glowing or uh Arrow so
 

5805
02:27:58,080 --> 02:28:00,050
circled with a glowing or uh Arrow so
each book has different numbers on it so

5806
02:28:00,050 --> 02:28:00,060
each book has different numbers on it so
 

5807
02:28:00,060 --> 02:28:04,210
each book has different numbers on it so
one is like four to nine uh five to one

5808
02:28:04,210 --> 02:28:04,220
one is like four to nine uh five to one
 

5809
02:28:04,220 --> 02:28:08,330
one is like four to nine uh five to one
three two two ten oh maybe it's a code

5810
02:28:08,330 --> 02:28:08,340
three two two ten oh maybe it's a code
 

5811
02:28:08,340 --> 02:28:11,330
three two two ten oh maybe it's a code
maybe like the it's opposite so like if

5812
02:28:11,330 --> 02:28:11,340
maybe like the it's opposite so like if
 

5813
02:28:11,340 --> 02:28:15,770
maybe like the it's opposite so like if
if on your thing it says like a A5 or

5814
02:28:15,770 --> 02:28:15,780
if on your thing it says like a A5 or
 

5815
02:28:15,780 --> 02:28:18,370
if on your thing it says like a A5 or
something it's actually A1

5816
02:28:18,370 --> 02:28:18,380
something it's actually A1
 

5817
02:28:18,380 --> 02:28:22,190
something it's actually A1
you mean for example if my if my number

5818
02:28:22,190 --> 02:28:22,200
you mean for example if my if my number
 

5819
02:28:22,200 --> 02:28:25,309
you mean for example if my if my number
one says D2

5820
02:28:25,309 --> 02:28:25,319
one says D2
 

5821
02:28:25,319 --> 02:28:28,130
one says D2
then on your book it says one is with

5822
02:28:28,130 --> 02:28:28,140
then on your book it says one is with
 

5823
02:28:28,140 --> 02:28:32,750
then on your book it says one is with
what number

5824
02:28:32,750 --> 02:28:32,760

 

5825
02:28:32,760 --> 02:28:36,290

I've five so that would mean that the

5826
02:28:36,290 --> 02:28:36,300
I've five so that would mean that the
 

5827
02:28:36,300 --> 02:28:38,750
I've five so that would mean that the
first one is not

5828
02:28:38,750 --> 02:28:38,760
first one is not
 

5829
02:28:38,760 --> 02:28:41,750
first one is not
day two but what it says here for five

5830
02:28:41,750 --> 02:28:41,760
day two but what it says here for five
 

5831
02:28:41,760 --> 02:28:43,110

uh which numbers I have a lot of numbers
 

5935
02:31:17,580 --> 02:31:22,570
uh which numbers I have a lot of numbers
uh for example one one is D2

okay so I guess if it's a code and the

5956
02:31:45,349 --> 02:31:45,359
okay so I guess if it's a code and the
 

5957
02:31:45,359 --> 02:31:47,929
okay so I guess if it's a code and the
arrows only go one way then if it's one

02:31:47,929 --> 02:31:47,939
arrows only go one way then if it's one
 

5959
02:31:47,939 --> 02:31:49,910
arrows only go one way then if it's one
then it stays one but if it's five then

5960
02:31:49,910 --> 02:31:49,920
then it stays one but if it's five then
 

5961
02:31:49,920 --> 02:31:52,969
then it stays one but if it's five then
it becomes one

5963
02:31:52,979 --> 02:31:56,330

can you repeat that over uh because the

5964
02:31:56,330 --> 02:31:56,340
can you repeat that over uh because the
 

5965
02:31:56,340 --> 02:31:57,530
can you repeat that over uh because the
arrows are pointing in One Direction

5966
02:31:57,530 --> 02:31:57,540
arrows are pointing in One Direction
 

5967
02:31:57,540 --> 02:32:01,309
arrows are pointing in One Direction
then maybe the oh the numbers which

5968
02:32:01,309 --> 02:32:01,319
then maybe the oh the numbers which
 

5969
02:32:01,319 --> 02:32:03,469
then maybe the oh the numbers which
um or at the start of the arrow so if

5970
02:32:03,469 --> 02:32:03,479
um or at the start of the arrow so if
 

5971
02:32:03,479 --> 02:32:05,990
um or at the start of the arrow so if
it's 10 it becomes eight but if it's

5972
02:32:05,990 --> 02:32:06,000
it's 10 it becomes eight but if it's
 

5973
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,030
it's 10 it becomes eight but if it's
eight it doesn't become 10. you know

5974
02:32:08,030 --> 02:32:08,040
eight it doesn't become 10. you know
 

5975
02:32:08,040 --> 02:32:10,750
eight it doesn't become 10. you know
what I mean it just stays that number

5976
02:32:10,750 --> 02:32:10,760
what I mean it just stays that number
 

5977
02:32:10,760 --> 02:32:15,790

ten to eight now I don't know if this is

6430
02:44:03,290 --> 02:44:03,300
ten to eight now I don't know if this is
 

6431
02:44:03,300 --> 02:44:06,590
ten to eight now I don't know if this is
seven to six or nine to sit uh sorry I

don't know if this is nine to seven or
 

6435
02:44:07,859 --> 02:44:09,650
don't know if this is nine to seven or
six to seven so I guess we'll try let's

6436
02:44:09,650 --> 02:44:09,660
six to seven so I guess we'll try let's
 

6437
02:44:09,660 --> 02:44:13,450
six to seven so I guess we'll try let's
do uh nine to seven first

6438
02:44:13,450 --> 02:44:13,460
do uh nine to seven first
 

6439
02:44:13,460 --> 02:44:21,830
do uh nine to seven first
uh A4 to E2

6440
02:44:21,830 --> 02:44:21,840

 

6441
02:44:21,840 --> 02:44:23,990

okay that's probably not it let's try it

6442
02:44:23,990 --> 02:44:24,000
okay that's probably not it let's try it
 

6443
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:28,929
okay that's probably not it let's try it
okay let's try six two uh seven

6444
02:44:28,929 --> 02:44:28,939
okay let's try six two uh seven
 

6445
02:44:28,939 --> 02:44:32,090
okay let's try six two uh seven
before to

6446
02:44:32,090 --> 02:44:32,100
before to
 

6447
02:44:32,100 --> 02:44:37,070
before to
eat

6448
02:44:37,070 --> 02:44:37,080

 

6449
02:44:37,080 --> 02:44:39,950

ah so those two have to be blue is that

6450
02:44:39,950 --> 02:44:39,960
ah so those two have to be blue is that
 

6451
02:44:39,960 --> 02:44:41,809
ah so those two have to be blue is that
it because that was blue now I always

6452
02:44:41,809 --> 02:44:41,819
it because that was blue now I always
 

6453
02:44:41,819 --> 02:44:44,510
it because that was blue now I always
have to be right four to six or four to

6454
02:44:44,510 --> 02:44:44,520
have to be right four to six or four to
 

6455
02:44:44,520 --> 02:44:46,269
have to be right four to six or four to
nine I guess

6456
02:44:46,269 --> 02:44:46,279
nine I guess
 

6457
02:44:46,279 --> 02:44:51,830
nine I guess
uh four maybe five two

6458
02:44:51,830 --> 02:44:51,840
uh four maybe five two
 

6459
02:44:51,840 --> 02:44:57,290
uh four maybe five two
A5 e e five to a four E5 to A4

6460
02:44:57,290 --> 02:44:57,300
A5 e e five to a four E5 to A4
 

6461
02:44:57,300 --> 02:45:00,170
A5 e e five to a four E5 to A4
okay so uh both those last two I just

6462
02:45:00,170 --> 02:45:00,180
okay so uh both those last two I just
 

6463
02:45:00,180 --> 02:45:02,809
okay so uh both those last two I just
did are blue which means yeah that the

6464
02:45:02,809 --> 02:45:02,819
did are blue which means yeah that the
 

6465
02:45:02,819 --> 02:45:05,090
did are blue which means yeah that the
elements are correct so I guess for the

6466
02:45:05,090 --> 02:45:05,100
elements are correct so I guess for the
 

6467
02:45:05,100 --> 02:45:07,610
elements are correct so I guess for the
other three uh they should be different

6468
02:45:07,610 --> 02:45:07,620
other three uh they should be different
 

6469
02:45:07,620 --> 02:45:09,830
other three uh they should be different
elements

6470
02:45:09,830 --> 02:45:09,840
elements
 

6471
02:45:09,840 --> 02:45:15,429
elements
foreign

6472
02:45:15,429 --> 02:45:15,439

 

6473
02:45:15,439 --> 02:45:17,690

is it perhaps

6474
02:45:17,690 --> 02:45:17,700
is it perhaps
 

6475
02:45:17,700 --> 02:45:20,150
is it perhaps
because that one is set in stone and

6476
02:45:20,150 --> 02:45:20,160
because that one is set in stone and
 

6477
02:45:20,160 --> 02:45:22,210
because that one is set in stone and
it's green

6478
02:45:22,210 --> 02:45:22,220
it's green
 

6479
02:45:22,220 --> 02:45:24,610
it's green
ah so it's opposite

6480
02:45:24,610 --> 02:45:24,620
ah so it's opposite
 

6481
02:45:24,620 --> 02:45:27,950
ah so it's opposite
I can put it back oh [\h__\h] whichever one

6482
02:45:27,950 --> 02:45:27,960
I can put it back oh [\h__\h] whichever one
 

6483
02:45:27,960 --> 02:45:31,550
I can put it back oh [\h__\h] whichever one
is red then put blue as opposite

6484
02:45:31,550 --> 02:45:31,560
is red then put blue as opposite
 

6485
02:45:31,560 --> 02:45:33,349
is red then put blue as opposite
so like for the fire one that's

6486
02:45:33,349 --> 02:45:33,359
so like for the fire one that's
 

6487
02:45:33,359 --> 02:45:34,730
so like for the fire one that's
connected to the lightning bolt just

6488
02:45:34,730 --> 02:45:34,740
connected to the lightning bolt just
 

6489
02:45:34,740 --> 02:45:37,790
connected to the lightning bolt just
turn the lightning bolt to Blue

6490
02:45:37,790 --> 02:45:37,800
turn the lightning bolt to Blue
 

6491
02:45:37,800 --> 02:45:41,630
turn the lightning bolt to Blue
okay can you connect it again

6492
02:45:41,630 --> 02:45:41,640

 

6493
02:45:41,640 --> 02:45:43,370

and can you connect the other one again

6494
02:45:43,370 --> 02:45:43,380
and can you connect the other one again
 

6495
02:45:43,380 --> 02:45:47,090
and can you connect the other one again
the uh bottom left to the middle red one

6496
02:45:47,090 --> 02:45:47,100
the uh bottom left to the middle red one
 

6497
02:45:47,100 --> 02:45:50,150
the uh bottom left to the middle red one
oh yeah I can't get it because the first

6498
02:45:50,150 --> 02:45:50,160
oh yeah I can't get it because the first
 

6499
02:45:50,160 --> 02:45:52,370
oh yeah I can't get it because the first
one started out as green and I the one

6500
02:45:52,370 --> 02:45:52,380
one started out as green and I the one
 

6501
02:45:52,380 --> 02:45:55,070
one started out as green and I the one
that I set uh I can change the colors

6502
02:45:55,070 --> 02:45:55,080
that I set uh I can change the colors
 

6503
02:45:55,080 --> 02:45:58,610
that I set uh I can change the colors
and that one has to be red okay so that

6504
02:45:58,610 --> 02:45:58,620
and that one has to be red okay so that
 

6505
02:45:58,620 --> 02:46:01,370
and that one has to be red okay so that
one started out as a Pikachu so the next

6506
02:46:01,370 --> 02:46:01,380
one started out as a Pikachu so the next
 

6507
02:46:01,380 --> 02:46:04,370
one started out as a Pikachu so the next
one has to be blue

6508
02:46:04,370 --> 02:46:04,380

God okay I I you know the problem was in

6516
02:46:14,809 --> 02:46:14,819
God okay I I you know the problem was in
 

6517
02:46:14,819 --> 02:46:16,490
God okay I I you know the problem was in
the beginning I thought that I already

6518
02:46:16,490 --> 02:46:16,500
the beginning I thought that I already
 

6519
02:46:16,500 --> 02:46:18,410
the beginning I thought that I already
had to figure out the elements from the

6520
02:46:18,410 --> 02:46:18,420
had to figure out the elements from the
 

6521
02:46:18,420 --> 02:46:20,510
had to figure out the elements from the
get-go but I could only figure it out

6522
02:46:20,510 --> 02:46:20,520
get-go but I could only figure it out
 

6523
02:46:20,520 --> 02:46:22,250
get-go but I could only figure it out
once the connections were made then it

6524
02:46:22,250 --> 02:46:22,260
once the connections were made then it
 

6525
02:46:22,260 --> 02:46:23,870
once the connections were made then it
was easy then it made sense but I tried

6526
02:46:23,870 --> 02:46:23,880
was easy then it made sense but I tried
 

6527
02:46:23,880 --> 02:46:26,990
was easy then it made sense but I tried
to figure it out too early yeah yeah oh

6528
02:46:26,990 --> 02:46:27,000
to figure it out too early yeah yeah oh
 

6529

oh my god
um well there the pattern is that

6826
02:52:57,230 --> 02:52:57,240
um well there the pattern is that
 

6827
02:52:57,240 --> 02:53:00,110
um well there the pattern is that
they're connected with wires at the top

6828
02:53:00,110 --> 02:53:00,120
they're connected with wires at the top
 

6829
02:53:00,120 --> 02:53:03,070
they're connected with wires at the top
and there's one two three

6830
02:53:03,070 --> 02:53:03,080
and there's one two three
 

6831

that time that's that has I guess
nothing to do with the with the fuse it

6886
02:54:17,510 --> 02:54:17,520
nothing to do with the with the fuse it
 

6887
02:54:17,520 --> 02:54:19,730
nothing to do with the with the fuse it
has to do with time okay [\h__\h] I'm about

6888
02:54:19,730 --> 02:54:19,740
has to do with time okay [\h__\h] I'm about
 

6889
02:54:19,740 --> 02:54:23,090
has to do with time okay [\h__\h] I'm about
to die probably yeah at least we figured

6890
02:54:23,090 --> 02:54:23,100
to die probably yeah at least we figured
 

6891
02:54:23,100 --> 02:54:25,210
to die probably yeah at least we figured
it out for the next time yeah yeah yeah

6892
02:54:25,210 --> 02:54:25,220
it out for the next time yeah yeah yeah
 

6893
02:54:25,220 --> 02:54:28,370
it out for the next time yeah yeah yeah
I just you know I never died before for

6894
02:54:28,370 --> 02:54:28,380
I just you know I never died before for
 

6895
02:54:28,380 --> 02:54:30,769
I just you know I never died before for
like electrocution as a Phoenix Sun so

6896
02:54:30,769 --> 02:54:30,779
like electrocution as a Phoenix Sun so
 

6897
02:54:30,779 --> 02:54:32,389
like electrocution as a Phoenix Sun so
this is gonna be new for me I don't know

6935
02:55:17,460 --> 02:55:19,790

so what have we learned

6936
02:55:19,790 --> 02:55:19,800
so what have we learned
 

6937
02:55:19,800 --> 02:55:22,130
so what have we learned
and I know lagging right now uh he's

6938
02:55:22,130 --> 02:55:22,140
and I know lagging right now uh he's
 

6939
02:55:22,140 --> 02:55:24,170
and I know lagging right now uh he's
loading the game okay we learned how to

6940
02:55:24,170 --> 02:55:24,180
loading the game okay we learned how to
 

6941
02:55:24,180 --> 02:55:25,450
loading the game okay we learned how to
connect them

6942
02:55:25,450 --> 02:55:25,460
connect them
 

6943
02:55:25,460 --> 02:55:27,650
connect them
are we sure about that though because I

6944
02:55:27,650 --> 02:55:27,660
are we sure about that though because I
 

6945
02:55:27,660 --> 02:55:32,090
are we sure about that though because I
had a lot of leftover fuses

6946
02:55:32,090 --> 02:55:32,100

 

6947
02:55:32,100 --> 02:55:33,830

I'll be fine I think it'll be like a

6948
02:55:33,830 --> 02:55:33,840
I'll be fine I think it'll be like a
 

6949
02:55:33,840 --> 02:55:35,870
I'll be fine I think it'll be like a
process of elimination thing

6950
02:55:35,870 --> 02:55:35,880
process of elimination thing
 

6951
02:55:35,880 --> 02:55:38,990
process of elimination thing
okay I'm in the water

6952
02:55:38,990 --> 02:55:39,000
okay I'm in the water
 

6953
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:42,769
okay I'm in the water
the timer is gone okay does this have

6954
02:55:42,769 --> 02:55:42,779
the timer is gone okay does this have
 

6955
02:55:42,779 --> 02:55:46,610
the timer is gone okay does this have
anything is it oh wait there's ah I

6956
02:55:46,610 --> 02:55:46,620
anything is it oh wait there's ah I
 

6957
02:55:46,620 --> 02:55:47,990
anything is it oh wait there's ah I
guess at the end I have to pull the

6958
02:55:47,990 --> 02:55:48,000
guess at the end I have to pull the
 

6959
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:50,090
guess at the end I have to pull the
lever here and then see if that lets me

6960
02:55:50,090 --> 02:55:50,100
lever here and then see if that lets me
 

6961
02:55:50,100 --> 02:55:51,889
lever here and then see if that lets me
out okay

6962
02:55:51,889 --> 02:55:51,899
out okay
 

6963
02:55:51,899 --> 02:55:53,809
out okay
um

6964
02:55:53,809 --> 02:55:53,819
um
 

6965
02:55:53,819 --> 02:55:55,790
um
okay well

6966
02:55:55,790 --> 02:55:55,800
okay well
 

6967
02:55:55,800 --> 02:55:57,349
okay well
there's no way that the first

6968
02:55:57,349 --> 02:55:57,359
there's no way that the first
 

6969
02:55:57,359 --> 02:55:58,910
there's no way that the first
combination that we tried is correct

6970
02:55:58,910 --> 02:55:58,920
combination that we tried is correct
 

6971
02:55:58,920 --> 02:56:00,290
combination that we tried is correct
though because you gave me a bunch of

6972
02:56:00,290 --> 02:56:00,300
though because you gave me a bunch of
 

6973
02:56:00,300 --> 02:56:02,510
though because you gave me a bunch of
different colors and

6974
02:56:02,510 --> 02:56:02,520
different colors and
 

6975
02:56:02,520 --> 02:56:04,429
different colors and
and yeah

6976
02:56:04,429 --> 02:56:04,439
and yeah
 

6977
02:56:04,439 --> 02:56:06,950
and yeah
I just picked a random one

6978
02:56:06,950 --> 02:56:06,960
I just picked a random one
 

6979
02:56:06,960 --> 02:56:11,630
I just picked a random one
uh well uh it sounded like only one

6980
02:56:11,630 --> 02:56:11,640
uh well uh it sounded like only one
 

6981
02:56:11,640 --> 02:56:13,429
uh well uh it sounded like only one
could fit in that particular like

6982
02:56:13,429 --> 02:56:13,439
could fit in that particular like
 

6983
02:56:13,439 --> 02:56:15,290
could fit in that particular like
whatever you're putting it into so

6984
02:56:15,290 --> 02:56:15,300
whatever you're putting it into so
 

6985
02:56:15,300 --> 02:56:16,969
whatever you're putting it into so
that's why I thought well if it can fit

6986
02:56:16,969 --> 02:56:16,979
that's why I thought well if it can fit
 

6987
02:56:16,979 --> 02:56:19,370
that's why I thought well if it can fit
then that must be it but I put a

6988
02:56:19,370 --> 02:56:19,380
then that must be it but I put a
 

6989
02:56:19,380 --> 02:56:20,769
then that must be it but I put a
different one in there now where

6990
02:56:20,769 --> 02:56:20,779
different one in there now where
 

6991
02:56:20,779 --> 02:56:23,090
different one in there now where
previously I put in green or something I

6992
02:56:23,090 --> 02:56:23,100
previously I put in green or something I
 

6993
02:56:23,100 --> 02:56:25,790
previously I put in green or something I
think I put in red now and it doesn't

6994
02:56:25,790 --> 02:56:25,800
think I put in red now and it doesn't
 

6995
02:56:25,800 --> 02:56:27,590
think I put in red now and it doesn't
there's no reaction

6996
02:56:27,590 --> 02:56:27,600
there's no reaction
 

6997
02:56:27,600 --> 02:56:29,750
there's no reaction
I guess as long as it maybe maybe

6998
02:56:29,750 --> 02:56:29,760
I guess as long as it maybe maybe
 

6999
02:56:29,760 --> 02:56:30,650
I guess as long as it maybe maybe
because

7000
02:56:30,650 --> 02:56:30,660
because
 

7001
02:56:30,660 --> 02:56:32,630
because
um it's about the way it connects like

7002
02:56:32,630 --> 02:56:32,640
um it's about the way it connects like
 

7003
02:56:32,640 --> 02:56:33,950
um it's about the way it connects like
I'm looking at a double blue one that

7004
02:56:33,950 --> 02:56:33,960
I'm looking at a double blue one that
 

7005
02:56:33,960 --> 02:56:35,450
I'm looking at a double blue one that
connects to a red one that connects to

7006
02:56:35,450 --> 02:56:35,460
connects to a red one that connects to
 

7007
02:56:35,460 --> 02:56:37,610
connects to a red one that connects to
like two different ones so maybe it has

7008
02:56:37,610 --> 02:56:37,620
like two different ones so maybe it has
 

7009
02:56:37,620 --> 02:56:39,849
like two different ones so maybe it has
to go via how it connects I don't know

7010
02:56:39,849 --> 02:56:39,859
to go via how it connects I don't know
 

7011
02:56:39,859 --> 02:56:42,769
to go via how it connects I don't know
ah wait a second

7012
02:56:42,769 --> 02:56:42,779
ah wait a second
 

7013
02:56:42,779 --> 02:56:44,510
ah wait a second
um maybe the correct one because it goes

7014
02:56:44,510 --> 02:56:44,520
um maybe the correct one because it goes
 

7015
02:56:44,520 --> 02:56:50,450
um maybe the correct one because it goes
green to Green

7016
02:56:50,450 --> 02:56:50,460

 

7017
02:56:50,460 --> 02:56:55,929

um but from the ones that I connected to

7018
02:56:55,929 --> 02:56:55,939

 

7019
02:56:55,939 --> 02:56:59,150

or a yellow green which ones were

7020
02:56:59,150 --> 02:56:59,160
or a yellow green which ones were
 

7021
02:56:59,160 --> 02:57:01,730
or a yellow green which ones were
connected to yellow green again a single

7022
02:57:01,730 --> 02:57:01,740
connected to yellow green again a single
 

7023
02:57:01,740 --> 02:57:05,450
connected to yellow green again a single
red blue and green a single blue and a

7024
02:57:05,450 --> 02:57:05,460
red blue and green a single blue and a
 

7025
02:57:05,460 --> 02:57:07,630
red blue and green a single blue and a
single yellow

7026
02:57:07,630 --> 02:57:07,640
single yellow
 

7027
02:57:07,640 --> 02:57:14,450
single yellow
four different modules

7028
02:57:14,450 --> 02:57:14,460

 

7029
02:57:14,460 --> 02:57:17,950

um

7030
02:57:17,950 --> 02:57:17,960

 

7031
02:57:17,960 --> 02:57:21,950

I want to try yellow on this side

7032
02:57:21,950 --> 02:57:21,960
I want to try yellow on this side
 

7033
02:57:21,960 --> 02:57:24,469
I want to try yellow on this side
single yellow because I oh wait that's

7034
02:57:24,469 --> 02:57:24,479
single yellow because I oh wait that's
 

7035
02:57:24,479 --> 02:57:25,910
single yellow because I oh wait that's
not yellow

7036
02:57:25,910 --> 02:57:25,920
not yellow
 

7037
02:57:25,920 --> 02:57:30,230
not yellow
or orange or whatever the fork it is

7038
02:57:30,230 --> 02:57:30,240

 

7039
02:57:30,240 --> 02:57:34,010

it goes okay because ah because like

7040
02:57:34,010 --> 02:57:34,020
it goes okay because ah because like
 

7041
02:57:34,020 --> 02:57:35,750
it goes okay because ah because like
I don't know if that has any connection

7042
02:57:35,750 --> 02:57:35,760
I don't know if that has any connection
 

7043
02:57:35,760 --> 02:57:38,690
I don't know if that has any connection
but like left yellow here close to the

7044
02:57:38,690 --> 02:57:38,700
but like left yellow here close to the
 

7045
02:57:38,700 --> 02:57:40,670
but like left yellow here close to the
left green goes to the right so maybe

7046
02:57:40,670 --> 02:57:40,680
left green goes to the right so maybe
 

7047
02:57:40,680 --> 02:57:41,450
left green goes to the right so maybe
it's

7048
02:57:41,450 --> 02:57:41,460

7216
03:02:10,250 --> 03:02:10,260
beginning that the last pattern we had
 

7217
03:02:10,260 --> 03:02:15,230
beginning that the last pattern we had
was actually correct oh maybe

7218
03:02:15,230 --> 03:02:15,240
was actually correct oh maybe
 

7219
03:02:15,240 --> 03:02:17,269
was actually correct oh maybe
because it did connect up until the

7220
03:02:17,269 --> 03:02:17,279
because it did connect up until the
 

7221
03:02:17,279 --> 03:02:22,610
because it did connect up until the
point where I stopped putting in uh

we're probably gonna die again this time
 

7331
03:05:17,460 --> 03:05:20,750
we're probably gonna die again this time
but yeah yeah so from Red it either goes

7332

7335
03:05:23,819 --> 03:05:26,450
to blue blue or blue green I'm guessing
blue blue because blue green is between

7336
03:05:26,450 --> 03:05:26,460
blue blue because blue green is between
 

7337
03:05:26,460 --> 03:05:29,929
blue blue because blue green is between
um no uh ah that One automatically

um no uh ah that One automatically
 

7339
03:05:29,939 --> 03:05:32,210
um no uh ah that One automatically
connects to one that was already placed

7340
03:05:32,210 --> 03:05:32,220
connects to one that was already placed

what wait I want to try this way
 

7367
03:06:17,840 --> 03:06:20,330
what wait I want to try this way
okay but when you trigger it it goes

7368
03:06:20,330 --> 03:06:20,340
okay but when you trigger it it goes
 

7369
03:06:20,340 --> 03:06:22,490
okay but when you trigger it it goes
from like blue orange to like a

7370
03:06:22,490 --> 03:06:22,500
from like blue orange to like a
 

7371
03:06:22,500 --> 03:06:24,530
from like blue orange to like a
different to like a orange and then to

7372
03:06:24,530 --> 03:06:24,540
different to like a orange and then to
 

7373
03:06:24,540 --> 03:06:26,929
different to like a orange and then to
Orange the green

7374
03:06:26,929 --> 03:06:26,939
Orange the green
 

7375
03:06:26,939 --> 03:06:28,790
Orange the green
and so like I could see the path of the

7376
03:06:28,790 --> 03:06:28,800
and so like I could see the path of the
 

7377
03:06:28,800 --> 03:06:30,889
and so like I could see the path of the
electricity going and so it goes from

7378
03:06:30,889 --> 03:06:30,899
electricity going and so it goes from
 

7379
03:06:30,899 --> 03:06:33,530
electricity going and so it goes from
Blue to single blue to single orange to

7380
03:06:33,530 --> 03:06:33,540
Blue to single blue to single orange to
 

7381
03:06:33,540 --> 03:06:35,990
Blue to single blue to single orange to
orange green to red and then something

7382
03:06:35,990 --> 03:06:36,000
orange green to red and then something
 

7383
03:06:36,000 --> 03:06:41,230
orange green to red and then something
was disconnected at the red one

7384
03:06:41,230 --> 03:06:41,240

 

7385
03:06:41,240 --> 03:06:44,210

I still wonder why the hell that one

7386
03:06:44,210 --> 03:06:44,220
I still wonder why the hell that one
 

7387
03:06:44,220 --> 03:06:45,950
I still wonder why the hell that one
disappeared though was it a bug because

7388
03:06:45,950 --> 03:06:45,960
disappeared though was it a bug because
 

7389
03:06:45,960 --> 03:06:47,330
disappeared though was it a bug because
the second time we did it didn't

7390
03:06:47,330 --> 03:06:47,340
the second time we did it didn't
 

7391
03:06:47,340 --> 03:06:48,290
the second time we did it didn't
disappear

7392
03:06:48,290 --> 03:06:48,300
disappear
 

7393
03:06:48,300 --> 03:06:50,030
disappear
okay blue

7394
03:06:50,030 --> 03:06:50,040
okay blue
 

7395
03:06:50,040 --> 03:06:52,429
okay blue
that must be correct

7396
03:06:52,429 --> 03:06:52,439
that must be correct
 

7397
03:06:52,439 --> 03:06:56,450
that must be correct
okay so sorry was a single blue single

7398
03:06:56,450 --> 03:06:56,460
okay so sorry was a single blue single
 

7399
03:06:56,460 --> 03:06:59,870
okay so sorry was a single blue single
orange and orange green and then I think

7400
03:06:59,870 --> 03:06:59,880
orange and orange green and then I think
 

7401
03:06:59,880 --> 03:07:01,730
orange and orange green and then I think
it was single red

7402
03:07:01,730 --> 03:07:01,740
it was single red
 

7403
03:07:01,740 --> 03:07:04,210
it was single red
yes

7404
03:07:04,210 --> 03:07:04,220
yes
 

7405
03:07:04,220 --> 03:07:07,190
yes
and that single red either connects to a

7406
03:07:07,190 --> 03:07:07,200
and that single red either connects to a
 

7407
03:07:07,200 --> 03:07:10,309
and that single red either connects to a
blue green or blue blue

7408
03:07:10,309 --> 03:07:10,319
blue green or blue blue
 

7409
03:07:10,319 --> 03:07:12,110
blue green or blue blue
which is interesting because the wire

7410
03:07:12,110 --> 03:07:12,120
which is interesting because the wire
 

7411
03:07:12,120 --> 03:07:14,210
which is interesting because the wire
connected to the tower is where the

7412
03:07:14,210 --> 03:07:14,220
connected to the tower is where the
 

7413
03:07:14,220 --> 03:07:17,870
connected to the tower is where the
pre-placed fuses which is a red blue but

7414
03:07:17,870 --> 03:07:17,880
pre-placed fuses which is a red blue but
 

7415
03:07:17,880 --> 03:07:20,389
pre-placed fuses which is a red blue but
I can connect it to one one more tower

7416
03:07:20,389 --> 03:07:20,399
I can connect it to one one more tower
 

7417
03:07:20,399 --> 03:07:22,969
I can connect it to one one more tower
that doesn't have a fuse in it and I

7418
03:07:22,969 --> 03:07:22,979
that doesn't have a fuse in it and I
 

7419
03:07:22,979 --> 03:07:26,170
that doesn't have a fuse in it and I
have left the following colors orange

7420
03:07:26,170 --> 03:07:26,180
have left the following colors orange
 

7421
03:07:26,180 --> 03:07:30,290
have left the following colors orange
green only red red blue blue and green

7422
03:07:30,290 --> 03:07:30,300
green only red red blue blue and green
 

7423
03:07:30,300 --> 03:07:32,450
green only red red blue blue and green
red

7424
03:07:32,450 --> 03:07:32,460
red
 

7425
03:07:32,460 --> 03:07:35,570
red
I think I would go

7426
03:07:35,570 --> 03:07:35,580
I think I would go
 

7427
03:07:35,580 --> 03:07:37,790
I think I would go
yeah out of all those patterns I think

7428
03:07:37,790 --> 03:07:37,800
yeah out of all those patterns I think
 

7429
03:07:37,800 --> 03:07:39,769
yeah out of all those patterns I think
only blue blue is the one that because

7430
03:07:39,769 --> 03:07:39,779
only blue blue is the one that because
 

7431
03:07:39,779 --> 03:07:41,929
only blue blue is the one that because
there's a red green but not a green red

7432
03:07:41,929 --> 03:07:41,939
there's a red green but not a green red
 

7433
03:07:41,939 --> 03:07:44,030
there's a red green but not a green red
okay let me try again maybe it was

7434
03:07:44,030 --> 03:07:44,040
okay let me try again maybe it was
 

7435
03:07:44,040 --> 03:07:45,830
okay let me try again maybe it was
really just the timing that the time was

7436
03:07:45,830 --> 03:07:45,840
really just the timing that the time was
 

7437
03:07:45,840 --> 03:07:52,610
really just the timing that the time was
already home over

7438
03:07:52,610 --> 03:07:52,620

 

7439
03:07:52,620 --> 03:07:55,130

your place is wrong can I remove that I

7440
03:07:55,130 --> 03:07:55,140
your place is wrong can I remove that I
 

7441
03:07:55,140 --> 03:07:59,269
your place is wrong can I remove that I
don't think I could

7442
03:07:59,269 --> 03:07:59,279

 

7443
03:07:59,279 --> 03:08:01,670

I know when it gets to Red it just it

7444
03:08:01,670 --> 03:08:01,680
I know when it gets to Red it just it
 

7445
03:08:01,680 --> 03:08:04,010
I know when it gets to Red it just it
just pops a ton it doesn't or something

7446
03:08:04,010 --> 03:08:04,020
just pops a ton it doesn't or something
 

7447
03:08:04,020 --> 03:08:06,410
just pops a ton it doesn't or something
okay then I guess

7448
03:08:06,410 --> 03:08:06,420
okay then I guess
 

7449
03:08:06,420 --> 03:08:09,050
okay then I guess
it because I can't I cannot remove the

7450
03:08:09,050 --> 03:08:09,060
it because I can't I cannot remove the
 

7451
03:08:09,060 --> 03:08:11,690
it because I can't I cannot remove the
one that's already pre-placed

7452
03:08:11,690 --> 03:08:11,700
one that's already pre-placed
 

7453
03:08:11,700 --> 03:08:13,610
one that's already pre-placed
but I guess the blue one is wrong after

7454
03:08:13,610 --> 03:08:13,620
but I guess the blue one is wrong after
 

7455
03:08:13,620 --> 03:08:15,410
but I guess the blue one is wrong after
all

7456
03:08:15,410 --> 03:08:15,420
all
 

7457
03:08:15,420 --> 03:08:16,630

single red oh
 

7507
03:09:44,420 --> 03:09:47,090
single red oh
but blue is where the electricity

7508
03:09:47,090 --> 03:09:47,100
but blue is where the electricity
 

7509
03:09:47,100 --> 03:09:48,769
but blue is where the electricity
started the single blue so I don't think

7510

started the single blue so I don't think
 

7511
03:09:48,779 --> 03:09:51,550
started the single blue so I don't think
it's that one I don't know

7512

supposed to go Blue to Orange to orange
 

7521
03:10:06,180 --> 03:10:10,750
supposed to go Blue to Orange to orange
green to blue green

7522
03:10:10,750 --> 03:10:10,760

 

7523
03:10:10,760 --> 03:10:13,429

repeat that please we're about to die

7525
03:10:13,439 --> 03:10:16,550
repeat that please we're about to die
properly man oh uh well it starts at

7526
03:10:16,550 --> 03:10:16,560
properly man oh uh well it starts at
 

7527
03:10:16,560 --> 03:10:18,170
properly man oh uh well it starts at
blue and then it goes to Orange and then

7528
03:10:18,170 --> 03:10:18,180
blue and then it goes to Orange and then
 

7529
03:10:18,180 --> 03:10:19,910
blue and then it goes to Orange and then
it goes to orange green and maybe it's

7530
03:10:19,910 --> 03:10:19,920
it goes to orange green and maybe it's
 

7531
03:10:19,920 --> 03:10:21,710
it goes to orange green and maybe it's
supposed to go to blue green and then to

7532
03:10:21,710 --> 03:10:21,720
supposed to go to blue green and then to
 

7533
03:10:21,720 --> 03:10:23,870
supposed to go to blue green and then to
red

7534
03:10:23,870 --> 03:10:23,880
red
 

7535
03:10:23,880 --> 03:10:27,070

03:10:37,979 --> 03:10:39,650

maybe we should start on a different one

7544
03:10:39,650 --> 03:10:39,660
maybe we should start on a different one
 

7545
03:10:39,660 --> 03:10:41,510
maybe we should start on a different one
more try wait wait no those are

7546

more try wait wait no those are
 

7547
03:10:41,520 --> 03:10:43,929
more try wait wait no those are
connecting fine I think

7548
03:10:43,929 --> 03:10:43,939
connecting fine I think
 

7549
03:10:43,939 --> 03:10:47,330
connecting fine I think
yeah but it always gets I put a

7550
03:10:47,330 --> 03:10:47,340
yeah but it always gets I put a
 

7551
03:10:47,340 --> 03:10:49,389

7563
03:11:07,340 --> 03:11:10,250

because it's incorrect this one is but

7564

7569
03:11:18,239 --> 03:11:20,750

next time probably start on a different

7570
03:11:20,750 --> 03:11:20,760
next time probably start on a different
 

7571
03:11:20,760 --> 03:11:22,849
next time probably start on a different
one other than just a single bloop well

7572
03:11:22,849 --> 03:11:22,859
one other than just a single bloop well
 

7573
03:11:22,859 --> 03:11:24,110

I don't know how it works on your side

7574
03:11:24,110 --> 03:11:24,120
I don't know how it works on your side
 

7575
03:11:24,120 --> 03:11:26,210
I don't know how it works on your side
but we might have to start from a

7576
03:11:26,210 --> 03:11:26,220
but we might have to start from a
 

7577
03:11:26,220 --> 03:11:28,070
but we might have to start from a
different area like a different path oh

7578
03:11:28,070 --> 03:11:28,080
different area like a different path oh
 

7579
03:11:28,080 --> 03:11:30,290

7585
03:11:35,880 --> 03:11:37,429
oh yeah
okay we could do that because the red

7586
03:11:37,429 --> 03:11:37,439
okay we could do that because the red
 

7587
03:11:37,439 --> 03:11:39,290
okay we could do that because the red
green only connects to two it either

7588

8075
03:25:11,939 --> 03:25:14,570
um
I guess for the last riddle there was

8076
03:25:14,570 --> 03:25:14,580
I guess for the last riddle there was
 

8077
03:25:14,580 --> 03:25:15,710
I guess for the last riddle there was
just like

8078
03:25:15,710 --> 03:25:15,720
just like
 

8079
03:25:15,720 --> 03:25:16,429
just like
um

8080
03:25:16,429 --> 03:25:16,439
um
 

8081
03:25:16,439 --> 03:25:20,990
um
like uh the way we started out was a

8082
03:25:20,990 --> 03:25:21,000
like uh the way we started out was a
 

8083
03:25:21,000 --> 03:25:23,389
like uh the way we started out was a
connection that was possible but not

8084
03:25:23,389 --> 03:25:23,399
connection that was possible but not
 

8085
03:25:23,399 --> 03:25:25,429
connection that was possible but not
possible until the very end

8086
03:25:25,429 --> 03:25:25,439
possible until the very end
 

8087
03:25:25,439 --> 03:25:27,110
possible until the very end
so

8088
03:25:27,110 --> 03:25:27,120
so
 

8089
03:25:27,120 --> 03:25:29,450
so
like it was able to connect until a

8090
03:25:29,450 --> 03:25:29,460
like it was able to connect until a
 

8091
03:25:29,460 --> 03:25:31,429
like it was able to connect until a
certain point but that's where you know

8092
03:25:31,429 --> 03:25:31,439
certain point but that's where you know
 

8093
03:25:31,439 --> 03:25:34,070
certain point but that's where you know
we were missing parts and that's and

8094
03:25:34,070 --> 03:25:34,080
we were missing parts and that's and
 

8095
03:25:34,080 --> 03:25:36,590
we were missing parts and that's and
that's why we had to go back and try a

8096
03:25:36,590 --> 03:25:36,600
that's why we had to go back and try a
 

8097
03:25:36,600 --> 03:25:38,929
that's why we had to go back and try a
different combination like until a

8098
03:25:38,929 --> 03:25:38,939
different combination like until a
 

8099
03:25:38,939 --> 03:25:40,610
different combination like until a
certain point the combination was was

8100
03:25:40,610 --> 03:25:40,620
certain point the combination was was
 

8101
03:25:40,620 --> 03:25:42,830
certain point the combination was was
working and then I just answered another

8102
03:25:42,830 --> 03:25:42,840
working and then I just answered another
 

8103
03:25:42,840 --> 03:25:44,570
working and then I just answered another
point it doesn't work anymore so you

8104
03:25:44,570 --> 03:25:44,580
point it doesn't work anymore so you
 

8105
03:25:44,580 --> 03:25:46,429
point it doesn't work anymore so you
gotta try something else

8106
03:25:46,429 --> 03:25:46,439
gotta try something else
 

8107
03:25:46,439 --> 03:25:48,849

her fruity 90 seems buggy seems the fact

9242
03:54:34,070 --> 03:54:34,080
her fruity 90 seems buggy seems the fact
 

9243
03:54:34,080 --> 03:54:36,889
her fruity 90 seems buggy seems the fact
that really

9244
03:54:36,889 --> 03:54:36,899

 

9245
03:54:36,899 --> 03:54:39,110

the walkie-talkies don't make the game

9246
03:54:39,110 --> 03:54:39,120
the walkie-talkies don't make the game
 

9247
03:54:39,120 --> 03:54:41,630
the walkie-talkies don't make the game
better yeah especially if like I thought

9248
03:54:41,630 --> 03:54:41,640
better yeah especially if like I thought
 

9249
03:54:41,640 --> 03:54:42,830
better yeah especially if like I thought
that you

9250
03:54:42,830 --> 03:54:42,840
that you
 

9251
03:54:42,840 --> 03:54:45,349
that you
um I found that in the game you can only

9252
03:54:45,349 --> 03:54:45,359
um I found that in the game you can only
 

9253
03:54:45,359 --> 03:54:48,410
um I found that in the game you can only
hear yours the other person up to a

9254
03:54:48,410 --> 03:54:48,420
hear yours the other person up to a
 

9255
03:54:48,420 --> 03:54:49,929
hear yours the other person up to a
certain distance

9256
03:54:49,929 --> 03:54:49,939
certain distance
 

9257
03:54:49,939 --> 03:54:52,550
certain distance
and and that's why I thought it's like

9258
03:54:52,550 --> 03:54:52,560
and and that's why I thought it's like
 

9259
03:54:52,560 --> 03:54:54,290
and and that's why I thought it's like
really necessary to use the in-game

9260
03:54:54,290 --> 03:54:54,300
really necessary to use the in-game
 

9261
03:54:54,300 --> 03:54:55,910
really necessary to use the in-game
audio but but apparently no the

9262
03:54:55,910 --> 03:54:55,920
audio but but apparently no the
 

9263
03:54:55,920 --> 03:54:57,469
audio but but apparently no the
walkie-talk doesn't work anywhere no

9264
03:54:57,469 --> 03:54:57,479
walkie-talk doesn't work anywhere no
 

9265
03:54:57,479 --> 03:55:02,870
walkie-talk doesn't work anywhere no
matter where you are huh

9266
03:55:02,870 --> 03:55:02,880

9282
03:55:19,849 --> 03:55:19,859
without the walkie-talkies in the end
 

9283

I just really wanted to fix it but the
 

9287
03:55:24,120 --> 03:55:29,030
I just really wanted to fix it but the
game didn't want me to fix it

9288
03:55:29,030 --> 03:55:29,040

 

9289
03:55:29,040 --> 03:55:31,130

9317
03:56:09,120 --> 03:56:12,229
which I think was closed by the AMD but
I don't know them

I think I turned it back on and when it
turned itself back on

9334

9405
03:58:10,500 --> 03:58:12,429
everyone who says they can tell the

03:58:12,429 --> 03:58:12,439
difference I think is just imagining it
 

9407
03:58:12,439 --> 03:58:14,630
difference I think is just imagining it
because I can't really tell a difference

9408
03:58:14,630 --> 03:58:14,640
