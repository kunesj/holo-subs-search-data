like my usual streaming
time H then it would be fine then I'd

9706
05:17:54,510 --> 05:17:54,520
time H then it would be fine then I'd
 

9707
05:17:54,520 --> 05:17:57,270
time H then it would be fine then I'd
have enough time to practice but I

9708
05:17:57,270 --> 05:17:57,280
have enough time to practice but I
 

9709
05:17:57,280 --> 05:18:01,070
have enough time to practice but I
wanted to do it during like prime time

9710
05:18:01,070 --> 05:18:01,080
wanted to do it during like prime time
 

9711
05:18:01,080 --> 05:18:02,350
wanted to do it during like prime time
for

05:18:05,830 --> 05:18:05,840
Asia for once very
 

9715
05:18:05,840 --> 05:18:08,230
Asia for once very
rarely but maybe I'll just do it during

9716
05:18:08,230 --> 05:18:08,240
rarely but maybe I'll just do it during
 

9717
05:18:08,240 --> 05:18:10,110
rarely but maybe I'll just do it during
my normal

9718
05:18:10,110 --> 05:18:10,120
my normal
 

9719
05:18:10,120 --> 05:18:13,230
my normal
time and then rebroadcast it

9720
05:18:13,230 --> 05:18:13,240
time and then rebroadcast it
 

9721
05:18:13,240 --> 05:18:17,110
time and then rebroadcast it
during Asia friendly

9722
05:18:17,110 --> 05:18:17,120
during Asia friendly
 

9723
05:18:17,120 --> 05:18:19,510

even more about the story of Diablo if

9866
05:22:49,548 --> 05:22:49,558
even more about the story of Diablo if
 

9867
05:22:49,558 --> 05:22:52,470
even more about the story of Diablo if

9868
05:22:52,470 --> 05:22:52,480

 

9869
05:22:52,480 --> 05:22:56,110

05:22:56,110 --> 05:22:56,120
it uh but Poe is at least fresh and new
 

9871
05:22:56,120 --> 05:23:02,270

9875
05:23:10,000 --> 05:23:12,310

I still like Diablo if Diablo 4 is one

9876
05:23:12,310 --> 05:23:12,320
I still like Diablo if Diablo 4 is one
 

9877
05:23:12,320 --> 05:23:13,990
I still like Diablo if Diablo 4 is one
or two streams from being finished yeah

9878
05:23:13,990 --> 05:23:14,000
or two streams from being finished yeah
 

9879
05:23:14,000 --> 05:23:16,708
or two streams from being finished yeah
like at least the before the

9880
05:23:16,708 --> 05:23:16,718
like at least the before the
 

9881
05:23:16,718 --> 05:23:20,510

think that like even if I finish the
main story in the end the DLC thing

9886
05:23:25,750 --> 05:23:25,760
main story in the end the DLC thing
 

9887
05:23:25,760 --> 05:23:27,628
main story in the end the DLC thing
whether or not it will happen is kind of

9888
05:23:27,628 --> 05:23:27,638
whether or not it will happen is kind of
 

9889
05:23:27,638 --> 05:23:30,310
whether or not it will happen is kind of
questionable

or two more streams then not too bad to

9896
05:23:37,030 --> 05:23:37,040
or two more streams then not too bad to
 

9897
05:23:37,040 --> 05:23:40,150
or two more streams then not too bad to
have it going uh around the same time

9898
05:23:40,150 --> 05:23:40,160
have it going uh around the same time
 

9899
