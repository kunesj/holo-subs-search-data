greens ones okay let's try the green one
then maybe

7196
03:29:22,370 --> 03:29:22,380
then maybe
 

7197
03:29:22,380 --> 03:29:24,650
then maybe
I wonder if it matters where I am too

7198
03:29:24,650 --> 03:29:24,660
I wonder if it matters where I am too
 

7199

maybe from the one with the door where

7200
03:29:26,870 --> 03:29:26,880
maybe from the one with the door where
 

7201
03:29:26,880 --> 03:29:28,729
maybe from the one with the door where
was the other green one

7202
03:29:28,729 --> 03:29:28,739
was the other green one
 

7203

7205
03:29:40,380 --> 03:29:42,830

we'll check it out

7206
03:29:42,830 --> 03:29:42,840
we'll check it out
 

7207
03:29:42,840 --> 03:29:45,050
we'll check it out
we have to have a feeling we need to

7208
03:29:45,050 --> 03:29:45,060
we have to have a feeling we need to
 

7209
03:29:45,060 --> 03:29:47,389
we have to have a feeling we need to
understand where are we going kettle

7210
03:29:47,389 --> 03:29:47,399
understand where are we going kettle
 

7211
03:29:47,399 --> 03:29:52,070

oh where was it

7214
03:29:56,090 --> 03:29:56,100

 

7215
03:29:56,100 --> 03:29:58,670

okay yeah if I saw the door triggers so

7216
03:29:58,670 --> 03:29:58,680
okay yeah if I saw the door triggers so
 

7217
03:29:58,680 --> 03:30:00,590
okay yeah if I saw the door triggers so
so the ones without the doors are always

7218
03:30:00,590 --> 03:30:00,600
so the ones without the doors are always
 

7219
03:30:00,600 --> 03:30:02,330
so the ones without the doors are always
the goals

7220
03:30:02,330 --> 03:30:02,340
the goals
 

7221
03:30:02,340 --> 03:30:05,269
the goals
maybe so the blue one is the goal so the

7222
03:30:05,269 --> 03:30:05,279
maybe so the blue one is the goal so the
 

7223
03:30:05,279 --> 03:30:08,330
maybe so the blue one is the goal so the
other blue one is probably not here so

7224
03:30:08,330 --> 03:30:08,340
other blue one is probably not here so

flying faster when I get slower
 

7569
03:40:30,960 --> 03:40:34,490
flying faster when I get slower
I guess I

7570
03:40:34,490 --> 03:40:34,500

 

7571
03:40:34,500 --> 03:40:39,349

7587
03:41:01,020 --> 03:41:07,670
telling me it's not enough can we get
much faster too fast

7588
03:41:07,670 --> 03:41:07,680

 

7589
03:41:07,680 --> 03:41:10,969

I'll play so I mean I feel pretty fast

7590
03:41:10,969 --> 03:41:10,979
I'll play so I mean I feel pretty fast
 

7591
03:41:10,979 --> 03:41:13,309

7595
03:41:20,340 --> 03:41:22,910

but I won't be able to jump fast at like

7596
03:41:22,910 --> 03:41:22,920
but I won't be able to jump fast at like
 

7597
03:41:22,920 --> 03:41:26,630
but I won't be able to jump fast at like
High Enough

7598
03:41:26,630 --> 03:41:26,640

 

7599
03:41:26,640 --> 03:41:29,929

7600
03:41:29,929 --> 03:41:29,939
maybe if I really only jump It's jumping
 

7601
03:41:29,939 --> 03:41:33,950
maybe if I really only jump It's jumping

7602
03:41:33,950 --> 03:41:33,960

 

7603
03:41:33,960 --> 03:41:36,290

03:41:40,670 --> 03:41:40,680

 

7607
03:41:40,680 --> 03:41:41,950

really won't be able to reach it unless

7612
03:41:47,510 --> 03:41:47,520
really won't be able to reach it unless
 

7613
03:41:47,520 --> 03:41:51,190
really won't be able to reach it unless
I can jump high so that just makes me

7614
03:41:51,190 --> 03:41:51,200
I can jump high so that just makes me
 

7615
03:41:51,200 --> 03:41:54,769
I can jump high so that just makes me
jump further perhaps but I need

7616
03:41:54,769 --> 03:41:54,779
jump further perhaps but I need
 

7617
03:41:54,779 --> 03:41:56,690
jump further perhaps but I need
something also that makes me jump higher

7618
03:41:56,690 --> 03:41:56,700
something also that makes me jump higher
 

7619
03:41:56,700 --> 03:42:01,969
something also that makes me jump higher
it was better that was for sure

7620
03:42:01,969 --> 03:42:01,979

 

7621
03:42:01,979 --> 03:42:05,210

7643
03:42:43,200 --> 03:42:46,190

I wanna I hope I'm close to the end I'm

7644
03:42:46,190 --> 03:42:46,200
I wanna I hope I'm close to the end I'm
 

7645
03:42:46,200 --> 03:42:50,630
I wanna I hope I'm close to the end I'm
I'm getting a bit tired of it

7646
03:42:50,630 --> 03:42:50,640
I'm getting a bit tired of it
 

7647
03:42:50,640 --> 03:42:53,030
I'm getting a bit tired of it
because now like I solved everything

7648
03:42:53,030 --> 03:42:53,040
because now like I solved everything
 

7649
03:42:53,040 --> 03:42:59,410
because now like I solved everything
that seemed relatively easy

7650
03:42:59,410 --> 03:42:59,420

 

7651
03:42:59,420 --> 03:43:04,070

what is that

7652
03:43:04,070 --> 03:43:04,080

 

7653
03:43:04,080 --> 03:43:05,809

oh

7654

7660
03:43:14,150 --> 03:43:14,160
supposedly
 

7661
03:43:14,160 --> 03:43:21,830
supposedly
I still need to go to the top now

7662
03:43:21,830 --> 03:43:21,840

 

7663
03:43:21,840 --> 03:43:25,309

03:43:30,779 --> 03:43:35,050
okay so this one all the way until
oh the other side of the bridge

7668
03:43:35,050 --> 03:43:35,060

 

7669
03:43:35,060 --> 03:43:38,990

[Music]

7670
03:43:38,990 --> 03:43:39,000
[Music]
 

7671
03:43:39,000 --> 03:43:42,229
[Music]
now

7672
03:43:42,229 --> 03:43:42,239

 

7673
03:43:42,239 --> 03:43:46,610

you can just skip all this stuff can I

7674
03:43:46,610 --> 03:43:46,620

 

7675
03:43:46,620 --> 03:43:53,389

how

7676
03:43:53,389 --> 03:43:53,399

 

7677
03:43:53,399 --> 03:43:55,550

this one had a long one yeah yeah you

7678
03:43:55,550 --> 03:43:55,560
this one had a long one yeah yeah you
 

7679
03:43:55,560 --> 03:43:56,929
this one had a long one yeah yeah you
can already get in the book yeah I guess

7680
03:43:56,929 --> 03:43:56,939
can already get in the book yeah I guess
 

7681
03:43:56,939 --> 03:43:59,030
can already get in the book yeah I guess
so I guess yeah let's see what happens

7682
03:43:59,030 --> 03:43:59,040
so I guess yeah let's see what happens
 

7683
03:43:59,040 --> 03:44:03,769
so I guess yeah let's see what happens
if I get into the boat

7684
03:44:03,769 --> 03:44:03,779

 

7685
03:44:03,779 --> 03:44:09,050

is that the end of the game

7686
03:44:09,050 --> 03:44:09,060

 

7687
03:44:09,060 --> 03:44:11,450

but then what about what is the meaning

7688
03:44:11,450 --> 03:44:11,460
but then what about what is the meaning
 

7689
03:44:11,460 --> 03:44:13,250
but then what about what is the meaning
behind all the I guess maybe just for

7690
03:44:13,250 --> 03:44:13,260
behind all the I guess maybe just for
 

7691
03:44:13,260 --> 03:44:16,429
behind all the I guess maybe just for
completionist but it feels like

7692
03:44:16,429 --> 03:44:16,439
completionist but it feels like
 

7693
03:44:16,439 --> 03:44:17,750
completionist but it feels like
I was

7694
03:44:17,750 --> 03:44:17,760
I was
 

7695
03:44:17,760 --> 03:44:22,790
I was
I don't know it's too easy to

7696
03:44:22,790 --> 03:44:22,800

 

7697
03:44:22,800 --> 03:44:25,190

achieve this

7698
03:44:25,190 --> 03:44:25,200
achieve this
 

7699
03:44:25,200 --> 03:44:32,690
achieve this
foreign

7700
03:44:32,690 --> 03:44:32,700

 

7701
03:44:32,700 --> 03:44:36,110

7705
03:44:39,180 --> 03:44:45,769
well I mean it's it's raining okay well
we can solve that probably

7706
03:44:45,769 --> 03:44:45,779

 

7707
03:44:45,779 --> 03:44:53,510

well that's ridiculous

7708
03:44:53,510 --> 03:44:53,520

 

7709
03:44:53,520 --> 03:44:56,150

okay I said I'm getting bored of it and

7710
03:44:56,150 --> 03:44:56,160
okay I said I'm getting bored of it and
 

7711
03:44:56,160 --> 03:44:57,710
okay I said I'm getting bored of it and
I would be happy if it ends soon but

7712
03:44:57,710 --> 03:44:57,720
I would be happy if it ends soon but
 

7713
03:44:57,720 --> 03:44:59,330
I would be happy if it ends soon but
that would be like I don't know it feels

7714
03:44:59,330 --> 03:44:59,340
that would be like I don't know it feels
 

7715
03:44:59,340 --> 03:45:00,410
that would be like I don't know it feels
it feels

7716
03:45:00,410 --> 03:45:00,420
it feels
 

7717
03:45:00,420 --> 03:45:02,530
it feels
