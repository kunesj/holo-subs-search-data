00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:19,080
bentle or eat a
 

635
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,789

643
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,390
Japan but it doesn't say and they're
always very vague and and do whatever

644
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:31,400
always very vague and and do whatever
 

645
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,110
always very vague and and do whatever
the you want with it kind of style

646
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:34,120

that and then um it kind of loses that
 

1897
00:53:40,799 --> 00:53:42,750
that and then um it kind of loses that

1913
00:54:06,359 --> 00:54:08,950
you're supposed to be able to perfectly
mimic the

1914
00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:08,960
mimic the
 

1915
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:13,069
mimic the
choreography as it was created by the

1916
00:54:13,069 --> 00:54:13,079
choreography as it was created by the
 

1917
00:54:13,079 --> 00:54:15,670
choreography as it was created by the
dancer who made it the

1918
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:15,680
dancer who made it the
 

1919
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:18,069
dancer who made it the
choreographer and

00:54:18,069 --> 00:54:18,079
choreographer and

00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:21,230
choreographer and
then if you can do that that that just

1922
00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:21,240
then if you can do that that that just
 

1923
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,030
then if you can do that that that just
means you're really

1924
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:23,040
means you're really
 

1925
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:29,430
means you're really
good that you can still like M add your

little little
 

1931
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,990
little little
marking I guess but I think it's very

1932
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:36,000
marking I guess but I think it's very
 

1933
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,230
marking I guess but I think it's very
different from when you're still an

1934
00:54:41,230 --> 00:54:41,240

 

1935
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:44,549

amateur like I can't

00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:52,880

 

1941
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,390

experienced I I wouldn't say much of a

1942
00:54:55,390 --> 00:54:55,400
experienced I I wouldn't say much of a
 

1943
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:58,069
experienced I I wouldn't say much of a
own twist it's like like you can try to

1944
00:54:58,069 --> 00:54:58,079
own twist it's like like you can try to
 

1945
00:54:58,079 --> 00:54:59,670
own twist it's like like you can try to
add more

1946
00:54:59,670 --> 00:54:59,680
add more
 

1947
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:03,349
add more
um what's the word

1948
00:55:03,349 --> 00:55:03,359

 

1949
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:06,390

nuance like you can try to hit certain

1950
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:06,400
nuance like you can try to hit certain
 

1951
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,470
nuance like you can try to hit certain
dance moves

1952
00:55:08,470 --> 00:55:08,480
dance moves
 

1953
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:11,549
dance moves
stronger uh with more punch and all that

1954
00:55:11,549 --> 00:55:11,559
stronger uh with more punch and all that
 

1955
00:55:11,559 --> 00:55:14,430
stronger uh with more punch and all that
but I feel like the personality gets

1956
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:14,440
but I feel like the personality gets
 

1957
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:18,510
but I feel like the personality gets
just lost in a way

1958
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:18,520

exactly as what I've been uh looking at
when learning the

1980
00:55:51,589 --> 00:55:51,599
when learning the
 

1981
