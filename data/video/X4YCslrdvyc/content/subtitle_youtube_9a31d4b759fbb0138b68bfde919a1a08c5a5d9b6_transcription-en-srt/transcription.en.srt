thinking about this before but
 

4887
02:51:51,120 --> 02:51:54,150
thinking about this before but
hearing songs in my first

4888
02:51:54,150 --> 02:51:54,160
hearing songs in my first
 

4889
02:51:54,160 --> 02:51:58,150
hearing songs in my first
language it's so weird for me it's just

4890
02:51:58,150 --> 02:51:58,160
language it's so weird for me it's just
 

4891
02:51:58,160 --> 02:52:00,950
language it's so weird for me it's just
it's very awkward and it feels cringy to

4892
02:52:00,950 --> 02:52:00,960
it's very awkward and it feels cringy to
 

4893
02:52:00,960 --> 02:52:01,990
it's very awkward and it feels cringy to
me

4894

me
 

4895
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:04,389
me
but hearing songs in english feels so

4896
02:52:04,389 --> 02:52:04,399
but hearing songs in english feels so
 

4897
02:52:04,399 --> 02:52:06,469
but hearing songs in english feels so
smooth and natural to me

4898
02:52:06,469 --> 02:52:06,479
smooth and natural to me
 

4899
02:52:06,479 --> 02:52:08,870
