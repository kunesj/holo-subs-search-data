effects and voices but once I had the

8094
03:55:13,550 --> 03:55:13,560
effects and voices but once I had the
 

8095
03:55:13,560 --> 03:55:15,590
effects and voices but once I had the
music I felt like it was already so

8096
03:55:15,590 --> 03:55:15,600
music I felt like it was already so
 

8097
03:55:15,600 --> 03:55:18,650
music I felt like it was already so
beautiful that I didn't want to intrude

8098
03:55:18,650 --> 03:55:18,660
beautiful that I didn't want to intrude
 

8099
03:55:18,660 --> 03:55:19,750
beautiful that I didn't want to intrude
too much

8100
03:55:19,750 --> 03:55:19,760
too much
 

8101
03:55:19,760 --> 03:55:22,670
too much
but then when I saw the version with the

8102
03:55:22,670 --> 03:55:22,680
but then when I saw the version with the
 

8103
03:55:22,680 --> 03:55:24,170
but then when I saw the version with the
music and the sound effects I felt like

8104
03:55:24,170 --> 03:55:24,180
music and the sound effects I felt like
 

8105
03:55:24,180 --> 03:55:26,330
music and the sound effects I felt like
maybe I could have combined it so maybe

8106
03:55:26,330 --> 03:55:26,340
maybe I could have combined it so maybe
 

8107
03:55:26,340 --> 03:55:28,670
maybe I could have combined it so maybe
next time if I make something like this

8108
03:55:28,670 --> 03:55:28,680
next time if I make something like this
 

8109
03:55:28,680 --> 03:55:30,729
next time if I make something like this
again

8110
03:55:30,729 --> 03:55:30,739
again
 

8111
03:55:30,739 --> 03:55:34,189
again
oh I was thinking of you know maybe

8112
03:55:34,189 --> 03:55:34,199
oh I was thinking of you know maybe
 

8113
03:55:34,199 --> 03:55:36,469
oh I was thinking of you know maybe
doing more of these animations to

8114
03:55:36,469 --> 03:55:36,479
doing more of these animations to
 

8115
03:55:36,479 --> 03:55:37,910
doing more of these animations to
continue the lore because I was like

8116
03:55:37,910 --> 03:55:37,920
continue the lore because I was like
 

8117
03:55:37,920 --> 03:55:41,389
continue the lore because I was like
inspired and I had ideas for Pia Kiara

8118
03:55:41,389 --> 03:55:41,399
inspired and I had ideas for Pia Kiara
 

8119
03:55:41,399 --> 03:55:45,170
inspired and I had ideas for Pia Kiara
Alters Adventures

8120
03:55:45,170 --> 03:55:45,180
Alters Adventures
 

8121
03:55:45,180 --> 03:55:47,450
Alters Adventures
um but

8122
03:55:47,450 --> 03:55:47,460
um but
 

8123
03:55:47,460 --> 03:55:49,790
um but
but I was thinking maybe maybe I should

8124
03:55:49,790 --> 03:55:49,800
but I was thinking maybe maybe I should
 

8125
03:55:49,800 --> 03:55:52,070
but I was thinking maybe maybe I should
crowdfund it

8126
03:55:52,070 --> 03:55:52,080
crowdfund it
 

8127
03:55:52,080 --> 03:55:53,689
crowdfund it
because if we're gonna do that it's

8128
03:55:53,689 --> 03:55:53,699
because if we're gonna do that it's
 

8129
03:55:53,699 --> 03:55:59,889
because if we're gonna do that it's
gonna mean

8130
03:55:59,889 --> 03:55:59,899

 

8131
03:55:59,899 --> 03:56:03,070

but I still don't know if um management

8132
03:56:03,070 --> 03:56:03,080
but I still don't know if um management
 

8133
03:56:03,080 --> 03:56:07,969
but I still don't know if um management
allows something like that

8134
03:56:07,969 --> 03:56:07,979

 

8135
03:56:07,979 --> 03:56:10,010

like I'm not gonna do 30 minute episodes

8136
03:56:10,010 --> 03:56:10,020
like I'm not gonna do 30 minute episodes
 

8137
03:56:10,020 --> 03:56:12,530
like I'm not gonna do 30 minute episodes
obviously but

8138
03:56:12,530 --> 03:56:12,540
obviously but
 

8139
03:56:12,540 --> 03:56:19,790
obviously but
um

8140
03:56:19,790 --> 03:56:19,800

 

8141
03:56:19,800 --> 03:56:21,769

ah

8142
03:56:21,769 --> 03:56:21,779

I was hoping you can crowd something

8146
03:56:29,990 --> 03:56:30,000
I was hoping you can crowd something
 

8147
03:56:30,000 --> 03:56:31,070
I was hoping you can crowd something
instead of paying out of your own

8148
03:56:31,070 --> 03:56:31,080
instead of paying out of your own
 

8149
03:56:31,080 --> 03:56:32,809
instead of paying out of your own
pockets and the good thing is with

8150
03:56:32,809 --> 03:56:32,819
pockets and the good thing is with
 

8151
03:56:32,819 --> 03:56:35,030
pockets and the good thing is with
crowdfunding that I don't have to you

8152
03:56:35,030 --> 03:56:35,040
crowdfunding that I don't have to you
 

8153
03:56:35,040 --> 03:56:37,670
crowdfunding that I don't have to you

would be smarter to just like directly

8166
03:56:50,170 --> 03:56:50,180
would be smarter to just like directly
 

8167
03:56:50,180 --> 03:56:53,210
would be smarter to just like directly

um that would like be
 

8173
03:56:57,359 --> 03:56:59,809
um that would like be
smarter and Theory

8174
03:56:59,809 --> 03:56:59,819
smarter and Theory
 

8175
03:56:59,819 --> 03:57:04,429
smarter and Theory
yeah

8176
03:57:04,429 --> 03:57:04,439

 

8177
03:57:04,439 --> 03:57:06,469

it's just better for both parties

8178
03:57:06,469 --> 03:57:06,479
it's just better for both parties
 

8179
03:57:06,479 --> 03:57:11,510
it's just better for both parties
involved or all parties involved

8180
03:57:11,510 --> 03:57:11,520

 

8181
03:57:11,520 --> 03:57:14,809

Labs maybe maybe YouTube doesn't take a

8186
03:57:18,349 --> 03:57:18,359
Labs maybe maybe YouTube doesn't take a
 

8187
03:57:18,359 --> 03:57:23,389
Labs maybe maybe YouTube doesn't take a
cut but the company still takes a cut so

8188
03:57:23,389 --> 03:57:23,399

 

8189
03:57:23,399 --> 03:57:25,309

I don't know if that makes sense to do

8190
03:57:25,309 --> 03:57:25,319
I don't know if that makes sense to do
 

8191
03:57:25,319 --> 03:57:28,130
I don't know if that makes sense to do
that

8192
03:57:28,130 --> 03:57:28,140

 

8193
03:57:28,140 --> 03:57:30,110

might be the exact issue cover might

8194
03:57:30,110 --> 03:57:30,120
might be the exact issue cover might
 

8195
03:57:30,120 --> 03:57:32,090
might be the exact issue cover might
have with it with it though that's what

8196
03:57:32,090 --> 03:57:32,100
have with it with it though that's what
 

8197
03:57:32,100 --> 03:57:35,269
have with it with it though that's what
I've think too but who knows who knows

8198
03:57:35,269 --> 03:57:35,279
I've think too but who knows who knows
 

8199
03:57:35,279 --> 03:57:37,610
I've think too but who knows who knows
if it's for like a very specific project

8200
03:57:37,610 --> 03:57:37,620
if it's for like a very specific project
 

8201
03:57:37,620 --> 03:57:40,370
if it's for like a very specific project
maybe maybe

8202
03:57:40,370 --> 03:57:40,380
maybe maybe
 

8203
03:57:40,380 --> 03:57:42,710
maybe maybe
they could allow it I don't know I'll

8204
03:57:42,710 --> 03:57:42,720
they could allow it I don't know I'll
 

8205
03:57:42,720 --> 03:57:46,910
they could allow it I don't know I'll
check if I don't forget about it

8206
03:57:46,910 --> 03:57:46,920

 

8207
03:57:46,920 --> 03:57:48,410

I should write it down though because

8208
03:57:48,410 --> 03:57:48,420
I should write it down though because
 

8209
03:57:48,420 --> 03:57:49,849
I should write it down though because
otherwise I will forget about it let's
