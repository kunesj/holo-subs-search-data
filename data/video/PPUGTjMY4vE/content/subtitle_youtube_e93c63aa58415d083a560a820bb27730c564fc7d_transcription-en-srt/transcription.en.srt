3519
01:37:21,420 --> 01:37:23,390

also we need to find the next spot where

3520
01:37:23,390 --> 01:37:23,400
also we need to find the next spot where
 

3521
01:37:23,400 --> 01:37:25,129
also we need to find the next spot where
we can open something with the key

3522
01:37:25,129 --> 01:37:25,139
we can open something with the key
 

3523
01:37:25,139 --> 01:37:27,050
we can open something with the key
unless there is no more and I can bring

3524
01:37:27,050 --> 01:37:27,060
unless there is no more and I can bring
 

3525
01:37:27,060 --> 01:37:28,010
unless there is no more and I can bring
it to

3526
01:37:28,010 --> 01:37:28,020
it to
 

3527
01:37:28,020 --> 01:37:29,930
it to
maybe that's why I didn't find the key

3528
01:37:29,930 --> 01:37:29,940
maybe that's why I didn't find the key
 

3529
01:37:29,940 --> 01:37:31,610
maybe that's why I didn't find the key
in the other world

3530
01:37:31,610 --> 01:37:31,620
in the other world
 

3531
01:37:31,620 --> 01:37:34,070

they want me to come back
 

3533
01:37:34,080 --> 01:37:36,169
they want me to come back
because there was no key to find in the

3534
01:37:36,169 --> 01:37:36,179
because there was no key to find in the
 

3535
01:37:36,179 --> 01:37:39,110
because there was no key to find in the

even then

9072
04:01:19,189 --> 04:01:19,199

04:01:21,349 --> 04:01:21,359
I know the snacks were not so special
 

9075
04:01:21,359 --> 04:01:23,030
I know the snacks were not so special
actually there were less snacks than

9076
04:01:23,030 --> 04:01:23,040
actually there were less snacks than
 

9077
04:01:23,040 --> 04:01:25,969
actually there were less snacks than
usual but they were much bigger than

9078
04:01:25,969 --> 04:01:25,979
usual but they were much bigger than
 

9079

9982
04:27:37,429 --> 04:27:37,439
oh wait what where's the cross
 

9983
04:27:37,439 --> 04:27:40,010
oh wait what where's the cross
there's like a space for it they pick it

there's like a space for it they pick it

9987
04:27:43,260 --> 04:27:47,590

and we have a cross and uh

9988
04:27:47,590 --> 04:27:47,600

9989
04:27:47,600 --> 04:27:51,229

oh and a pot to connect oh okay okay
 

9991
04:27:51,239 --> 04:27:53,990
oh and a pot to connect oh okay okay
that's why it's like smaller the pot

9992

04:29:51,300 --> 04:29:53,450
let's start it's gonna like interrupt
each other again probably

10058
04:29:53,450 --> 04:29:53,460
each other again probably
 

10059
04:29:53,460 --> 04:29:57,590

04:30:04,490 --> 04:30:04,500
so let's say we put this one here
 

10065
04:30:04,500 --> 04:30:07,189
so let's say we put this one here
and then we put

and then we put
 

10067
04:30:07,199 --> 04:30:09,769
and then we put
example this one here and I would only

10068
04:30:09,769 --> 04:30:09,779
example this one here and I would only
 

10069
04:30:09,779 --> 04:30:11,210
example this one here and I would only
be missing

10070

but I don't know if overall this is the

10076
04:30:18,410 --> 04:30:18,420
but I don't know if overall this is the
 

10077
04:30:18,420 --> 04:30:25,429
but I don't know if overall this is the
way to go anyway

use that one to block something or maybe

10088
04:30:51,530 --> 04:30:51,540
use that one to block something or maybe
 

10089
04:30:51,540 --> 04:30:55,620
use that one to block something or maybe
again this one first actually hmm
