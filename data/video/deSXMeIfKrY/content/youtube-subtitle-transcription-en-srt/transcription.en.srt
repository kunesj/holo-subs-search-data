05:24:41,510 --> 05:24:41,520

 

8497
05:24:41,520 --> 05:24:42,708

so

8498
05:24:42,708 --> 05:24:42,718
so
 

8499
05:24:42,718 --> 05:24:46,948
so
i am confused

8500
05:24:46,948 --> 05:24:46,958

 

8501
05:24:46,958 --> 05:24:49,350

um

8502
05:24:49,350 --> 05:24:49,360

 

8503
05:24:49,360 --> 05:24:51,350

that's so weird because i uh in the

8504
05:24:51,350 --> 05:24:51,360
that's so weird because i uh in the
 

8505
05:24:51,360 --> 05:24:53,430
that's so weird because i uh in the
tracking number it said the last name

8506
05:24:53,430 --> 05:24:53,440
tracking number it said the last name
 

8507
05:24:53,440 --> 05:24:57,590
tracking number it said the last name
and the room number the apartment number

8508
05:24:57,590 --> 05:24:57,600
and the room number the apartment number
 

8509
05:24:57,600 --> 05:25:01,430
and the room number the apartment number
from the neighbor who supposedly has it

8510
05:25:01,430 --> 05:25:01,440
from the neighbor who supposedly has it
 

8511
05:25:01,440 --> 05:25:03,990
from the neighbor who supposedly has it
so i don't think there's a mistake there

8512
05:25:03,990 --> 05:25:04,000
so i don't think there's a mistake there
 

8513
05:25:04,000 --> 05:25:06,708
so i don't think there's a mistake there
both the number the room number and the

8514
05:25:06,708 --> 05:25:06,718
both the number the room number and the
 

8515
05:25:06,718 --> 05:25:10,470
both the number the room number and the
name is correct

8516
05:25:10,470 --> 05:25:10,480

 

8517
05:25:10,480 --> 05:25:12,788

yeah maybe my snacks got eaten but why

8518
05:25:12,788 --> 05:25:12,798
yeah maybe my snacks got eaten but why
 

8519
05:25:12,798 --> 05:25:14,548
yeah maybe my snacks got eaten but why
would you no i don't think they would do

8520
05:25:14,548 --> 05:25:14,558

8521
05:25:14,558 --> 05:25:16,230
would you no i don't think they would do
that

8522
05:25:16,230 --> 05:25:16,240
that
 

8523
05:25:16,240 --> 05:25:18,628
that
i don't think they would do that

8524
05:25:18,628 --> 05:25:18,638
i don't think they would do that
 

8525
05:25:18,638 --> 05:25:20,708
i don't think they would do that
um

8526
05:25:20,708 --> 05:25:20,718
um
 

8527
05:25:20,718 --> 05:25:22,548
um
in any case

8528
05:25:22,548 --> 05:25:22,558
in any case
 

8529
05:25:22,558 --> 05:25:24,310
in any case
um i was thinking

8530
05:25:24,310 --> 05:25:24,320
um i was thinking
 

8531
05:25:24,320 --> 05:25:27,510
um i was thinking
worst case if the snack box really

05:25:27,510 --> 05:25:27,520
worst case if the snack box really
 

8533
05:25:27,520 --> 05:25:30,150
worst case if the snack box really

8536
05:25:31,030 --> 05:25:31,040

8537
05:25:31,040 --> 05:25:32,390
the

stream instead that i wanted to do
um

8542
05:25:38,948 --> 05:25:38,958

inside from the outside it's just a
 

8617
05:27:07,280 --> 05:27:09,430
inside from the outside it's just a
snack box

8618
05:27:09,430 --> 05:27:09,440

05:27:11,830 --> 05:27:11,840
there is no worth in
 

8621
05:27:11,840 --> 05:27:15,110
there is no worth in
stealing that

8622
05:27:15,110 --> 05:27:15,120
stealing that
 

8623
05:27:15,120 --> 05:27:19,990
stealing that
i don't believe that

8624
05:27:19,990 --> 05:27:20,000

 

8625
05:27:20,000 --> 05:27:23,110

and especially if they signed their name

8626
05:27:23,110 --> 05:27:23,120
and especially if they signed their name
 

8627
05:27:23,120 --> 05:27:25,590
and especially if they signed their name
with the delivery guy otherwise the

8628
05:27:25,590 --> 05:27:25,600
with the delivery guy otherwise the
 

8629
05:27:25,600 --> 05:27:27,430
with the delivery guy otherwise the
delivery guy wouldn't have the name and

8630
05:27:27,430 --> 05:27:27,440
delivery guy wouldn't have the name and
 

8631
05:27:27,440 --> 05:27:30,628
delivery guy wouldn't have the name and
the apartment number if they signed that

8632
05:27:30,628 --> 05:27:30,638
the apartment number if they signed that
 

8633
05:27:30,638 --> 05:27:31,510
the apartment number if they signed that
then

8634
05:27:31,510 --> 05:27:31,520
then
 

8635
05:27:31,520 --> 05:27:33,510
then
it makes no sense that they would steal

8636
05:27:33,510 --> 05:27:33,520
it makes no sense that they would steal
 

8637
05:27:33,520 --> 05:27:34,390
it makes no sense that they would steal
it

8638
05:27:34,390 --> 05:27:34,400
it
 

8639
05:27:34,400 --> 05:27:36,070
it
maybe they lived with someone else and

8640
05:27:36,070 --> 05:27:36,080
maybe they lived with someone else and
 

8641
05:27:36,080 --> 05:27:38,548
maybe they lived with someone else and
they accepted it but then the person i

8642
05:27:38,548 --> 05:27:38,558
they accepted it but then the person i
 

8643
05:27:38,558 --> 05:27:40,548
they accepted it but then the person i
was in contact with didn't know about it

8644
05:27:40,548 --> 05:27:40,558
was in contact with didn't know about it
 

8645
05:27:40,558 --> 05:27:42,628
was in contact with didn't know about it
that's something that would make sense

8646
05:27:42,628 --> 05:27:42,638
that's something that would make sense
 

8647
05:27:42,638 --> 05:27:44,548
