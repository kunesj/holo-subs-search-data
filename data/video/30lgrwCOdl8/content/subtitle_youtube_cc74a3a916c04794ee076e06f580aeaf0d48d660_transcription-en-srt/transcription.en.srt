blanket
 

5123
02:25:37,220 --> 02:25:40,730
blanket
so I was thinking something that works

5124
02:25:40,730 --> 02:25:40,740
so I was thinking something that works
 

5125
02:25:40,740 --> 02:25:44,410
so I was thinking something that works
with with the towel and I'm thinking

5126
02:25:44,410 --> 02:25:44,420
with with the towel and I'm thinking
 

5127
02:25:44,420 --> 02:25:47,630

5129
02:25:47,640 --> 02:25:51,469

flip-flops work with a lot of sizes

5130
02:25:51,469 --> 02:25:51,479
flip-flops work with a lot of sizes
 

5131
02:25:51,479 --> 02:25:53,750
flip-flops work with a lot of sizes
um like as a one size but we I think we

5132
02:25:53,750 --> 02:25:53,760
um like as a one size but we I think we
 

5133
02:25:53,760 --> 02:25:55,429
um like as a one size but we I think we
would have to do at least two sizes like

5134
02:25:55,429 --> 02:25:55,439
would have to do at least two sizes like
 

5135
02:25:55,439 --> 02:25:59,389
would have to do at least two sizes like
one more like male big foot size and one

5136
02:25:59,389 --> 02:25:59,399
one more like male big foot size and one
 

5137
02:25:59,399 --> 02:26:02,389
one more like male big foot size and one
uh small lady size but I don't know if

5138
02:26:02,389 --> 02:26:02,399
uh small lady size but I don't know if
 

5139
02:26:02,399 --> 02:26:04,130
uh small lady size but I don't know if
that would be possible but besides that

5140
02:26:04,130 --> 02:26:04,140
that would be possible but besides that
 

5141
02:26:04,140 --> 02:26:05,510
that would be possible but besides that
yeah I was also thinking about a bag

5142
02:26:05,510 --> 02:26:05,520
yeah I was also thinking about a bag
 

5143
02:26:05,520 --> 02:26:08,150
yeah I was also thinking about a bag
like a beach bag like a big

5144
02:26:08,150 --> 02:26:08,160
like a beach bag like a big
 

5145
02:26:08,160 --> 02:26:10,130
like a beach bag like a big
um relatively big

you go to the beach I think that would

5150
02:26:14,330 --> 02:26:14,340

5151
02:26:14,340 --> 02:26:16,510

make a lot of sense

5152
02:26:16,510 --> 02:26:16,520
make a lot of sense
 

5153
02:26:16,520 --> 02:26:18,230
make a lot of sense
and

5154
02:26:18,230 --> 02:26:18,240

11127
05:02:41,580 --> 05:02:43,610

11128
05:02:43,610 --> 05:02:43,620
I mean even after that she continued
 

11129
05:02:43,620 --> 05:02:47,390
I mean even after that she continued
improving and building her studio so she

11130
05:02:47,390 --> 05:02:47,400
improving and building her studio so she
 

11131
05:02:47,400 --> 05:02:49,250
improving and building her studio so she
must have definitely

11132
05:02:49,250 --> 05:02:49,260

11133
05:02:49,260 --> 05:02:51,350

11135
05:02:51,360 --> 05:02:53,090
felt a big interest in it and I guess I
was basically like a testing object you

11136
05:02:53,090 --> 05:02:53,100
was basically like a testing object you
 

11137
05:02:53,100 --> 05:02:55,070
was basically like a testing object you
know

11138
05:02:55,070 --> 05:02:55,080
know
 

11139
05:02:55,080 --> 05:02:57,288
know
that she could try out all these things

11140
05:02:57,288 --> 05:02:57,298
that she could try out all these things
 

11141
05:02:57,298 --> 05:02:59,628
that she could try out all these things
and troubleshoot and all that get it to

11142
05:02:59,628 --> 05:02:59,638
and troubleshoot and all that get it to
 

11143
05:02:59,638 --> 05:03:00,708
and troubleshoot and all that get it to
a certain point because I think it would

11144
05:03:00,708 --> 05:03:00,718
a certain point because I think it would
 

11145
05:03:00,718 --> 05:03:02,570
a certain point because I think it would
have been more difficult if she would

11146
05:03:02,570 --> 05:03:02,580
have been more difficult if she would
 

11147
05:03:02,580 --> 05:03:04,490
have been more difficult if she would
have started setting up all of that on

11148
05:03:04,490 --> 05:03:04,500
have started setting up all of that on
 

11149
05:03:04,500 --> 05:03:05,690
have started setting up all of that on
her own

11150
05:03:05,690 --> 05:03:05,700
her own
 

11151
05:03:05,700 --> 05:03:07,670
her own
if she wants her own testing object but

11152
05:03:07,670 --> 05:03:07,680
if she wants her own testing object but
 

11153
05:03:07,680 --> 05:03:09,470
if she wants her own testing object but
also the tester you know

11154
05:03:09,470 --> 05:03:09,480
also the tester you know
 

11155
05:03:09,480 --> 05:03:11,448
also the tester you know
I think I would have made everything a

11156
05:03:11,448 --> 05:03:11,458
I think I would have made everything a
 

11157
05:03:11,458 --> 05:03:14,770
I think I would have made everything a
lot more difficult and a lot more slower

08:45:25,200 --> 08:45:29,990
there could be accidents but the place
where or the streets where he stood to

18898
08:45:29,990 --> 08:45:30,000
where or the streets where he stood to
 

18899
08:45:30,000 --> 08:45:32,150
where or the streets where he stood to
open up for me was

18900
08:45:32,150 --> 08:45:32,160
open up for me was
 

18901
08:45:32,160 --> 08:45:34,430
open up for me was
a quiet

18902
08:45:34,430 --> 08:45:34,440
a quiet
 

18903
08:45:34,440 --> 08:45:37,368
a quiet
Street which may have even been a

18904
08:45:37,368 --> 08:45:37,378
Street which may have even been a
 

18905
08:45:37,378 --> 08:45:40,368
Street which may have even been a
one-way street I'm not sure

18906
08:45:40,368 --> 08:45:40,378
one-way street I'm not sure
 

18907
08:45:40,378 --> 08:45:42,888
one-way street I'm not sure
and that's why

18908
08:45:42,888 --> 08:45:42,898
and that's why
 

18909
08:45:42,898 --> 08:45:44,330
and that's why
you know they drive on the left side

18910
08:45:44,330 --> 08:45:44,340
you know they drive on the left side
 

18911
08:45:44,340 --> 08:45:47,270
you know they drive on the left side
normally right but I guess

18912
08:45:47,270 --> 08:45:47,280
normally right but I guess
 

18913
08:45:47,280 --> 08:45:50,330
normally right but I guess
in this case he was

18914
08:45:50,330 --> 08:45:50,340
in this case he was
 

18915
08:45:50,340 --> 08:45:54,110
in this case he was
a parking on the right side of the

18916
08:45:54,110 --> 08:45:54,120
a parking on the right side of the
 

18917
08:45:54,120 --> 08:45:56,510
a parking on the right side of the
street which must mean it was a one-way

18918
08:45:56,510 --> 08:45:56,520
street which must mean it was a one-way
 

18919
08:45:56,520 --> 08:46:00,110
street which must mean it was a one-way
street right

18920
08:46:00,110 --> 08:46:00,120

 

18921
08:46:00,120 --> 08:46:02,388

right is that what that means trying to

18922
08:46:02,388 --> 08:46:02,398
right is that what that means trying to
 

18923
08:46:02,398 --> 08:46:04,910
right is that what that means trying to
figure out traffic without having a

18924
08:46:04,910 --> 08:46:04,920
figure out traffic without having a
 

18925
08:46:04,920 --> 08:46:07,128
figure out traffic without having a
license that must have been what that

18926
08:46:07,128 --> 08:46:07,138
license that must have been what that
 

18927
08:46:07,138 --> 08:46:09,288
license that must have been what that
meant yeah yeah so which means in this

18928
08:46:09,288 --> 08:46:09,298
meant yeah yeah so which means in this
 

18929
08:46:09,298 --> 08:46:11,868
meant yeah yeah so which means in this
case I don't really think that they

18930
08:46:11,868 --> 08:46:11,878
case I don't really think that they
 

18931
08:46:11,878 --> 08:46:13,128
case I don't really think that they
would have been danger but it's just

18932
08:46:13,128 --> 08:46:13,138
would have been danger but it's just
 

18933
08:46:13,138 --> 08:46:15,048
would have been danger but it's just
like by default they either don't do it

18934
08:46:15,048 --> 08:46:15,058
like by default they either don't do it
 

18935
08:46:15,058 --> 08:46:16,610
like by default they either don't do it
or they can't do it

18936
08:46:16,610 --> 08:46:16,620

18967
08:46:59,638 --> 08:47:01,968
sidewalk in this case
most of the times it would be the left

18968
