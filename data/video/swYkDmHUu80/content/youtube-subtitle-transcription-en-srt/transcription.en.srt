3803
01:56:33,079 --> 01:56:35,149
can right now it's just difficult
because I'm releasing so many little

3804
01:56:35,149 --> 01:56:35,159
because I'm releasing so many little
 

3805
01:56:35,159 --> 01:56:38,149
because I'm releasing so many little
videos one after another because of the

3806
01:56:38,149 --> 01:56:38,159
videos one after another because of the
 

3807
01:56:38,159 --> 01:56:39,669
videos one after another because of the
promotion

3808
01:56:39,669 --> 01:56:39,679
promotion
 

3809
01:56:39,679 --> 01:56:41,589
promotion
period of

3810
01:56:41,589 --> 01:56:41,599
period of
 

3811
01:56:41,599 --> 01:56:44,910
period of
POV but after I'm done with promoting my

3812
01:56:44,910 --> 01:56:44,920
POV but after I'm done with promoting my
 

3813
01:56:44,920 --> 01:56:47,750
POV but after I'm done with promoting my
album then it's just a single every once

3814
01:56:47,750 --> 01:56:47,760
album then it's just a single every once
 

3815
01:56:47,760 --> 01:56:50,669
album then it's just a single every once
in a while so I guess

3816
01:56:50,669 --> 01:56:50,679
in a while so I guess
 

3817
01:56:50,679 --> 01:56:53,189
in a while so I guess
probably budget wise it shouldn't be

3818
01:56:53,189 --> 01:56:53,199
probably budget wise it shouldn't be
 

3819
01:56:53,199 --> 01:56:57,589
probably budget wise it shouldn't be
such a big issue

3820
01:56:57,589 --> 01:56:57,599
such a big issue
 

3821
01:56:57,599 --> 01:57:00,229
such a big issue
anymore
