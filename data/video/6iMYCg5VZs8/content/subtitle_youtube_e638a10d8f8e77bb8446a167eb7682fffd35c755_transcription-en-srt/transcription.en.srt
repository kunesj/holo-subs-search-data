maybe at the end uh

1558
00:44:07,609 --> 00:44:07,619
maybe at the end uh
 

1559
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:10,970
maybe at the end uh
uh okay this is activated again our flow

1560
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:10,980
uh okay this is activated again our flow
 

1561
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:12,050
uh okay this is activated again our flow
is

1562
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:12,060
is
 

1563
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:15,109
is
starting again

1564
00:44:15,109 --> 00:44:15,119

 

1565
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,450

um

1566
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:16,460
um
 

1567
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:19,490
um
they will come back here

1568
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:19,500
they will come back here
 

1569
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:22,360

uh and do a long jump here and then

1574
00:44:26,569 --> 00:44:26,579
uh and do a long jump here and then
 

1575
00:44:26,579 --> 00:44:34,130
uh and do a long jump here and then
they're looping but

1576
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:34,140

 

1577
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:37,250

it

1578
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:37,260

 

1579
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:40,670

but but but

1580
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:40,680

 

1581
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:44,750

do I just then eventually at some point

1582
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:44,760
do I just then eventually at some point
 

1583
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,609
do I just then eventually at some point
give up the loop

1584
00:44:46,609 --> 00:44:46,619
give up the loop
 

1585
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:48,710
give up the loop
and change it because as long as they're

1586
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:48,720
and change it because as long as they're
 

1587
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,950
and change it because as long as they're
looping for a little while these these

1588
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:51,960
looping for a little while these these
 

1589
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:55,730
looping for a little while these these
uh walls will stay up right so we could

1590
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:55,740
uh walls will stay up right so we could
 

1591
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:58,190
uh walls will stay up right so we could
potentially

1592
00:44:58,190 --> 00:44:58,200
potentially
 

1593
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,849
potentially
go this way straight now

1594
00:45:00,849 --> 00:45:00,859
go this way straight now
 

1595
00:45:00,859 --> 00:45:05,569
go this way straight now
do a long jump here I think

1596
00:45:05,569 --> 00:45:05,579
do a long jump here I think
 

1597
00:45:05,579 --> 00:45:08,770
do a long jump here I think
wait what what what

1598
00:45:08,770 --> 00:45:08,780
wait what what what
 

1599
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:12,530
wait what what what
oh which seems enough but no we gotta do

1600
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:12,540
oh which seems enough but no we gotta do
 

1601
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:14,150
oh which seems enough but no we gotta do
the long jump earlier so that they pick

1602
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:14,160
the long jump earlier so that they pick
 

1603
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:28,670
the long jump earlier so that they pick
him up but it's kind of hot yep

1604
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:28,680

 

1605
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:34,809

okay we shall retry

1606
00:45:34,809 --> 00:45:34,819

00:45:57,370 --> 00:45:57,380
pick no wait
 

1621
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:01,430
pick no wait
uh first of all

1622
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:01,440

 

1623
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,790

uh why don't we just um send it like

1624
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:04,800
uh why don't we just um send it like
 

1625
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,970
uh why don't we just um send it like
this straight away why did I go down

1626
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:07,980
this straight away why did I go down
 

1627
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:10,910
this straight away why did I go down
right up and just go right right

1628
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:10,920
right up and just go right right
 

1629
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,650
right up and just go right right
this way

1630
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:12,660
this way
 

1631
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:16,010

and then this goes here thank you

1632
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:16,020
and then this goes here thank you
 

1633
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:20,170
and then this goes here thank you
for the minutes thank you wow I think

1634
00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:20,180

 

1635
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:23,390

first let's just create the path again

1636
00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:23,400
first let's just create the path again
 

1637
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:27,430
first let's just create the path again
okay for safety

1638
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:27,440

 

1639
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:32,569

uh this was fine

1640
00:46:32,569 --> 00:46:32,579

 

1641
00:46:32,579 --> 00:46:35,510

Liz comes back okay

1642
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:35,520
Liz comes back okay
 

1643
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:40,690
Liz comes back okay
okay

1644
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:40,700

 

1645
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:43,250

and now

1646
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:43,260
and now
 

1647
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:45,710
and now
now this would be looping

1648
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:45,720
now this would be looping
 

1649
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:48,470
now this would be looping
which is good we'll we would just I

1650
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:48,480
which is good we'll we would just I
 

1651
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,230
which is good we'll we would just I
would assume Loop it for a while show me

1652
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:51,240
would assume Loop it for a while show me
 

1653
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:54,770
would assume Loop it for a while show me
just before I do this one let's do the

1654
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:54,780
just before I do this one let's do the
 

1655
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:56,450
just before I do this one let's do the
other one first because that one makes

1656
00:46:56,450 --> 00:46:56,460
other one first because that one makes
 

1657
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:58,849
other one first because that one makes
sense to me no nah

1658
00:46:58,849 --> 00:46:58,859
sense to me no nah
 

1659
00:46:58,859 --> 00:47:02,329
sense to me no nah
if I just now create a group of people

1660
00:47:02,329 --> 00:47:02,339
if I just now create a group of people
 

1661
00:47:02,339 --> 00:47:06,650
if I just now create a group of people
that goes left up right and this way

1662
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:06,660
that goes left up right and this way
 

1663
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:13,849
that goes left up right and this way
then I see no issue

1664
00:47:13,849 --> 00:47:13,859

 

1665
00:47:13,859 --> 00:47:22,250

I should have sent them
 

1703
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:17,569
I should have sent them
straight up

1704
00:48:17,569 --> 00:48:17,579

 

1705
00:48:17,579 --> 00:48:21,950

1713
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:36,050

yeah but okay uh why do I do it while

1714
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:36,060
yeah but okay uh why do I do it while
 

1715
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:39,410
yeah but okay uh why do I do it while
they're doing that uh here that jump

1716
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:39,420
they're doing that uh here that jump
 

1717
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:42,170
they're doing that uh here that jump
wasn't that too

1718
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:42,180
wasn't that too
 

1719
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:44,930
wasn't that too
two why is that here

1720
00:48:44,930 --> 00:48:44,940
two why is that here
 

1721
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:47,270
two why is that here
but the most recent command stained

1722
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:47,280
but the most recent command stained
 

1723
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,470
but the most recent command stained
right so this should have worked

1724
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:48,480
right so this should have worked
 

1725
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:53,510
right so this should have worked
apparently

1726
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:53,520

 

1727
00:48:53,520 --> 00:49:00,410

that jump was on point okay ah

1728
00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:00,420

 

1729
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:02,450

01:20:54,540 --> 01:20:56,750
thank you forever hey I can meet jump
why can't you make the jump then

2940
01:20:56,750 --> 01:20:56,760
why can't you make the jump then
 

2941
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:57,649
why can't you make the jump then
um

2942
01:20:57,649 --> 01:20:57,659
um
 

2943
01:20:57,659 --> 01:21:00,110
um
I'm gonna I'm gonna Loop some

2944
01:21:00,110 --> 01:21:00,120
I'm gonna I'm gonna Loop some
 

2945
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:03,110
I'm gonna I'm gonna Loop some
people after all

2946
01:21:03,110 --> 01:21:03,120
people after all
 

2947
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:05,770
people after all
is that enough people

2948
01:21:05,770 --> 01:21:05,780
is that enough people
 

2949
01:21:05,780 --> 01:21:08,390
is that enough people
should be okay

2950
01:21:08,390 --> 01:21:08,400
should be okay
 

2951
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:12,590
should be okay
and then

2952
01:21:12,590 --> 01:21:12,600

 

2953
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:15,649

uh
 

2957
01:21:18,179 --> 01:21:22,729
uh
we'll need a loop on on every

2958
01:21:22,729 --> 01:21:22,739
we'll need a loop on on every
 

2959
01:21:22,739 --> 01:21:24,950
we'll need a loop on on every
of these platforms

2960
01:21:24,950 --> 01:21:24,960
of these platforms
 

2961
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:28,790
of these platforms
for safety let me add

2962
01:21:28,790 --> 01:21:28,800
for safety let me add
 

2963
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:32,880
for safety let me add
God's sake

2964
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:32,890

 

2965
01:21:32,890 --> 01:21:35,530

[Music]
 

2967
01:21:35,540 --> 01:21:40,630
[Music]
oh it's back

2968
01:21:40,630 --> 01:21:40,640

 

2969
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:42,470

hey
 

2971
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:44,330
hey
why is it why is that why is there not

2972
01:21:44,330 --> 01:21:44,340
why is it why is that why is there not
 

2973
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:49,910
why is it why is that why is there not
enough people coming back to me

2974
01:21:49,910 --> 01:21:49,920

 

2975
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:52,910

well these same people these people on

2976
01:21:52,910 --> 01:21:52,920
well these same people these people on
 

2977
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:54,530
well these same people these people on
that platform okay like we don't need

2978
01:21:54,530 --> 01:21:54,540
that platform okay like we don't need
 

2979
01:21:54,540 --> 01:21:55,970
that platform okay like we don't need
any more people it's a perfect amount no

2980
01:21:55,970 --> 01:21:55,980
any more people it's a perfect amount no
 

2981
01:21:55,980 --> 01:21:58,430
any more people it's a perfect amount no
one's falling off

2982
01:21:58,430 --> 01:21:58,440
one's falling off
 

2983
01:21:58,440 --> 01:21:59,930
one's falling off
um

2984
01:21:59,930 --> 01:21:59,940
um
 

2985
01:21:59,940 --> 01:22:02,930
um
the white it seems pretty stable now

2986
01:22:02,930 --> 01:22:02,940
the white it seems pretty stable now
 

2987
01:22:02,940 --> 01:22:04,729
the white it seems pretty stable now
but yeah I didn't make this this Loop

2988
01:22:04,729 --> 01:22:04,739
but yeah I didn't make this this Loop
 

2989
01:22:04,739 --> 01:22:07,430
but yeah I didn't make this this Loop
yet

2990
01:22:07,430 --> 01:22:07,440

 

2991
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:09,470

um but I don't think we need it

2992
01:22:09,470 --> 01:22:09,480
um but I don't think we need it
 

2993
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:11,630
um but I don't think we need it
do we or maybe we do

2994
01:22:11,630 --> 01:22:11,640
do we or maybe we do
 

2995
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:14,209
do we or maybe we do
maybe we do oh God okay

01:22:14,219 --> 01:22:19,490
maybe we do oh God okay
um

2998
01:22:19,490 --> 01:22:19,500

 

2999
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:22,010

looping oh that's a lot of people over

3000
01:22:22,010 --> 01:22:22,020
looping oh that's a lot of people over
 

3001
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:24,709
looping oh that's a lot of people over
there wow

3002
01:22:24,709 --> 01:22:24,719
there wow
 

3003
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:28,250
there wow
okay and now

3004
01:22:28,250 --> 01:22:28,260
okay and now
 

3005
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:30,850
okay and now
now now now

3006
01:22:30,850 --> 01:22:30,860
now now now
 

3007
01:22:30,860 --> 01:22:34,370
now now now
what now now we send

3008
01:22:34,370 --> 01:22:34,380
what now now we send
 

3009
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:37,430
what now now we send
it through here right

3010
01:22:37,430 --> 01:22:37,440
it through here right
 

3011
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:39,770
it through here right
uh

3012
01:22:39,770 --> 01:22:39,780

 

3013
01:22:39,780 --> 01:22:43,370

big brain kiwawa oh but how do we ah

3014
01:22:43,370 --> 01:22:43,380
big brain kiwawa oh but how do we ah
 

3015
01:22:43,380 --> 01:22:46,510
big brain kiwawa oh but how do we ah
they gotta go straight

3016
01:22:46,510 --> 01:22:46,520

 

3017
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:48,290

but wait

3018
01:22:48,290 --> 01:22:48,300
but wait
 

3019
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:50,090
but wait
how did they make that jump is that a

3020
01:22:50,090 --> 01:22:50,100
how did they make that jump is that a
 

3021
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:52,070
how did they make that jump is that a
jump they can make when when the wind

3022
01:22:52,070 --> 01:22:52,080
jump they can make when when the wind
 

3023
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:54,709
jump they can make when when the wind
comes first and then no platform I think

3024
01:22:54,709 --> 01:22:54,719
comes first and then no platform I think
 

3025
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:58,070
comes first and then no platform I think
they can make the jump or no it has to

3026
01:22:58,070 --> 01:22:58,080
they can make the jump or no it has to
 

3027
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:00,229
they can make the jump or no it has to
be it has to be like that

3028
01:23:00,229 --> 01:23:00,239
be it has to be like that
 

3029
01:23:00,239 --> 01:23:01,970
be it has to be like that
right

3030
01:23:01,970 --> 01:23:01,980
right
 

3031
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:05,510
right
probably

3032
01:23:05,510 --> 01:23:05,520

 

3033
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:08,090

I believe

3034
01:23:08,090 --> 01:23:08,100
I believe
 

3035
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:12,110
I believe
wait there's no way

3036
01:23:12,110 --> 01:23:12,120

 

3037
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:19,910

wiggle oh

3038
01:23:19,910 --> 01:23:19,920

 

3039
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:24,950

what about the other one

3040
01:23:24,950 --> 01:23:24,960

 

3041
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:26,810

oh that was close though what about the

3042
01:23:26,810 --> 01:23:26,820
oh that was close though what about the
 

3043
01:23:26,820 --> 01:23:28,850
oh that was close though what about the
other one

3044
01:23:28,850 --> 01:23:28,860
other one
 

3045
01:23:28,860 --> 01:23:31,610
other one
I mean they can't make that jump from

3046
01:23:31,610 --> 01:23:31,620
I mean they can't make that jump from
 

3047
01:23:31,620 --> 01:23:39,850
I mean they can't make that jump from
experience

3048
01:23:39,850 --> 01:23:39,860

 

3049
01:23:39,860 --> 01:23:43,250

what what up

3050
01:23:43,250 --> 01:23:43,260
what what up
 

3051
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:46,130
what what up
oh

3052
01:23:46,130 --> 01:23:46,140

 

3053
01:23:46,140 --> 01:23:47,450

um

3054
01:23:47,450 --> 01:23:47,460
um
 

3055
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:49,189
um
well let's test it out then because

3056
01:23:49,189 --> 01:23:49,199
well let's test it out then because
 

3057
01:23:49,199 --> 01:23:50,870
well let's test it out then because
we've already lost

3058
01:23:50,870 --> 01:23:50,880
we've already lost
 

3059
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:53,590
we've already lost
um

3060
01:23:53,590 --> 01:23:53,600

 

3061
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:57,530

what if

3062
01:23:57,530 --> 01:23:57,540

 

3063
01:23:57,540 --> 01:23:59,270

I send

3064
01:23:59,270 --> 01:23:59,280
I send
 

3065
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:02,709
I send
some

3066
01:24:02,709 --> 01:24:02,719

 

3067
01:24:02,719 --> 01:24:05,870

3068
01:24:05,870 --> 01:24:05,880
straight over to this side

01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:09,169
straight over to this side
R.I.P I tried see they can't dump these

3070
01:24:09,169 --> 01:24:09,179
R.I.P I tried see they can't dump these
 

3071
01:24:09,179 --> 01:24:10,970
R.I.P I tried see they can't dump these
idiots

3072

the wind has to be first
 

3079
01:24:18,179 --> 01:24:22,669
the wind has to be first
so

3080
01:24:22,669 --> 01:24:22,679

 

3081
01:24:22,679 --> 01:24:26,689

the wind has to be first

3083
01:24:26,699 --> 01:24:29,209

wait can I

3084
01:24:29,209 --> 01:24:29,219
wait can I
 

3085
01:24:29,219 --> 01:24:35,510
wait can I
no I can't turn on the Wind platforms

3086
01:24:35,510 --> 01:24:35,520

 

3087
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:38,209

well if I send them back

3088
01:24:38,209 --> 01:24:38,219
well if I send them back
 

3089
01:24:38,219 --> 01:24:42,169
well if I send them back
after the golden guy was retrieved

3090
01:24:42,169 --> 01:24:42,179
after the golden guy was retrieved
 

3091
01:24:42,179 --> 01:24:46,910
after the golden guy was retrieved
and we're done here

3092
01:24:46,910 --> 01:24:46,920

 

3093
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:50,090

they he they have to go straight at the

3094
01:24:50,090 --> 01:24:50,100
they he they have to go straight at the
 

3095
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:51,590
they he they have to go straight at the
point

3096
01:24:51,590 --> 01:24:51,600
point
 

3097
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:55,130
point
but you know what I have to do

3098
01:24:55,130 --> 01:24:55,140
but you know what I have to do
 

3099
01:24:55,140 --> 01:24:57,709
but you know what I have to do
I would have to probably lead them one

3100
01:24:57,709 --> 01:24:57,719
I would have to probably lead them one
 

3101
01:24:57,719 --> 01:24:59,750
I would have to probably lead them one
level lower

3102
01:24:59,750 --> 01:24:59,760
level lower
 

3103
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:02,030
level lower
so that they don't make too much of a

3104
01:25:02,030 --> 01:25:02,040
so that they don't make too much of a
 

3105
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:03,950
so that they don't make too much of a
mess you see it

3106
01:25:03,950 --> 01:25:03,960
mess you see it
 

3107
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:05,990
mess you see it
um

3108
01:25:05,990 --> 01:25:06,000
um
 

3109
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,090
um
turn the platform to stand and try to

3110
01:25:08,090 --> 01:25:08,100
turn the platform to stand and try to
 

3111
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:10,729
turn the platform to stand and try to
make them jump using a fan what what

3112
01:25:10,729 --> 01:25:10,739
make them jump using a fan what what
 

3113
01:25:10,739 --> 01:25:11,810
make them jump using a fan what what
what what what what what what what what

but one of the platform actually
 

3271
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:15,770
but one of the platform actually
accidentally gets activated before

3272
01:29:15,770 --> 01:29:15,780
accidentally gets activated before
 

3273
01:29:15,780 --> 01:29:25,610

01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:25,620

 

3275
01:29:25,620 --> 01:29:29,090

uh then let's jump over here and jump up
 

3287
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:47,590
uh then let's jump over here and jump up
over the platform when they arrive here

3288
01:29:47,590 --> 01:29:47,600

 

3289
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:56,510

and then that's done

3290
01:29:56,510 --> 01:29:56,520

 

3291
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:58,010

gold is probably gonna be the first one

3292
01:29:58,010 --> 01:29:58,020
gold is probably gonna be the first one
 

3293
01:29:58,020 --> 01:30:02,149
gold is probably gonna be the first one
to press the button I would hope so yeah

3294
01:30:02,149 --> 01:30:02,159
to press the button I would hope so yeah
 

3295
01:30:02,159 --> 01:30:04,010
to press the button I would hope so yeah
okay

3296
01:30:04,010 --> 01:30:04,020
okay
 

3297
01:30:04,020 --> 01:30:04,689
okay
um

3298
01:30:04,689 --> 01:30:04,699
um
 

3299
01:30:04,699 --> 01:30:09,350
um
are my loops okay do they need people no

3300
01:30:09,350 --> 01:30:09,360
are my loops okay do they need people no
 

3301
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:11,149
are my loops okay do they need people no
right uh so

3302
01:30:11,149 --> 01:30:11,159
right uh so
 

3303
01:30:11,159 --> 01:30:14,030
right uh so
so all I need to do is flick the switch

3304
01:30:14,030 --> 01:30:14,040
so all I need to do is flick the switch
 

3305
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:18,830
so all I need to do is flick the switch
to go right here I think

3306
01:30:18,830 --> 01:30:18,840

 

3307
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:21,890

um but I think it's uh wait now let's

3308
01:30:21,890 --> 01:30:21,900
um but I think it's uh wait now let's
 

3309
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:23,090
um but I think it's uh wait now let's
not start with that one let's start with

3310
01:30:23,090 --> 01:30:23,100
not start with that one let's start with
 

3311
01:30:23,100 --> 01:30:24,770
not start with that one let's start with
the other one right I should start with

3312
01:30:24,770 --> 01:30:24,780
the other one right I should start with
 

3313
01:30:24,780 --> 01:30:26,870
the other one right I should start with
the other one

3314
01:30:26,870 --> 01:30:26,880
the other one
 

3315
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:28,189
the other one
um

3316
01:30:28,189 --> 01:30:28,199
um
 

3317
01:30:28,199 --> 01:30:30,890
um
Let's uh let's just let's just uh in my

3318
01:30:30,890 --> 01:30:30,900
Let's uh let's just let's just uh in my
 

3319
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:33,830
Let's uh let's just let's just uh in my
head repeat it one more time uh I I I

3320
01:30:33,830 --> 01:30:33,840
head repeat it one more time uh I I I
 

3321

switch

3322
01:30:35,450 --> 01:30:35,460
switch
 

3323
01:30:35,460 --> 01:30:38,960
switch
so that they go right here

3324
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:38,970

3329
01:30:42,420 --> 01:30:45,169
and then
they pick him up they go up here they go

3330
01:30:45,169 --> 01:30:45,179
they pick him up they go up here they go
 

3331

here
 

3333
01:30:46,139 --> 01:30:49,790
here
and I'll do an upturn here yeah then

3334
01:30:49,790 --> 01:30:49,800
and I'll do an upturn here yeah then
 

3335
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:51,350

what do I do with them
 

3343
01:30:59,219 --> 01:31:03,410
what do I do with them
should I send them up

3344
01:31:03,410 --> 01:31:03,420

 

3345
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:08,330

what uh uh up up
 

3349
01:31:11,719 --> 01:31:16,189
what uh uh up up
and and maybe Loop them for a while

3350
01:31:16,189 --> 01:31:16,199
and and maybe Loop them for a while
 

3351
01:31:16,199 --> 01:31:20,209
and and maybe Loop them for a while
here maybe should we just uh loop them

3352
01:31:20,209 --> 01:31:20,219
here maybe should we just uh loop them
 

3353
01:31:20,219 --> 01:31:24,290
here maybe should we just uh loop them
I tapped out
