05:45:18,948 --> 05:45:18,958
it would take me
 

8550
05:45:18,958 --> 05:45:22,470
it would take me
a year

8551
05:45:22,470 --> 05:45:22,480
a year
 

8552
05:45:22,480 --> 05:45:24,390
a year
i have to consider that kind of stuff

8553
05:45:24,390 --> 05:45:24,400
i have to consider that kind of stuff
 

8554
05:45:24,400 --> 05:45:26,470
i have to consider that kind of stuff
and you know

8555
05:45:26,470 --> 05:45:26,480
and you know
 

8556
05:45:26,480 --> 05:45:27,750
and you know
the

8557
05:45:27,750 --> 05:45:27,760
the
 

8558
05:45:27,760 --> 05:45:28,708
the
you know

8559
05:45:28,708 --> 05:45:28,718
you know
 

8560
05:45:28,718 --> 05:45:30,948
you know
even with this i was playing it two

8561
05:45:30,948 --> 05:45:30,958
even with this i was playing it two
 

8562
05:45:30,958 --> 05:45:32,948
even with this i was playing it two
times a week

8563
05:45:32,948 --> 05:45:32,958
times a week
 

8564
05:45:32,958 --> 05:45:36,230
times a week
and six to eight hours

06:01:45,110 --> 06:01:45,120
because this really even though it's the
 

9076
06:01:45,120 --> 06:01:47,030
because this really even though it's the
beginning of the story it released after

9077
06:01:47,030 --> 06:01:47,040
beginning of the story it released after
 

9078
06:01:47,040 --> 06:01:48,868
beginning of the story it released after
a lot of other games and

9079
06:01:48,868 --> 06:01:48,878
a lot of other games and
 

9080
06:01:48,878 --> 06:01:51,430
a lot of other games and
i think it expects you to

i think it expects you to
 

9082
06:01:51,440 --> 06:01:53,910
i think it expects you to
i think the game expects a lot of

9083
06:01:53,910 --> 06:01:53,920
i think the game expects a lot of
 

9084
06:01:53,920 --> 06:01:56,868
i think the game expects a lot of
rather than a lot of newbies um a lot of

9085
06:01:56,868 --> 06:01:56,878
rather than a lot of newbies um a lot of
 

9086
06:01:56,878 --> 06:02:00,390
rather than a lot of newbies um a lot of
people who already know kitio to play

people who already know kitio to play
 

9088
06:02:00,400 --> 06:02:02,310
people who already know kitio to play
that game so
