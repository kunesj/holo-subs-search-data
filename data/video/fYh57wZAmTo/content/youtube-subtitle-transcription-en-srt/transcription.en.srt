uh i'll explain it briefly so pretty

596
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:47,200
uh i'll explain it briefly so pretty
 

597
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,710
uh i'll explain it briefly so pretty
much like uh

598
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:48,720
much like uh
 

599
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,190
much like uh
let's say hypothetically i'm on the left

600
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:51,200
let's say hypothetically i'm on the left
 

601
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,350
let's say hypothetically i'm on the left
side and kiara's on the right side

602
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:53,360
side and kiara's on the right side
 

603
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,950
side and kiara's on the right side
it would never be that way of course

604
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:56,960

 

605
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,150

what and uh

606
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:00,160
what and uh
 

607
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,950
what and uh
so the person who has uh whose turn it

608
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:02,960
so the person who has uh whose turn it
 

609
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,029
so the person who has uh whose turn it
is you want to go through all the rows

610
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:05,039
is you want to go through all the rows
 

611
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,350
is you want to go through all the rows
and you want to end up at your own goal

612
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:07,360
and you want to end up at your own goal
 

613
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,990
and you want to end up at your own goal
with as many of the marbles as possible

614
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:10,000
with as many of the marbles as possible
 

615
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,590
with as many of the marbles as possible
so like you have to calculate because

616
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:11,600
so like you have to calculate because
 

617
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,669
so like you have to calculate because
you have to pick up your your marbles as

618
00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:13,679
you have to pick up your your marbles as
 

619
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,549
you have to pick up your your marbles as
you go along

620
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:14,559
you go along
 

621
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,029
you go along
but you can also pick up some as you go

622
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:17,039
but you can also pick up some as you go
 

623
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:17,830
but you can also pick up some as you go
past

624
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:17,840
past
 

625
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,830
past
so you have to calculate it uh to make

626
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:19,840
so you have to calculate it uh to make
 

627
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,430
so you have to calculate it uh to make
sure you're you're

628
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:21,440
sure you're you're
 

629
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,590
sure you're you're
gaining instead of losing yeah

630
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:23,600
gaining instead of losing yeah
 

631
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,950
gaining instead of losing yeah
calculation is

632
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:24,960
calculation is
 

633
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,870

1347
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,750

so you can only move diagonally

1348
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:41,760
so you can only move diagonally
 

1349
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,750
so you can only move diagonally
unless there's a there's a catch

1350
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:45,760
unless there's a there's a catch
 

1351
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,790
unless there's a there's a catch
it is not if i can reach the other side

1352
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:48,800
it is not if i can reach the other side
 

1353
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,510
it is not if i can reach the other side
and get kingd

1354

and get kingd
 

1355
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,190
and get kingd
so if you reach the other side you win

1356
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:53,200
so if you reach the other side you win
 

1357
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,630
so if you reach the other side you win
uh no but then

yeah that's right oh
 

2457
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:37,110
yeah that's right oh
wait let me try to think of the

2458
01:08:37,110 --> 01:08:37,120
wait let me try to think of the
 

2459
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:39,349
wait let me try to think of the
possibility so if i go there

2460
01:08:39,349 --> 01:08:39,359
possibility so if i go there
 

2461
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:43,590
possibility so if i go there
the queen can go diagonal and straight

2462
01:08:43,590 --> 01:08:43,600
the queen can go diagonal and straight
 

2463
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:44,309
the queen can go diagonal and straight
right

2464
01:08:44,309 --> 01:08:44,319
right
 

2465
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:47,669
right
so you can the queen cannot hurt me

2466
01:08:47,669 --> 01:08:47,679
so you can the queen cannot hurt me
 

2467
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:51,030
so you can the queen cannot hurt me
and the king can only move one at a time

2468
01:08:51,030 --> 01:08:51,040
and the king can only move one at a time
 

2469
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:53,990
and the king can only move one at a time
so i'm still too far away from him but

2470
01:08:53,990 --> 01:08:54,000
so i'm still too far away from him but
 

2471
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,149
so i'm still too far away from him but
uh

2472
01:08:56,149 --> 01:08:56,159
uh
 

2473
01:08:56,159 --> 01:08:58,229
uh
he could if if you would want to move

2474
01:08:58,229 --> 01:08:58,239
he could if if you would want to move
 

2475
01:08:58,239 --> 01:08:59,189
he could if if you would want to move
the king from

2476
01:08:59,189 --> 01:08:59,199
the king from
 

2477
01:08:59,199 --> 01:09:02,309
the king from
there to get him to save space does the

2478
01:09:02,309 --> 01:09:02,319
there to get him to save space does the
 

2479
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:03,430
there to get him to save space does the
king

2480
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:03,440
king
 

2481
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:05,430
king
he even i don't know if he can only go

2482
01:09:05,430 --> 01:09:05,440
he even i don't know if he can only go
 

2483
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:07,110
he even i don't know if he can only go
straight or also diagonal but even if he

2484
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:07,120
straight or also diagonal but even if he
 

2485
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:07,590
straight or also diagonal but even if he
could

2486
01:09:07,590 --> 01:09:07,600
could
 

2487
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,189
could
go diagonal he would only have one

2488
01:09:09,189 --> 01:09:09,199
go diagonal he would only have one
 

2489
01:09:09,199 --> 01:09:12,470
go diagonal he would only have one
choice and that is going here

2490
01:09:12,470 --> 01:09:12,480
choice and that is going here
 

2491
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:14,470
choice and that is going here
