aha I create a room and then after H how

448
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:04,160
aha I create a room and then after H how
 

449
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,590
aha I create a room and then after H how
should we do it like after each creating

450
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:06,600
should we do it like after each creating
 

451
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,990
should we do it like after each creating
a new room after each mini game I don't

452
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:09,000
a new room after each mini game I don't
 

453
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,389
a new room after each mini game I don't
know how this works but I guess that's

454
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:10,399
know how this works but I guess that's
 

455
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,509
know how this works but I guess that's
how it works it would take a lot of time

456
00:13:12,509 --> 00:13:12,519
how it works it would take a lot of time
 

457
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:14,629
how it works it would take a lot of time
so maybe per room we can do two mini

458
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:14,639
so maybe per room we can do two mini
 

459
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,710
so maybe per room we can do two mini
games if that is possible and then make

460
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:16,720
games if that is possible and then make
 

461
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,430
