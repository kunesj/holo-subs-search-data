better way to kite them oh like for
example if I were to make a block they

1308
00:32:12,629 --> 00:32:12,639
example if I were to make a block they
 

1309
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,730
example if I were to make a block they
would have to destroy the block

1310
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:14,740
would have to destroy the block
 

1311
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:17,950
would have to destroy the block

00:32:25,669 --> 00:32:25,679

 

1317
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:28,110

lag there's lag right now I mean I did

1318
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:28,120
lag there's lag right now I mean I did
 

1319

send some
 

1321
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:33,190
send some
okay uh in the meantime I think

1322
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:33,200
okay uh in the meantime I think
 

1323
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:38,230
okay uh in the meantime I think
we Let's Go destroy

1324
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:38,240

1335
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,789
builder
huh you got B the Builder now you got

1336
00:32:50,789 --> 00:32:50,799
huh you got B the Builder now you got

Sharin the
Builder uh let's see I think if I press

1340
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:55,120
Builder uh let's see I think if I press
 

1341
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,909
Builder uh let's see I think if I press
was it R

1342
00:32:58,909 --> 00:32:58,919

 

1343
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:03,269

all right I guess uh I guess it doesn't

1344
00:33:03,269 --> 00:33:03,279
all right I guess uh I guess it doesn't
 

1345
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:07,509
all right I guess uh I guess it doesn't
really matter just stick with

1346
00:33:07,509 --> 00:33:07,519

 

1347
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,310

this oh they got holy crap they got

1348
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:10,320
this oh they got holy crap they got
 

1349
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,350
this oh they got holy crap they got
other shapes I didn't

1350
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:14,360
other shapes I didn't
 

1351
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:19,110
other shapes I didn't
realize destruction

1352
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:19,120

 

1353
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,830

construction I didn't know they had

1354
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:20,840
construction I didn't know they had
 

1355
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,029
construction I didn't know they had
other shapes well we're going to we're

1356
00:33:23,029 --> 00:33:23,039
other shapes well we're going to we're
 

1357
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,870
other shapes well we're going to we're
going to make it basic

1358
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:24,880
going to make it basic
 

1359
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:29,590
going to make it basic
though you do an inside corner or 3 four

1360
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:29,600
though you do an inside corner or 3 four
 

1361
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,629
though you do an inside corner or 3 four
why would you want to do a 3

1362
00:33:31,629 --> 00:33:31,639
why would you want to do a 3
 

1363
00:33:31,639 --> 00:33:34,669
why would you want to do a 3
four because it feels nicer does it

1364
00:33:34,669 --> 00:33:34,679
four because it feels nicer does it
 

1365
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:37,149
four because it feels nicer does it
matter I really don't think it matters

1366
00:33:37,149 --> 00:33:37,159
matter I really don't think it matters
 

1367
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:40,029
matter I really don't think it matters
though yeah I didn't expect that let's

1368
00:33:40,029 --> 00:33:40,039
though yeah I didn't expect that let's
 

1369
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:43,029
though yeah I didn't expect that let's
go

1370
00:33:43,029 --> 00:33:43,039

 

1371
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:47,110

basic and then we could probably change

1372
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:47,120
basic and then we could probably change
 

1373
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,669
basic and then we could probably change
this into something else honestly let's

1374
00:33:49,669 --> 00:33:49,679
this into something else honestly let's
 

1375
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:54,870
this into something else honestly let's
just destroy

1376
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:54,880

 

1377
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,310

this yeah I'm pretty sure you can shoot

1378
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:57,320
this yeah I'm pretty sure you can shoot
 

1379
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,310
this yeah I'm pretty sure you can shoot
through the hole

1380
00:33:59,310 --> 00:33:59,320
through the hole
 

1381
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:02,789
through the hole
H I think the host would be good for uh

1382
00:34:02,789 --> 00:34:02,799
H I think the host would be good for uh
 

1383
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,549
H I think the host would be good for uh
the second

1384
00:34:04,549 --> 00:34:04,559
the second
 

1385
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,190
the second
area I mean like higher up just a little

1386
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:07,200
area I mean like higher up just a little
 

1387
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,030
area I mean like higher up just a little
bit

1388
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:10,040
bit
 

1389
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:14,710
bit
Oh weird oh is this like why is it not

1390
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:14,720
Oh weird oh is this like why is it not
 

1391
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,550
Oh weird oh is this like why is it not
perfect uh let's change it to a

1392
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:16,560
perfect uh let's change it to a
 

1393
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,669
perfect uh let's change it to a
different shape it bugs me how about

1394
00:34:20,669 --> 00:34:20,679
different shape it bugs me how about
 

1395
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:22,470
different shape it bugs me how about
reforce

1396

it but it bugs
 

1405
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,109
it but it bugs
me is it the window in the top that

1406
00:34:39,109 --> 00:34:39,119
me is it the window in the top that
 

1407
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,389
me is it the window in the top that
makes it

1408
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:40,399
makes it
 

1409
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:43,030
makes it
weird well we just keep that

1410
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:43,040
weird well we just keep that
 

1411
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,629
weird well we just keep that
window hopefully hopefully they don't

1412
00:34:45,629 --> 00:34:45,639
window hopefully hopefully they don't
 

1413
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:48,629
window hopefully hopefully they don't
notice how weird it

1414
00:34:48,629 --> 00:34:48,639
notice how weird it
 

1415
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,790

is we'll keep that
window I think we should only focus on

1418
00:34:53,349 --> 00:34:53,359
window I think we should only focus on
 

1419
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,869
window I think we should only focus on
like the first layer I hope they can't

1420
00:34:55,869 --> 00:34:55,879
like the first layer I hope they can't
 

1421
00:34:55,879 --> 00:35:00,030
like the first layer I hope they can't
see through that

1422
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:00,040

 

1423
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,349

one here you could probably do it more

1432
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:15,800
one here you could probably do it more
 

1433
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,750
one here you could probably do it more
building

1434
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:18,760

 

1435
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:21,470

blocks there you

1436
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:21,480
blocks there you
 

1437
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,990
blocks there you
go I can't fix that well it's not too

going to go back to the old base

1442
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:32,880

 

1443
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,150

right uh let's go over
 

1447
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,710
right uh let's go over
here uh it's so this

1448
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:41,720
here uh it's so this
 

1449
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,390
here uh it's so this
way where is everyone like how far away

1450
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:44,400
way where is everyone like how far away
 

1451
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,829
way where is everyone like how far away
are they they're all the way over

are they they're all the way over
there I guess I guess the best method

1454
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:49,880
there I guess I guess the best method
 

1455
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:53,829
there I guess I guess the best method
for me is assuming I am even there for

1456
00:35:53,829 --> 00:35:53,839
for me is assuming I am even there for
 

1457
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:55,030
for me is assuming I am even there for
the third

1458
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:55,040
the third
 

1459
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,349
the third

I'll think about that in a bit uh let's

1810
00:43:59,630 --> 00:43:59,640
I'll think about that in a bit uh let's
 

1811
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,030
I'll think about that in a bit uh let's
actually do a favorite here and then

1812
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:02,040
actually do a favorite here and then

1816
00:44:09,349 --> 00:44:09,359

 

1817
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:11,309

later I don't know why I'm tracking that

1818
00:44:11,309 --> 00:44:11,319
later I don't know why I'm tracking that
 

1819
00:44:11,319 --> 00:44:13,710
later I don't know why I'm tracking that
I don't need to track

1820
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:13,720
I don't need to track
 

1821
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:16,109
I don't need to track
that all right I'm probably going to be

1822
00:44:16,109 --> 00:44:16,119
that all right I'm probably going to be
 

1823
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:17,510
that all right I'm probably going to be
the only one to focus on this at the

moment so I will do that to help them
 

1827
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,270

are still
 

1837
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,470

useful I thought that maybe by the third

1838
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:37,480
useful I thought that maybe by the third
 

1839
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:41,150

1845
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,990
craft in or a
automatic Harvester that's probably what

1846
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:48,000
automatic Harvester that's probably what
 

1847
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,630
automatic Harvester that's probably what
I

1848
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:51,640

 

1849
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:57,349

mean guess we'll slowly get there

1850
00:44:57,349 --> 00:44:57,359

 

1851
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:58,630

yeah
 

1853
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,589
yeah
automation that would be

1854
00:45:01,589 --> 00:45:01,599
automation that would be
 

1855
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:04,670
automation that would be
neat no I'm not the MVP I'm just I'm

1856

here but yeah from I don't know I feel
like one potential that could

1868
00:45:25,549 --> 00:45:25,559
like one potential that could
 

1869

like one potential that could
happen is that we have a sacrificial

1870
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:28,040
