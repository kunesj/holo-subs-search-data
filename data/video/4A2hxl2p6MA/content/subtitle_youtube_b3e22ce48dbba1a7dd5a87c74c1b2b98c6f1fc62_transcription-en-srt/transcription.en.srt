let's use another slider to find out
how accurate

986
00:23:51,909 --> 00:23:51,919

 

987
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:53,750

i you're you're calculating it
 

1009
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,590
i you're you're calculating it
differently then

1010
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:25,600
differently then
 

1011
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,710
differently then
it

1012
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:28,720

 

1013
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,350

uh

1020
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:38,960
uh
 

1021
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,510
uh
and i can what what

1022
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:41,520
and i can what what
 

1023
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,430
and i can what what
well i say

1024
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:43,440
well i say
 

1025
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,510
well i say
well if this is 24

1026
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:45,520
well if this is 24
 

1027
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,269
well if this is 24
hours and then the middle is 12

1028
00:24:49,269 --> 00:24:49,279
hours and then the middle is 12

00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,789
hours and then the middle is 12
p.m

1030
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:50,799
p.m
 

1031
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,549
p.m
so

1032
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:52,559
so
 

1033
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:56,310
so
2 p.m would be around here

1034
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:56,320
2 p.m would be around here
 

1035
