let's say you fall out of that portal
 

1539
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:50,630
let's say you fall out of that portal
at the top yeah and then you you fall

1540
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:50,640
at the top yeah and then you you fall
 

1541
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,349
at the top yeah and then you you fall
into that portal down here

1542
00:43:53,349 --> 00:43:53,359
into that portal down here
 

1543
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:54,309
into that portal down here
um

1544
00:43:54,309 --> 00:43:54,319
um
 

1545
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:56,390
um
that is called

1546
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:56,400
that is called
 

1547
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,750
that is called
momentum and the higher you fall

1548
00:43:59,750 --> 00:43:59,760
momentum and the higher you fall
 

1549
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,870
momentum and the higher you fall
the more

1550
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:00,880
the more
 

1551
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,589
the more
um like like okay wait no let's say you

1552
00:44:03,589 --> 00:44:03,599
um like like okay wait no let's say you
 

1553
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,309
um like like okay wait no let's say you
fall out of here and you fall into this

1554
00:44:06,309 --> 00:44:06,319
fall out of here and you fall into this
 

1555
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:08,710
fall out of here and you fall into this
one let's say if it was a pretty big

1556
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:08,720
one let's say if it was a pretty big
 

1557
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,550
one let's say if it was a pretty big
fall then once you go through this

1558
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:12,560
fall then once you go through this
 

1559
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,150
fall then once you go through this
portal again

1560
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:14,160
portal again
 

1561
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,790
portal again
uh you will fall like this way

1562
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:16,800
uh you will fall like this way
 

1563
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,950
uh you will fall like this way
very very far away so that's called

1564
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:18,960
very very far away so that's called
 

1565
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:26,450
very very far away so that's called
momentum okay perfect explanation

what is this laser
oh

3066
01:23:59,750 --> 01:23:59,760

 

3067
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:05,830

did i activate that because of the cube

3068
01:24:05,830 --> 01:24:05,840

 

3069
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:08,229

i think i activated that with the cube

3070
01:24:08,229 --> 01:24:08,239
i think i activated that with the cube
 

3071
01:24:08,239 --> 01:24:11,030
i think i activated that with the cube
because if i get rid of it

3072
01:24:11,030 --> 01:24:11,040
because if i get rid of it
 

3073

um
i i i want to place the cube the other

3084
01:24:25,430 --> 01:24:25,440
i i i want to place the cube the other
 

3085
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:27,510
i i i want to place the cube the other
way around uh and then make it go

3086
01:24:27,510 --> 01:24:27,520
way around uh and then make it go
 

3087
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:32,550
way around uh and then make it go
through ah portal i know

3088
01:24:32,550 --> 01:24:32,560

 

3089
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:35,590

sorry reflect two cubes

3090
01:24:35,590 --> 01:24:35,600
sorry reflect two cubes
 

3091
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:38,950
sorry reflect two cubes
okay we'll place it uh this way

3092
01:24:38,950 --> 01:24:38,960
okay we'll place it uh this way
 

3093
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:40,790
okay we'll place it uh this way
oh [\h__\h]

3094

what are you doing
i

3098
01:24:59,270 --> 01:24:59,280

 

3099
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:00,709

um

3100
01:25:00,709 --> 01:25:00,719
um
 

3101
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:03,910
um
this is kind of lower than i thought it

3102
01:25:03,910 --> 01:25:03,920
this is kind of lower than i thought it
 

3103
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:06,470
this is kind of lower than i thought it
would be

3104
01:25:06,470 --> 01:25:06,480
would be
 

3105
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:08,709
would be
i want it to be higher so i can send it

3106
01:25:08,709 --> 01:25:08,719
i want it to be higher so i can send it
 

3107
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:10,870
i want it to be higher so i can send it
through

3108
01:25:10,870 --> 01:25:10,880
through
 

3109
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:12,390
through
but can we like

3110
01:25:12,390 --> 01:25:12,400
but can we like
 

3111
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:15,990
but can we like
lower or erase this platform

3112
01:25:15,990 --> 01:25:16,000
lower or erase this platform
 

3113
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,149
lower or erase this platform
oh yeah you're right huh and then the

3114
01:25:18,149 --> 01:25:18,159
oh yeah you're right huh and then the
 

3115
01:25:18,159 --> 01:25:20,629
oh yeah you're right huh and then the
laser maybe will go through here and we

3116
01:25:20,629 --> 01:25:20,639
laser maybe will go through here and we
 

3117
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:29,669
laser maybe will go through here and we
can send it to go through here

3118
01:25:29,669 --> 01:25:29,679

 

3119
01:25:29,679 --> 01:25:32,149

it will probably

3120
01:25:32,149 --> 01:25:32,159
it will probably
 

3121
01:25:32,159 --> 01:25:36,870
it will probably
uh raise or lower if we push this button

3122
01:25:36,870 --> 01:25:36,880
uh raise or lower if we push this button
 

3123
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:39,430
uh raise or lower if we push this button
so we have to go through this

3124
01:25:39,430 --> 01:25:39,440
so we have to go through this
 

3125
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:41,910
so we have to go through this
catapult

3126
01:25:41,910 --> 01:25:41,920
catapult
 

3127
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:43,510
catapult
oh look there's the oh there's the

3128
01:25:43,510 --> 01:25:43,520
oh look there's the oh there's the
 

3129
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:45,750
oh look there's the oh there's the
momentum

3130
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:45,760
momentum
 

3131
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:48,870
momentum
yeah there's a momentum

3132
01:25:48,870 --> 01:25:48,880
yeah there's a momentum
 

3133
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:50,790
yeah there's a momentum
i'm not not this is ah

3134
01:25:50,790 --> 01:25:50,800
i'm not not this is ah
 

3135
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:53,110
i'm not not this is ah
ah

3136
01:25:53,110 --> 01:25:53,120
ah
 

3137
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:56,390
ah
with the catapult we can go through

3138
01:25:56,390 --> 01:25:56,400
with the catapult we can go through
 

3139
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:57,990
with the catapult we can go through
that

3140
01:25:57,990 --> 01:25:58,000
that
 

3141
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,590
that
uh

3142
01:25:59,590 --> 01:25:59,600
uh
 

3143
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:01,430
uh
that portal

3144
01:26:01,430 --> 01:26:01,440
that portal
 

3145
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:03,189
that portal
and then

3146
01:26:03,189 --> 01:26:03,199
and then
 

3147
01:26:03,199 --> 01:26:05,110
and then
we want to go

3148
01:26:05,110 --> 01:26:05,120
we want to go
 

3149
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:12,610
we want to go
i don't know where

3150
01:26:12,610 --> 01:26:12,620

um
 

4447
02:01:42,480 --> 02:01:45,589
um
can you make a portal here

4448
02:01:45,589 --> 02:01:45,599
can you make a portal here
 

4449
02:01:45,599 --> 02:01:47,669
can you make a portal here
oh yeah oh yeah

4450
02:01:47,669 --> 02:01:47,679

4453
02:01:52,480 --> 02:01:56,950

a bit more to the right i think

4454
02:01:56,950 --> 02:01:56,960

 

4455
02:01:56,960 --> 02:02:00,310

to the right

4456
02:02:00,310 --> 02:02:00,320

 

4457
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:03,990

but uh angled straight

4458
02:02:03,990 --> 02:02:04,000
but uh angled straight
 

4459
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:05,750
but uh angled straight
and go straight

4460
02:02:05,750 --> 02:02:05,760
and go straight
 

4461
02:02:05,760 --> 02:02:07,750
and go straight
yeah it has to be more straight so it

4462
02:02:07,750 --> 02:02:07,760
yeah it has to be more straight so it
 

4463
02:02:07,760 --> 02:02:10,070
yeah it has to be more straight so it
stops yeah exactly does that work so

4464
02:02:10,070 --> 02:02:10,080
stops yeah exactly does that work so
 

4465
02:02:10,080 --> 02:02:14,310
stops yeah exactly does that work so

can you learn it that fast

4548
02:04:10,470 --> 02:04:10,480
can you learn it that fast
 

4549
02:04:10,480 --> 02:04:12,950
can you learn it that fast
i don't think it's fast though i'm i

4550
02:04:12,950 --> 02:04:12,960
i don't think it's fast though i'm i
 

4551
02:04:12,960 --> 02:04:14,950
i don't think it's fast though i'm i
mean there's still so much i need to

4552
02:04:14,950 --> 02:04:14,960
mean there's still so much i need to
 

4553
02:04:14,960 --> 02:04:17,910
mean there's still so much i need to
learn about the language

4554
02:04:17,910 --> 02:04:17,920
learn about the language
 

4555
02:04:17,920 --> 02:04:19,750
learn about the language
i guess so

4556
02:04:19,750 --> 02:04:19,760
i guess so
 

4557
02:04:19,760 --> 02:04:20,550
i guess so
but

4558
02:04:20,550 --> 02:04:20,560
but
 

4559
02:04:20,560 --> 02:04:23,910
but
