the game i wonder although but still i
mean

3878
01:41:13,030 --> 01:41:13,040
mean
 

3879
01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:14,870
mean
it's not the language isn't even that

3880
01:41:14,870 --> 01:41:14,880
it's not the language isn't even that
 

3881
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:18,229
it's not the language isn't even that
important we could play it anyway

3882
01:41:18,229 --> 01:41:18,239
important we could play it anyway
 

3883
01:41:18,239 --> 01:41:20,310
important we could play it anyway
yeah we could probably play it anyway

3884
01:41:20,310 --> 01:41:20,320
yeah we could probably play it anyway
 

3885
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:21,510
yeah we could probably play it anyway
and i could try but

3886
01:41:21,510 --> 01:41:21,520
and i could try but
 

3887
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:22,709
and i could try but
i could try to translate but the

3888
01:41:22,709 --> 01:41:22,719
i could try to translate but the
 

3889
01:41:22,719 --> 01:41:24,629
i could try to translate but the
situations are passing and the text is

3890
01:41:24,629 --> 01:41:24,639
situations are passing and the text is
 

3891
01:41:24,639 --> 01:41:26,070
situations are passing and the text is
passing so quickly so i probably

3892
01:41:26,070 --> 01:41:26,080
passing so quickly so i probably
 

3893
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:28,310
passing so quickly so i probably
wouldn't have the time to translate

3894
01:41:28,310 --> 01:41:28,320
wouldn't have the time to translate
 

3895
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:32,709
wouldn't have the time to translate
uh but as i said yeah it probably

3896
01:41:32,709 --> 01:41:32,719
uh but as i said yeah it probably
 

3897
01:41:32,719 --> 01:41:35,750
uh but as i said yeah it probably
would be fine to just

3898
01:41:35,750 --> 01:41:35,760
would be fine to just
 

3899
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:39,910
would be fine to just
play it anyway or

3900
01:41:39,910 --> 01:41:39,920
