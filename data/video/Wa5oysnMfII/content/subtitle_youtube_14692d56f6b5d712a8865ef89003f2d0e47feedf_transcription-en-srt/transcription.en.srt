00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:52,370
um like next turn if I use worm select
can I like use an item again or I think

1404
00:49:52,370 --> 00:49:52,380
can I like use an item again or I think
 

1405
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:54,290
can I like use an item again or I think
so but yeah you want a warm select then

1406
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:54,300
so but yeah you want a warm select then
 

1407
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:56,089
so but yeah you want a warm select then
probably teleport you should be able to

1408
00:49:56,089 --> 00:49:56,099
probably teleport you should be able to
 

1409
00:49:56,099 --> 00:49:59,270
probably teleport you should be able to
