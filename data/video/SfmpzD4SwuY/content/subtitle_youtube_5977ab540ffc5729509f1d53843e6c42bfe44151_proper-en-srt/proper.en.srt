00:00:00,584 --> 00:00:01,685
​​​ ​1, 2.​ ​​

2
00:00:01,685 --> 00:00:03,153
​​​ ​Can you hear me?​ ​​

3
00:00:03,153 --> 00:00:04,722
​​​ ​We've left the stage area​ ​​
​​ ​and are now in...​ ​​

4
00:00:04,722 --> 00:00:05,556
​​​ ​Ta-da!​ ​​

5
00:00:05,556 --> 00:00:06,423
​​​ ​The green room!​ ​​

6
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:07,091
​​​ ​Whoa, whoa!​ ​​

7
00:00:07,091 --> 00:00:08,392
​​​ ​Wait, timeout!​ ​​

8
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:08,392
​​​ ​Chama!​ ​​

9
00:00:08,726 --> 00:00:09,393
​​​ ​Well?​ ​​

10
00:00:09,393 --> 00:00:10,728
​​​ ​How are you feeling right now?​ ​​

11
00:00:10,728 --> 00:00:13,330
​​​ ​Please wait for​ ​​
​​ ​Sora-senpai to get changed.​ ​​

12
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:14,098
​​​ ​Well?​ ​​

13
00:00:14,098 --> 00:00:15,366
​​​ ​How are you feeling right now?​ ​​

14
00:00:15,366 --> 00:00:16,700
​​​ ​Words can't get through to her!​ ​​

15
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,635
​​​ ​What a problem child.​ ​​

16
00:00:18,635 --> 00:00:20,871
​​​ ​Bad girls get punished.​ ​​

17
00:00:20,871 --> 00:00:22,506
​​​ ​Go get her!​ ​​

18
00:00:22,506 --> 00:00:23,907
​​​ ​Hey! I'm a founder here!​ ​​

19
00:00:23,907 --> 00:00:26,010
​​​ ​Yeah, well, I'm half-angel, half-demon.​ ​​

20
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,978
​​​ ​And I'm a badass!​ ​​

21
00:00:27,978 --> 00:00:28,045
​​​ ​Argh! Argh!​ ​​

00:00:28,045 --> 00:00:28,112

​​​ ​Argh! Argh!​ ​​

00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:29,446
​​​ ​Argh! Argh!​ ​​

44
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:29,513
​​​ ​Argh! Argh!​ ​​

45
00:00:29,513 --> 00:00:29,580
​​​ ​Argh! Argh!​ ​​

46
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:29,646
​​​ ​Argh! Argh!​ ​​

​​​ ​Okay, let's take a look at​ ​​
​​ ​our next green room.​ ​​

54
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:36,987
​​​ ​Hello!​ ​​

55
00:00:36,987 --> 00:00:39,089
​​​ ​Whoa, what's with the wind?​ ​​

56
00:00:39,089 --> 00:00:41,425
​​​ ​Why is this room so windy?!​ ​​

57
00:00:41,425 --> 00:00:43,293
​​​ ​Oh no! I'm gonna get blown away!​ ​​

58
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:43,360
​​​ ​Yeet!​ ​​

59
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:43,427
​​​ ​Yeet!​ ​​

60
00:00:43,427 --> 00:00:43,494
​​​ ​Yeet!​ ​​

61
00:00:43,494 --> 00:00:43,560
​​​ ​Yeet!​ ​​

62
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:43,627
​​​ ​Yeet!​ ​​

63
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:43,694
​​​ ​Yeet!​ ​​

64
00:00:43,694 --> 00:00:43,761
​​​ ​Yeet!​ ​​

65
00:00:43,761 --> 00:00:43,827
​​​ ​Yeet!​ ​​

66
00:00:43,827 --> 00:00:43,894
​​​ ​Yeet!​ ​​

67
00:00:43,894 --> 00:00:43,961
​​​ ​Yeet!​ ​​

68
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:44,061
​​​ ​Yeet!​ ​​

69
00:00:44,061 --> 00:00:45,262
​​​ ​I smell a case.​ ​​

70
00:00:45,262 --> 00:00:47,031
​​​ ​The police will be right on it!​ ​​

71
00:00:47,564 --> 00:00:53,337
​​​ ​Suspected Gale​ ​​
​​ ​in Green Room​ ​​

72
00:00:47,564 --> 00:00:53,337
​​​ ​Suspect Sakura Miko Arrested​ ​​

73
00:00:48,232 --> 00:00:50,734
​​​ ​It wasn't me! I didn't do anything!​ ​​

74
00:00:50,734 --> 00:00:51,935
​​​ ​Hear me out, Senpai!​ ​​

75
00:00:51,935 --> 00:00:53,337
​​​ ​Why me too?​ ​​

76
00:00:53,337 --> 00:00:54,338
​​​ ​Uh,​ ​​

77
00:00:54,338 --> 00:00:57,241
​​​ ​well, looks like they've​ ​​
​​ ​all been arrested.​ ​​

78
00:00:58,709 --> 00:00:59,676
​​​ ​In this green room we have...​ ​​

79
00:00:59,676 --> 00:01:01,211
​​​ ​Whoa, booze alert.​ ​​

80
00:01:01,211 --> 00:01:02,880
​​​ ​Have a drink, pump yourself up.​ ​​

81
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,315
​​​ ​You won't accept the drink​ ​​
​​ ​I'm offering you?​ ​​

82
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,418
​​​ ​I can't drink any more...​ ​​

83
00:01:07,785 --> 00:01:08,685
​​​ ​Wow.​ ​​

84
00:01:08,685 --> 00:01:11,455
​​​ ​They're drunk in the​ ​​
​​ ​middle of the concert.​ ​​

85
00:01:11,455 --> 00:01:12,623
​​​ ​Yikes!​ ​​

86
00:01:13,023 --> 00:01:14,658
​​​ ​Ramen's the perfect capper.​ ​​

87
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:16,727
​​​ ​The owl stock adds​ ​​
​​ ​some nice flavor to it.​ ​​

88
00:01:16,727 --> 00:01:18,629
​​​ ​Don't make stock out of me!​ ​​

89
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:20,531
​​​ ​It's missing the secret ingredient.​ ​​

90
00:01:20,531 --> 00:01:22,633
​​​ ​And lacking spice.​ ​​

91
00:01:22,633 --> 00:01:24,101
​​​ ​Hmm, it needs more meat, too.​ ​​

92
00:01:24,101 --> 00:01:24,935
​​​ ​Yikes!​ ​​

93
00:01:25,636 --> 00:01:26,670
​​​ ​Let's hit up the next joint.​ ​​

94
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,173
​​​ ​Hey, missy,​ ​​
​​ ​you haven't paid your tab yet.​ ​​

95
00:01:29,173 --> 00:01:31,175
​​​ ​Gosh, that room reeks of booze.​ ​​

96
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:33,043
​​​ ​Let's move on to the next one.​ ​​

97
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,947
​​​ ​Something smells good.​ ​​

98
00:01:36,947 --> 00:01:39,416
​​​ ​Yeah, this is really great.​ ​​

99
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:42,052
​​​ ​Why must you be so yummy?​ ​​

100
00:01:42,052 --> 00:01:44,221
​​​ ​Eat up! I'll keep 'em coming!​ ​​

101
00:01:44,221 --> 00:01:46,223
​​​ ​They're eating your kind.​ ​​

102
00:01:46,223 --> 00:01:48,325
​​​ ​How does it make you feel?​ ​​

103
00:01:48,325 --> 00:01:51,228
​​​ ​As long as everyone​ ​​
​​ ​appreciates the taste, it's fine.​ ​​

104
00:01:52,162 --> 00:01:54,131
​​​ ​Whoa! This one's got a pepper in it!​ ​​

105
00:01:54,131 --> 00:01:55,566
​​​ ​And mine had plum.​ ​​

106
00:01:55,566 --> 00:01:57,267
​​​ ​Mine had Indonesia in it!​ ​​

107
00:01:57,267 --> 00:01:58,769
​​​ ​This may be a​ ​​
​​ ​prime business opportunity.​ ​​

108
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:00,871
​​​ ​Enjoy all the different flavors.​ ​​

109
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:03,073
​​​ ​Ah, takoyaki parties are always a riot.​ ​​

110
00:02:03,073 --> 00:02:06,477
​​​ ​Let's move on.​ ​​

111
00:02:07,344 --> 00:02:08,912
​​​ ​Locker room interview!​ ​​

​​​ ​Oh? You here for mods?​ ​​

​​​ ​Oh? You here to party?​ ​​

​​​ ​Interview, okay?​ ​​

117
00:02:15,853 --> 00:02:17,621
​​​ ​Er, um...​ ​​

118
00:02:17,621 --> 00:02:19,690
​​​ ​No need to force a joke!​ ​​

119
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,658
​​​ ​Hah. Well...​ ​​

120
00:02:21,658 --> 00:02:24,261
​​​ ​Did you all listen to our song?​ ​​

121
00:02:24,261 --> 00:02:25,963
​​​ ​Enjoy the rest of the show as well!​ ​​

122
00:02:25,963 --> 00:02:28,832

​​​ ​How's it feel?​ ​​

127
00:02:38,308 --> 00:02:39,409
​​​ ​Huh? What do you mean?​ ​​

​​​ ​We'll do the interviews next.​ ​​

141
00:02:57,828 --> 00:02:59,096
​​​ ​I didn't mean that!​ ​​

142
00:02:59,463 --> 00:03:00,430

00:03:08,005 --> 00:03:09,573
​​​ ​It'll be 2024 soon!​ ​​

00:03:21,752 --> 00:03:24,087
​​​ ​Yikes, we need to move on!​ ​​

00:03:40,437 --> 00:03:41,872
​​​ ​Quit whining! The year's about to end!​ ​​

166
00:03:41,872 --> 00:03:43,907
​​​ ​I don't want to welcome the new year​ ​​
​​ ​in this crazy place!​ ​​

167
00:03:43,907 --> 00:03:44,708
​​​ ​Bwahaha!​ ​​

168
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,143
​​​ ​Then try and stop us!​ ​​

169
00:03:46,243 --> 00:03:48,378
​​​ ​I'm closing the tab.​ ​​

​​​ ​I gan't do da goundown lige dis!​ ​​

201
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,568
​​​ ​She needs facial reconstruction.​ ​​

202
00:04:11,568 --> 00:04:13,437
​​​ ​And... why are you looking at me?​ ​​

203
00:04:13,437 --> 00:04:17,074
​​​ ​We figured you wouldn't hold back.​ ​​

204
00:04:17,074 --> 00:04:18,575
​​​ ​Come at me, bro!​ ​​

205
00:04:18,575 --> 00:04:19,810
​​​ ​Okay, you asked for it.​ ​​

​​​ ​Okay, let's check out​ ​​
​​ ​the next green room.​ ​​

208
00:04:26,383 --> 00:04:27,684
​​​ ​Hello!​ ​​

00:04:29,753 --> 00:04:30,654
​​​ ​Haha!​ ​​

212
00:04:30,654 --> 00:04:33,824
​​​ ​Their funny bone's gone all funny​ ​​
​​ ​due to excess magic intake.​ ​​

213
00:04:33,824 --> 00:04:35,325
​​​ ​You eat this, too!​ ​​

214
00:04:35,325 --> 00:04:36,126
​​​ ​Ha-ha!​ ​​

​​​ ​What the...​ ​​

217
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,397
​​​ ​It's too early for you, kid.​ ​​

218
00:04:40,397 --> 00:04:41,898
​​​ ​You're just as much a kid as me!​ ​​

219
00:04:41,898 --> 00:04:44,234
​​​ ​Takes one to know one!​ ​​

220
00:04:44,234 --> 00:04:45,435
​​​ ​W-Watch out!​ ​​

221
00:04:45,435 --> 00:04:46,803
​​​ ​Whoa!​ ​​

222
00:04:47,638 --> 00:04:49,139
​​​ ​Pfft! Bwahahaha!​ ​​

223
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:51,141
​​​ ​Bwahahaha!​ ​​

00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:53,076
​​​ ​Gah!​ ​​

00:04:53,076 --> 00:04:54,344
​​​ ​This is boring!​ ​​

229
00:04:54,344 --> 00:04:55,879
​​​ ​I'm hitting up the next room!​ ​​

230
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:58,115
​​​ ​Hollo!​ ​​

231
00:04:58,115 --> 00:05:00,217
​​​ ​Hey! The baby's asleep!​ ​​

232
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:03,086
​​​ ​I'm supposed to be the baby,​ ​​
​​ ​but I'm wakey.​ ​​

233
00:05:03,086 --> 00:05:05,756
​​​ ​We should hit the hay too, honey.​ ​​

234
00:05:05,756 --> 00:05:07,024
​​​ ​Who are you calling honey?!​ ​​

235
00:05:07,024 --> 00:05:09,192
​​​ ​I'm going to sleep too!​ ​​

236
00:05:09,192 --> 00:05:10,327
​​​ ​Oh, man, fine.​ ​​

237
00:05:10,327 --> 00:05:12,095
​​​ ​The great Towa will lull you to sleep.​ ​​

238
00:05:12,095 --> 00:05:13,797
​​​ ​May I join you?​ ​​

239
00:05:13,797 --> 00:05:15,932
​​​ ​Dear, who is this man?!​ ​​

240
00:05:15,932 --> 00:05:18,535
​​​ ​I... I don't know! Please believe me!​ ​​

241
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:19,336
​​​ ​Phooey.​ ​​

242
00:05:19,336 --> 00:05:22,139
​​​ ​I'm tired of pwaying the baby.​ ​​

243
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:24,041
​​​ ​Mom'll take over on the mic, then.​ ​​

244
00:05:24,441 --> 00:05:26,743
​​​ ​Here's our next green room.​ ​​

245
00:05:27,611 --> 00:05:28,812

​​​ ​Graaagh!​ ​​

274
00:05:30,681 --> 00:05:33,417
​​​ ​Korone-senpai spun around too much!​ ​​
​​ ​Now she can't stop!​ ​​

275
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:35,018
​​​ ​Can't stop, won't stop!​ ​​

276
00:05:35,018 --> 00:05:35,786

​​​ ​A-Anyway, I'm here for an interv—​ ​​

281
00:05:40,724 --> 00:05:42,125
​​​ ​My mic!​ ​​

282
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,594
​​​ ​This is no time for an interview!​ ​​

283
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,063
​​​ ​Help us, Choco-sensei!​ ​​

284
00:05:46,063 --> 00:05:47,130
​​​ ​Uh...​ ​​

285
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,066
​​​ ​Great! I shall go to the​ ​​
​​ ​next room over, then.​ ​​

286
00:05:49,066 --> 00:05:50,267
​​​ ​Ayame-sama!​ ​​

287
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,668
​​​ ​Stay and help!​ ​​

288
00:05:51,668 --> 00:05:52,936
​​​ ​Ayame-sama!​ ​​

289
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,304
​​​ ​Oh, hey.​ ​​

290
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:58,875
​​​ ​Sorry I'm so not cute.​ ​​
​​ ​Sorry I'm always so gloomy.​ ​​

291
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:01,712
​​​ ​Sorry I'm so not cute.​ ​​
​​ ​Sorry I'm a shark.​ ​​

292
00:06:01,712 --> 00:06:04,314
​​​ ​Sorry I'm so not cute.​ ​​
​​ ​Sorry I'm an alien.​ ​​

293
00:06:04,314 --> 00:06:06,283
​​​ ​They're feeling the song's​ ​​
​​ ​withdrawal effects!​ ​​

294
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:08,685
​​​ ​We've still got performances to go,​ ​​

295
00:06:08,685 --> 00:06:10,387
​​​ ​so quit getting all depressed.​ ​​

296
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,455
​​​ ​Huh?​ ​​

297
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:14,491
​​​ ​Pekora-senpai doesn't seem​ ​​
​​ ​to be affected, I daresay.​ ​​

298
00:06:14,491 --> 00:06:16,093
​​​ ​Sorry I'm so cute!​ ​​

299
00:06:16,093 --> 00:06:16,960
​​​ ​This bunny...​ ​​

300
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,995
​​​ ​She's got so much self-esteem!​ ​​

301
00:06:18,995 --> 00:06:21,198
​​​ ​Stop that.​ ​​
​​ ​You're all cute!​ ​​

302
00:06:21,198 --> 00:06:22,766
​​​ ​Sora-senpai!​ ​​

303
00:06:21,198 --> 00:06:22,766
​​​ ​Sora-senpai!​ ​​

304
00:06:21,198 --> 00:06:22,766
​​​ ​Sora-senpai!​ ​​

305
00:06:21,198 --> 00:06:22,766
​​​ ​Sora-senpai!​ ​​

306
00:06:27,938 --> 00:06:29,906
​​​ ​Anyway, all said and done...​ ​​

307
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,576
​​​ ​...we're only a few seconds away​ ​​
​​ ​from 2024!​ ​​

308
00:06:33,043 --> 00:06:35,912
​​​ ​Man, that whole year​ ​​
​​ ​felt like it just flew by.​ ​​

309
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,850
​​​ ​We'll keep going next year!​ ​​

310
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:41,852
​​​ ​Together with everyone!​ ​​

311
00:06:42,552 --> 00:06:45,188
