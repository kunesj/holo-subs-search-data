00:10:47,069 --> 00:10:47,079
work I did two things I don't know which
 

341
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:49,870
work I did two things I don't know which
one it was I think it's me just moving

342
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:49,880
one it was I think it's me just moving
 

343
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,069
one it was I think it's me just moving
the mobile router to a different

344
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:52,079
the mobile router to a different
 

345
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,829
the mobile router to a different
position cuz the the like how to say

346
00:10:56,829 --> 00:10:56,839
position cuz the the like how to say
 

347
00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:01,990
position cuz the the like how to say
the m signal the signal was just better

348
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,000
the m signal the signal was just better
 

349
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,590
the m signal the signal was just better
5 cm to the

350
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:04,600
5 cm to the
 

351
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,629
5 cm to the
left I think and then I I kind of

352
00:11:09,629 --> 00:11:09,639
left I think and then I I kind of
 

353
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:13,590
left I think and then I I kind of
opened like the

354
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:13,600
opened like the
 

355
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,269
opened like the
curtains hoping hoping that it will come

356
00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:18,279
curtains hoping hoping that it will come
 

357
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:22,190
curtains hoping hoping that it will come
through I don't know if a signal like

358
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:22,200
through I don't know if a signal like
 

359
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,350
through I don't know if a signal like
has a harder time coming in through a

360
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:25,360
has a harder time coming in through a
 

361
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,150
has a harder time coming in through a
curtain but yeah just moved it a little

362
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:28,160
curtain but yeah just moved it a little
 

363
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,310
curtain but yeah just moved it a little
bit and then it kind of works and I

364
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:31,320
bit and then it kind of works and I
 

365
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,990
bit and then it kind of works and I
think it's really that uh sensitive I

366
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:34,000
think it's really that uh sensitive I
 

367
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,269
think it's really that uh sensitive I
think it really

368
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:36,279
think it really
 

369
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:40,790
think it really
is in terms of positioning mhm cuz I

370
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:40,800
is in terms of positioning mhm cuz I
 

371
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,750
is in terms of positioning mhm cuz I
tested it with my phone and depending on

372
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:43,760
tested it with my phone and depending on
 

373
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,389
tested it with my phone and depending on
where I was standing and how close I was

374
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:46,399
where I was standing and how close I was
 

375
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,310
where I was standing and how close I was
to the window depending on that my phone

376
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:49,320
to the window depending on that my phone
 

377
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:54,430
to the window depending on that my phone

router is not connected to you know the
 

403
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:30,550
router is not connected to you know the
the usual

404
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:30,560
the usual
 

405
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,910
the usual
internet uh opening in the wall no it's

406
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:33,920
internet uh opening in the wall no it's
 

407
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,310
internet uh opening in the wall no it's
just picking it up from like the signal

408
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:36,320
just picking it up from like the signal
 

409
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,509
just picking it up from like the signal
from outside I guess I'm I'm guessing

410
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:38,519
from outside I guess I'm I'm guessing
 

411
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,150
from outside I guess I'm I'm guessing
it's the same signal as what the phone

412
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:40,160
it's the same signal as what the phone
 

413
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,750
it's the same signal as what the phone
would pick up right yeah the F shy the

1375
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:56,230
have to be able to communicate with that
human as well then but let's say let's

1376
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:56,240
human as well then but let's say let's
 

1377
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,309
human as well then but let's say let's
say there somehow preventing you from

1378
00:35:58,309 --> 00:35:58,319
say there somehow preventing you from
 

1379
00:35:58,319 --> 00:36:00,990

use the cat to like I say something to
 

1383
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,510
use the cat to like I say something to
the cat and the cat relates it to the

00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,950
the cat and the cat relates it to the
other person who's also able to talk to

00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,230
life on it or like at least has the
criteria to have life on it but like 100

1964
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:26,240
criteria to have life on it but like 100
 

1965
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:28,589
criteria to have life on it but like 100
light years away and then I Googled how

1966
00:50:28,589 --> 00:50:28,599
light years away and then I Googled how
 

1967
00:50:28,599 --> 00:50:31,270
light years away and then I Googled how
long it takes to get there in 100 light

1968
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:31,280
long it takes to get there in 100 light
 

1969
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,990
long it takes to get there in 100 light
years and I had some conflicting results

1970
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:35,000
years and I had some conflicting results
 

1971
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,150
years and I had some conflicting results
how long does it actually take if I am

1972
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:37,160
how long does it actually take if I am
 

1973
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,829
how long does it actually take if I am
in like

1974
00:50:38,829 --> 00:50:38,839
in like
 

1975
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:41,309

1983
00:50:51,319 --> 00:50:53,829

then we should [\h__\h] send someone to

then we should [\h__\h] send someone to
 

1985
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:59,470

01:23:47,310 --> 01:23:47,320
things I've ever wanted and gotten most
 

3345
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:49,470
things I've ever wanted and gotten most
things I ever wanted and then the last

3346
01:23:49,470 --> 01:23:49,480
things I ever wanted and then the last
 

3347
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:53,149
things I ever wanted and then the last
few things that would be left over would

3348
01:23:53,149 --> 01:23:53,159
few things that would be left over would
 

3349
01:23:53,159 --> 01:23:55,870
few things that would be left over would
maybe be something

3350
01:23:55,870 --> 01:23:55,880
maybe be something
 

3351
01:23:55,880 --> 01:24:00,750
maybe be something
like $20 million and a yacht and

3352
01:24:00,750 --> 01:24:00,760
like $20 million and a yacht and
 

3353
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:03,910
like $20 million and a yacht and
whatever and then yeah I get to use it a

3354
01:24:03,910 --> 01:24:03,920
whatever and then yeah I get to use it a
 

3355
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:04,990
whatever and then yeah I get to use it a
little

3356
01:24:04,990 --> 01:24:05,000
little
 

3357
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:09,390
little
bit yeah maybe I don't even know if I

3358
01:24:09,390 --> 01:24:09,400
bit yeah maybe I don't even know if I
 

3359
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:11,590
bit yeah maybe I don't even know if I
want it right now like right now I don't

3360
01:24:11,590 --> 01:24:11,600
want it right now like right now I don't
 

3361
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:13,510
want it right now like right now I don't
have a desire so I can't say I want it

3362
01:24:13,510 --> 01:24:13,520
have a desire so I can't say I want it
 

3363
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:15,470
have a desire so I can't say I want it

3365
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:17,790

01:39:35,750 --> 01:39:35,760
right now but that would be a political
 

3981
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:40,750

3987
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:47,870
could probably force myself to think
that those are real friends even if

3988
01:39:47,870 --> 01:39:47,880
that those are real friends even if
 

3989

that's a little bit too long what's 20

4002
01:40:09,070 --> 01:40:09,080
that's a little bit too long what's 20

lifespan like a human lifespan let's
 

4009
01:40:16,520 --> 01:40:19,270
lifespan like a human lifespan let's
just assume

4010
01:40:19,270 --> 01:40:19,280

think it's amazing if people believe in
it because that certainly takes away

it because that certainly takes away
 

4859
02:02:00,239 --> 02:02:01,870
it because that certainly takes away
some fear of

02:02:01,880 --> 02:02:04,669
some fear of
dying but I don't believe in it and that

4865
02:02:06,560 --> 02:02:10,069
that's also what makes it scary but
whatever like I I trust

02:22:39,880 --> 02:22:42,670
in one job so you do the job for you're
like a trainee at that job for uh 10

5668
02:22:42,670 --> 02:22:42,680
like a trainee at that job for uh 10
 

5669
02:22:42,680 --> 02:22:45,870
like a trainee at that job for uh 10
months a year for three years and the

5670
02:22:45,870 --> 02:22:45,880

instead in between you have a step of

9400
03:53:15,110 --> 03:53:15,120
instead in between you have a step of
 

9401
03:53:15,120 --> 03:53:18,189
instead in between you have a step of
zero to like 50 because 50 is taking

9402
03:53:18,189 --> 03:53:18,199
zero to like 50 because 50 is taking
 

9403
03:53:18,199 --> 03:53:20,950
zero to like 50 because 50 is taking
care of a pet although some pets are

9404
03:53:20,950 --> 03:53:20,960
care of a pet although some pets are
 

9405
03:53:20,960 --> 03:53:23,429
care of a pet although some pets are
more difficult to take care of and

9406
03:53:23,429 --> 03:53:23,439
more difficult to take care of and
 

9407
03:53:23,439 --> 03:53:26,229
more difficult to take care of and
therefore a higher level yeah you learn

9408
03:53:26,229 --> 03:53:26,239
therefore a higher level yeah you learn
 

9409
03:53:26,239 --> 03:53:29,870
therefore a higher level yeah you learn
some for sure like having to feed them

some point
 

9781
04:01:58,840 --> 04:02:04,670
some point
probably uh it just

9782
04:02:04,670 --> 04:02:04,680

 

9783
04:02:04,680 --> 04:02:07,910

like how to say I think I think just

9784
04:02:07,910 --> 04:02:07,920
like how to say I think I think just
 

9785
04:02:07,920 --> 04:02:08,950
like how to say I think I think just
like

9786
04:02:08,950 --> 04:02:08,960
like
 

9787
04:02:08,960 --> 04:02:10,030
like
it probably

9788
04:02:10,030 --> 04:02:10,040
it probably
 

9789
04:02:10,040 --> 04:02:12,750
it probably
stopped uh

9790
04:02:12,750 --> 04:02:12,760
stopped uh
 

9791
04:02:12,760 --> 04:02:16,590
stopped uh
being emptied out

9792
04:02:16,590 --> 04:02:16,600
being emptied out
 

9793
04:02:16,600 --> 04:02:20,309
being emptied out
properly uh maybe at some point and

9794
04:02:20,309 --> 04:02:20,319
properly uh maybe at some point and
 

9795
04:02:20,319 --> 04:02:23,750
properly uh maybe at some point and
then all the all the

9796
04:02:23,750 --> 04:02:23,760
then all the all the
 

9797
04:02:23,760 --> 04:02:28,910
then all the all the
wet somewhat wet moist sand in the

9798
04:02:28,910 --> 04:02:28,920
wet somewhat wet moist sand in the
 

9799
04:02:28,920 --> 04:02:32,349
wet somewhat wet moist sand in the
bottom drawer probably just um spread

9800
04:02:32,349 --> 04:02:32,359
bottom drawer probably just um spread
 

9801
04:02:32,359 --> 04:02:34,070
bottom drawer probably just um spread
too much humidity which is so weird

9802
04:02:34,070 --> 04:02:34,080
too much humidity which is so weird
 

9803
04:02:34,080 --> 04:02:36,349
too much humidity which is so weird
though because all of it is

9804
04:02:36,349 --> 04:02:36,359
though because all of it is
 

9805
04:02:36,359 --> 04:02:39,910
though because all of it is
like like within in like especially the

04:02:39,910 --> 04:02:39,920
like like within in like especially the
 

9807
04:02:39,920 --> 04:02:43,830
like like within in like especially the
used sand is in a closed off solid

9808
04:02:43,830 --> 04:02:43,840
used sand is in a closed off solid
 

9809
04:02:43,840 --> 04:02:49,189
used sand is in a closed off solid
plastic container drawer basically solid

9810
04:02:49,189 --> 04:02:49,199
plastic container drawer basically solid
 

9811
04:02:49,199 --> 04:02:51,990
plastic container drawer basically solid
like it fascinates me that that can

9812
04:02:51,990 --> 04:02:52,000
like it fascinates me that that can
 

9813
04:02:52,000 --> 04:02:53,349
like it fascinates me that that can
still

9814
04:02:53,349 --> 04:02:53,359
still
 

9815
04:02:53,359 --> 04:02:56,100
still
affect the wood

9816
04:02:56,100 --> 04:02:56,110

staining out I I looked it up I looked

9822
04:03:03,469 --> 04:03:03,479
staining out I I looked it up I looked
 

9823
04:03:03,479 --> 04:03:06,710
staining out I I looked it up I looked
up these issues and I looked up like

9824
04:03:06,710 --> 04:03:06,720
up these issues and I looked up like
 

9825
04:03:06,720 --> 04:03:08,349
up these issues and I looked up like
ways to fix it and then there's there

9826
04:03:08,349 --> 04:03:08,359
ways to fix it and then there's there
 

9827
04:03:08,359 --> 04:03:11,429
ways to fix it and then there's there
were several suggestions on how to fix

9828
04:03:11,429 --> 04:03:11,439
were several suggestions on how to fix
 

9829
04:03:11,439 --> 04:03:13,950
were several suggestions on how to fix
it but all of them were like be careful

9830
04:03:13,950 --> 04:03:13,960
it but all of them were like be careful
 

9831
04:03:13,960 --> 04:03:15,870
it but all of them were like be careful
it might not work be careful it might

9832
04:03:15,870 --> 04:03:15,880
it might not work be careful it might
 

9833
04:03:15,880 --> 04:03:18,750
it might not work be careful it might
make it worse it might not but it might

9834
04:03:18,750 --> 04:03:18,760
make it worse it might not but it might
 

9835
04:03:18,760 --> 04:03:20,790
make it worse it might not but it might
fix it but it also might make it worse

9836
04:03:20,790 --> 04:03:20,800
fix it but it also might make it worse
 

9837
04:03:20,800 --> 04:03:23,550
fix it but it also might make it worse
like you can't be sure and all that and

9838
04:03:23,550 --> 04:03:23,560
like you can't be sure and all that and
 

9839
04:03:23,560 --> 04:03:25,630
like you can't be sure and all that and
especially depending on what kind of

9840
04:03:25,630 --> 04:03:25,640
especially depending on what kind of
 

9841
04:03:25,640 --> 04:03:28,830
especially depending on what kind of
stain it is uh BL blah blue I don't know

9842
04:03:28,830 --> 04:03:28,840
stain it is uh BL blah blue I don't know
 

9843
04:03:28,840 --> 04:03:30,790
stain it is uh BL blah blue I don't know
it's

9844
04:03:30,790 --> 04:03:30,800
it's
 

9845
04:03:30,800 --> 04:03:33,229
it's
like I couldn't find anything that's

9846
04:03:33,229 --> 04:03:33,239
like I couldn't find anything that's
 

9847
04:03:33,239 --> 04:03:35,030
like I couldn't find anything that's
like really

9848
04:03:35,030 --> 04:03:35,040
like really
 

9849
04:03:35,040 --> 04:03:36,870
like really
certainly the

9850
04:03:36,870 --> 04:03:36,880
certainly the
 

9851
04:03:36,880 --> 04:03:40,670
certainly the
solution even even if the example

9852
04:03:40,670 --> 04:03:40,680
solution even even if the example
 

9853
04:03:40,680 --> 04:03:44,469
solution even even if the example
picture looked kind of like what I

9854
04:03:44,469 --> 04:03:44,479
picture looked kind of like what I
 

9855
04:03:44,479 --> 04:03:47,830
picture looked kind of like what I
have so it's like a lot of them said be

9856
04:03:47,830 --> 04:03:47,840
have so it's like a lot of them said be
 

9857
04:03:47,840 --> 04:03:49,630
have so it's like a lot of them said be
careful it might not work so maybe get a

9858
04:03:49,630 --> 04:03:49,640
careful it might not work so maybe get a
 

9859
04:03:49,640 --> 04:03:53,349
careful it might not work so maybe get a
professional to do it I'm like H should

9860
04:03:53,349 --> 04:03:53,359
professional to do it I'm like H should
 

9861
04:03:53,359 --> 04:03:55,670
professional to do it I'm like H should
I really maybe the landlord also just

9862
04:03:55,670 --> 04:03:55,680
I really maybe the landlord also just
 

9863
04:03:55,680 --> 04:03:58,910
I really maybe the landlord also just
won't notice it I don't know if I want

9864
04:03:58,910 --> 04:03:58,920
won't notice it I don't know if I want
 

9865
04:03:58,920 --> 04:04:02,189
won't notice it I don't know if I want
to risk it but whatever just stay in the

9866
04:04:02,189 --> 04:04:02,199
to risk it but whatever just stay in the
 

9867
04:04:02,199 --> 04:04:04,110
to risk it but whatever just stay in the
whole floor and make it

9868
04:04:04,110 --> 04:04:04,120
whole floor and make it
 

9869
04:04:04,120 --> 04:04:07,590
whole floor and make it
even maybe I need to put a l box back in

9870
04:04:07,590 --> 04:04:07,600
even maybe I need to put a l box back in
 

9871
04:04:07,600 --> 04:04:10,950
even maybe I need to put a l box back in
there oh no that's like it's a drawer

9872
04:04:10,950 --> 04:04:10,960
there oh no that's like it's a drawer
 

9873
04:04:10,960 --> 04:04:13,590
there oh no that's like it's a drawer
it's a solid plastic drawer and then it

9874
04:04:13,590 --> 04:04:13,600
it's a solid plastic drawer and then it
 

9875
04:04:13,600 --> 04:04:16,990
it's a solid plastic drawer and then it
has like like a like

9876
04:04:16,990 --> 04:04:17,000
has like like a like
 

9877
04:04:17,000 --> 04:04:18,990
has like like a like
a trash

9878
04:04:18,990 --> 04:04:19,000
a trash
 

9879
04:04:19,000 --> 04:04:20,790
a trash
bag

9880
04:04:20,790 --> 04:04:20,800
bag
 

9881
04:04:20,800 --> 04:04:26,389
bag
lined in it which catches the sand and

9882
04:04:26,389 --> 04:04:26,399
lined in it which catches the sand and
 

9883
04:04:26,399 --> 04:04:27,990
lined in it which catches the sand and
then you take it out like every once in

9884
04:04:27,990 --> 04:04:28,000
then you take it out like every once in
 

9885
04:04:28,000 --> 04:04:31,110
then you take it out like every once in
a

9886
04:04:31,110 --> 04:04:31,120

 

9887
04:04:31,120 --> 04:04:33,950

while you'd need you'd need the floor

9888
04:04:33,950 --> 04:04:33,960
while you'd need you'd need the floor
 

9889
04:04:33,960 --> 04:04:36,590
while you'd need you'd need the floor
type yeah and I guess also I mean I

9890
04:04:36,590 --> 04:04:36,600
type yeah and I guess also I mean I
 

9891
04:04:36,600 --> 04:04:38,110
type yeah and I guess also I mean I
don't really know if that could be

9892
04:04:38,110 --> 04:04:38,120
don't really know if that could be
 

9893
04:04:38,120 --> 04:04:41,269
don't really know if that could be
considered urine because it says they

9894
04:04:41,269 --> 04:04:41,279
considered urine because it says they
 

9895
04:04:41,279 --> 04:04:44,750
considered urine because it says they
the advises said that like if it's urine

9896
04:04:44,750 --> 04:04:44,760
the advises said that like if it's urine
 

9897
04:04:44,760 --> 04:04:48,309
the advises said that like if it's urine
if it's a urine stain then it's very

9898
04:04:48,309 --> 04:04:48,319
if it's a urine stain then it's very
 

9899
04:04:48,319 --> 04:04:51,309
if it's a urine stain then it's very
different from how you would solve other

9900
04:04:51,309 --> 04:04:51,319
different from how you would solve other
 

9901
04:04:51,319 --> 04:04:53,349
different from how you would solve other
stain inste of just like by water or

9902
04:04:53,349 --> 04:04:53,359
stain inste of just like by water or
 

9903
04:04:53,359 --> 04:04:55,910
stain inste of just like by water or
something so I wonder if it came I I

9904
04:04:55,910 --> 04:04:55,920
something so I wonder if it came I I
 

9905
04:04:55,920 --> 04:04:57,630
something so I wonder if it came I I
would say it comes

9906
04:04:57,630 --> 04:04:57,640
would say it comes
 

9907
04:04:57,640 --> 04:04:59,710
would say it comes
from what do you say do you guys think

9908
04:04:59,710 --> 04:04:59,720
from what do you say do you guys think
 

9909
04:04:59,720 --> 04:05:03,189
from what do you say do you guys think
this is logical the humidity that is

9910
04:05:03,189 --> 04:05:03,199
this is logical the humidity that is
 

9911
04:05:03,199 --> 04:05:07,710
this is logical the humidity that is
like coming from the sand into the air

9912
04:05:07,710 --> 04:05:07,720
like coming from the sand into the air
 

9913
04:05:07,720 --> 04:05:10,110
like coming from the sand into the air
and and then into the ground does that

9914
04:05:10,110 --> 04:05:10,120
and and then into the ground does that
 

9915
04:05:10,120 --> 04:05:11,710
and and then into the ground does that
make sense yeah

9916
04:05:11,710 --> 04:05:11,720
make sense yeah
 

9917
04:05:11,720 --> 04:05:14,950
make sense yeah
condensation but then even through solid

9918
04:05:14,950 --> 04:05:14,960
condensation but then even through solid
 

9919
04:05:14,960 --> 04:05:16,990
condensation but then even through solid
plastic layers that's crazy but yeah I

9920
04:05:16,990 --> 04:05:17,000
plastic layers that's crazy but yeah I
 

9921
04:05:17,000 --> 04:05:18,550
plastic layers that's crazy but yeah I
don't think anything leaked like it

9922
04:05:18,550 --> 04:05:18,560
don't think anything leaked like it
 

9923
04:05:18,560 --> 04:05:20,950
don't think anything leaked like it
can't literally it can't

9924
04:05:20,950 --> 04:05:20,960
can't literally it can't
 

9925
04:05:20,960 --> 04:05:25,070
can't literally it can't
leak ammonia yeah it's just a moisture

9926
04:05:25,070 --> 04:05:25,080
leak ammonia yeah it's just a moisture
 

9927
04:05:25,080 --> 04:05:26,950
leak ammonia yeah it's just a moisture
but like so

9928
04:05:26,950 --> 04:05:26,960
but like so
 

9929
04:05:26,960 --> 04:05:29,990
but like so
weird it it couldn't have gone directly

9930
04:05:29,990 --> 04:05:30,000
weird it it couldn't have gone directly
 

9931
04:05:30,000 --> 04:05:31,550
weird it it couldn't have gone directly
through the plastic it must have gone

9932
04:05:31,550 --> 04:05:31,560
through the plastic it must have gone
 

9933
04:05:31,560 --> 04:05:34,030
through the plastic it must have gone
into the air and then into the

9934
04:05:34,030 --> 04:05:34,040
into the air and then into the
 

9935
04:05:34,040 --> 04:05:37,070
into the air and then into the
wood so if it's that if it goes for the

9936
04:05:37,070 --> 04:05:37,080
wood so if it's that if it goes for the
 

9937
04:05:37,080 --> 04:05:39,790
wood so if it's that if it goes for the
air and all that is that that just like

9938
04:05:39,790 --> 04:05:39,800
air and all that is that that just like
 

9939
04:05:39,800 --> 04:05:43,429
air and all that is that that just like
is that still urine or is that something

9940
04:05:43,429 --> 04:05:43,439
is that still urine or is that something
 

9941
04:05:43,439 --> 04:05:48,870
is that still urine or is that something
