yeah so we start with that we'll start

206
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:44,520
yeah so we start with that we'll start
 

207
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,330
yeah so we start with that we'll start
with that we'll put it all into these

208
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:47,340
with that we'll put it all into these
 

209
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,490
with that we'll put it all into these
two so that we get as many of them as

210
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:49,500
two so that we get as many of them as
 

211
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,550
two so that we get as many of them as
possible today and then we hopefully at

212
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:52,560
possible today and then we hopefully at
 

213
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,390
possible today and then we hopefully at
some point hopefully clear the the first

214
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:56,400
some point hopefully clear the the first
 

215
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,089
some point hopefully clear the the first
stage

216
00:07:58,089 --> 00:07:58,099
stage
 

217
00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:00,469
stage
uh so then we can also see the second

time when I played it I I criticized
 

235
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:29,869
time when I played it I I criticized
that the gotcha is not so like what's

236
00:08:29,869 --> 00:08:29,879
that the gotcha is not so like what's
 

237
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,070
that the gotcha is not so like what's
the word

238
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:31,080
the word
 

239
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,550
the word
it's kind of I'm anti not anti-climactic

240
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:34,560
it's kind of I'm anti not anti-climactic
 

241
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,070
it's kind of I'm anti not anti-climactic
but it doesn't build up the hype I

242
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:37,080
but it doesn't build up the hype I
 

243
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,850
but it doesn't build up the hype I
wonder if they did something about that

293
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,430
okay we'll do it until I ran out of
coins maybe and then we can obviously

294
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:58,440
coins maybe and then we can obviously
 

295
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,949
coins maybe and then we can obviously
get more if we still don't have all of

296
00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:00,959
get more if we still don't have all of
 

297
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,050
get more if we still don't have all of
them uh in theory I wonder

298
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:03,060
them uh in theory I wonder
 

299
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,050
them uh in theory I wonder
if I was super lucky and get no copies

300
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:06,060
if I was super lucky and get no copies
 

301
