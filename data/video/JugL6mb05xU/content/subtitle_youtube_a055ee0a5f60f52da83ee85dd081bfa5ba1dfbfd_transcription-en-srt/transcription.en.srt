2139
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:02,589
little bit but it just it doesn't look
too different so I uh in the future for

2140
00:59:02,589 --> 00:59:02,599
too different so I uh in the future for
 

2141
00:59:02,599 --> 00:59:05,109
too different so I uh in the future for
like uh future outfits I sometimes asked

2142
00:59:05,109 --> 00:59:05,119
like uh future outfits I sometimes asked
 

2143
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:07,630
like uh future outfits I sometimes asked
or I always asked them to add a blush to

2144
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:07,640
or I always asked them to add a blush to
 

2145
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:09,630
or I always asked them to add a blush to
the Happy expression at least to

2146
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:09,640
the Happy expression at least to
 

2147
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:12,430
the Happy expression at least to
differentiate it a little bit um but I

2148
00:59:12,430 --> 00:59:12,440
differentiate it a little bit um but I
 

2149
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:15,829
differentiate it a little bit um but I
always had to use like points for that

2150
00:59:15,829 --> 00:59:15,839
always had to use like points for that
 

2151
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:18,789
always had to use like points for that
and then it takes away possibilities to

2152
00:59:18,789 --> 00:59:18,799
and then it takes away possibilities to
 

2153
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:21,470
and then it takes away possibilities to
do uh to use points for other things

2154
00:59:21,470 --> 00:59:21,480
do uh to use points for other things
 

2155
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:24,510
do uh to use points for other things
like hairstyle and so on uh even even if

2156
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:24,520
like hairstyle and so on uh even even if
 

2157
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:26,510
like hairstyle and so on uh even even if
it was implemented once I had to for

2158
00:59:26,510 --> 00:59:26,520
it was implemented once I had to for
 

2159
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:29,190
it was implemented once I had to for
every other outfit I had to use points

2160
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:29,200
every other outfit I had to use points
 

2161
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:34,710
every other outfit I had to use points
to get my blush again so now perhaps the

2162
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:34,720
to get my blush again so now perhaps the
 

2163
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:37,910

default will have the blush by default
 

2165
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,630
default will have the blush by default
in the happy expression and then I don't

2166
00:59:39,630 --> 00:59:39,640
in the happy expression and then I don't
 

2167
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:41,950
in the happy expression and then I don't
have to pay for it

2168
00:59:41,950 --> 00:59:41,960
have to pay for it
 

2169
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:46,270

2691
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:57,030
that's the I would say the the biggest
and most significant thing about 2.0 3.0

2692
01:13:57,030 --> 01:13:57,040
and most significant thing about 2.0 3.0

it and all future outfits will be on 2.0

2696
01:14:03,910 --> 01:14:03,920
it and all future outfits will be on 2.0
 

2697
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:06,149
it and all future outfits will be on 2.0
the previous outfits I don't think

2698
01:14:06,149 --> 01:14:06,159

2699
01:14:06,159 --> 01:14:09,149
the previous outfits I don't think
there's a plan so far to turn them into

2700
01:14:09,149 --> 01:14:09,159
there's a plan so far to turn them into
 

2701
01:14:09,159 --> 01:14:11,790
there's a plan so far to turn them into
2.0 they will stay like that most likely

2702
01:14:11,790 --> 01:14:11,800
2.0 they will stay like that most likely
 

2703
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:14,590
2.0 they will stay like that most likely
but future outfits will be made with 2.0

2704
01:14:14,590 --> 01:14:14,600
but future outfits will be made with 2.0
 

2705
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:16,270
but future outfits will be made with 2.0

01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:39,669
we couldn't
travel so you know we were kind of like

3826
01:43:39,669 --> 01:43:39,679
travel so you know we were kind of like
 

3827
01:43:39,679 --> 01:43:42,550
travel so you know we were kind of like
the only ones who could meet and I

3828
01:43:42,550 --> 01:43:42,560
the only ones who could meet and I
 

3829
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:45,470
the only ones who could meet and I
really wanted to take advantage of that

3830
01:43:45,470 --> 01:43:45,480
really wanted to take advantage of that
 

3831
01:43:45,480 --> 01:43:47,510
really wanted to take advantage of that
now mid my impression the reason why I'm

3832
01:43:47,510 --> 01:43:47,520
now mid my impression the reason why I'm
 

3833
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:49,229
now mid my impression the reason why I'm
adding that is because like now

3834
01:43:49,229 --> 01:43:49,239
adding that is because like now
 

3835
01:43:49,239 --> 01:43:51,589
adding that is because like now
impression is also very different from

3836
01:43:51,589 --> 01:43:51,599
impression is also very different from
 

3837
01:43:51,599 --> 01:43:53,669
impression is also very different from
Midway and beginning

3838
01:43:53,669 --> 01:43:53,679
Midway and beginning
 

3839
01:43:53,679 --> 01:43:55,310
Midway and beginning
um Midway impression you know we had

3840
01:43:55,310 --> 01:43:55,320
um Midway impression you know we had
 

3841
01:43:55,320 --> 01:43:59,830
um Midway impression you know we had
some ups and downs and I would say there

3842
01:43:59,830 --> 01:43:59,840
some ups and downs and I would say there
 

3843
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:02,030
some ups and downs and I would say there
was some downs but those were necessary

3844
01:44:02,030 --> 01:44:02,040
was some downs but those were necessary
 

3845
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:03,390
was some downs but those were necessary
perhaps for the

3846
01:44:03,390 --> 01:44:03,400
perhaps for the
 

3847
01:44:03,400 --> 01:44:08,310
perhaps for the
UPS um so I was like I think around the

3848
01:44:08,310 --> 01:44:08,320
UPS um so I was like I think around the
 

3849
01:44:08,320 --> 01:44:11,629
UPS um so I was like I think around the
time when I left

3850
