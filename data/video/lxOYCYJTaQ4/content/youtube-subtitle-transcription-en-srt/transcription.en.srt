forgetting is that the oh wait what's
that free free fre fre

1562
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:31,720

 

1563
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:38,270

free steal item ooh magnifying

1564
00:47:38,270 --> 00:47:38,280

 

1565
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:41,670

glass I would

1566
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:41,680

 

1567
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:44,790

say usually cuz I don't have it

1568
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:44,800
say usually cuz I don't have it
 

1569
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:50,470
say usually cuz I don't have it
so probably should go for

1570
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:50,480

 

1571
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:57,950

it let's go

1572
00:47:57,950 --> 00:47:57,960

 

1573
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:01,470

hey it's it's a blankie then I swap

1574
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:01,480
hey it's it's a blankie then I swap
 

1575
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:04,349
hey it's it's a blankie then I swap
it right what so wait that's what it

1576
00:48:04,349 --> 00:48:04,359
it right what so wait that's what it
 

1577
00:48:04,359 --> 00:48:06,230
it right what so wait that's what it
means right swap the polarity of the

1578
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:06,240
means right swap the polarity of the
 

1579
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,870
means right swap the polarity of the
current shell just means the blank will

1580
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:07,880
current shell just means the blank will
 

1581
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:11,349
current shell just means the blank will
turn into the other one

1582
00:48:11,349 --> 00:48:11,359
turn into the other one
 

1583
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:13,950
turn into the other one
okay does he have a Steely thingy these

1584
00:48:13,950 --> 00:48:13,960
okay does he have a Steely thingy these
 

1585
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,870
okay does he have a Steely thingy these
are are these that's the Steely thingies

1586
00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:15,880
are are these that's the Steely thingies
 

1587
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:19,510
are are these that's the Steely thingies
right do I want to do I want to use more

1588
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:19,520
right do I want to do I want to use more
 

1589
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,710
right do I want to do I want to use more
let's first of all

1590
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:22,720

 

1591
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:27,750

invert and then

1592
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:27,760

 

1593
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,030

should I should I

1594
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:30,040
should I should I
 

1595
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:33,030
should I should I
ah who says he'll Ste that ah man I

1596
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:33,040
ah who says he'll Ste that ah man I
 

1597
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,470
ah who says he'll Ste that ah man I
don't know use the use the phone yeah

1598
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:35,480
don't know use the use the phone yeah
 

1599
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,990
don't know use the use the phone yeah
just in case so this one's this one we

1600
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:38,000
just in case so this one's this one we
 

1601
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,630
just in case so this one's this one we
have three free this one turned one of

1602
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:40,640
have three free this one turned one of
 

1603
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:44,150
have three free this one turned one of
the threee blank ones into a live one so

1604
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:44,160
the threee blank ones into a live one so
 

1605
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,950
the threee blank ones into a live one so
it's for

1606
00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:45,960
it's for
 

1607
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:50,150
it's for
free we'll find out another one mhi mhi

1608
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:50,160
free we'll find out another one mhi mhi
 

1609
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,230
free we'll find out another one mhi mhi
the sixth one is a live round and this

1610
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:53,240
the sixth one is a live round and this
 

1611
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:55,390
the sixth one is a live round and this
is the first one I don't know if you get

1612
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:55,400
is the first one I don't know if you get
 

1613
00:48:55,400 --> 00:49:00,870
is the first one I don't know if you get
to the sixth one

1614
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:00,880

 

1615
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:04,630

ah maybe I should have ejected it

1616
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:04,640
ah maybe I should have ejected it
 

1617
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:07,990
ah maybe I should have ejected it
first then stole his magnifying glass

1618
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:08,000
first then stole his magnifying glass
 

1619
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,510
first then stole his magnifying glass
and checked the second one and then

1620
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:10,520
and checked the second one and then
 

1621
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:13,069
and checked the second one and then
possibly change the polarity because at

1622
00:49:13,069 --> 00:49:13,079
possibly change the polarity because at
 

1623
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:15,230
possibly change the polarity because at
least then we're like further I don't

1624
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:15,240
least then we're like further I don't
