look at all this progress

1250
00:33:21,529 --> 00:33:21,539
look at all this progress
 

1251
00:33:21,539 --> 00:33:24,649
look at all this progress
we're down so far

1252
00:33:24,649 --> 00:33:24,659

 

1253
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:28,669

we we gotta dig

1254
00:33:28,669 --> 00:33:28,679

 

1255
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:32,330

ging is a requirement

1256
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:32,340

 

1257
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:35,269

uh

1258
00:33:35,269 --> 00:33:35,279

 

1259
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,009

what if I don't know Terraria that's

1260
00:33:37,009 --> 00:33:37,019
what if I don't know Terraria that's
 

1261
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:37,909
what if I don't know Terraria that's
okay

1262
00:33:37,909 --> 00:33:37,919
okay
 

1263
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:40,789
okay
admittedly I I beat it before but I I

1264
00:33:40,789 --> 00:33:40,799
admittedly I I beat it before but I I
 

1265
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,529
admittedly I I beat it before but I I
don't really know what I'm doing on my

1266
00:33:42,529 --> 00:33:42,539
don't really know what I'm doing on my
 

1267
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:43,490
don't really know what I'm doing on my
own

1268
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:43,500
own
 

1269
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,830
own
so it'll kind of Be Like Us figuring out

1270
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:45,840
so it'll kind of Be Like Us figuring out
 

1271
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,789
so it'll kind of Be Like Us figuring out
together

1272
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:46,799
together
 

1273
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:50,269
together
and I I've I've done a bit of research

1274
00:33:50,269 --> 00:33:50,279
and I I've I've done a bit of research
 

1275
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:53,450
and I I've I've done a bit of research
so I can hopefully be decent

1276
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:53,460
so I can hopefully be decent
 

1277
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:56,029
so I can hopefully be decent
a decent guide

1278
00:33:56,029 --> 00:33:56,039
a decent guide
 

1279
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:58,370
a decent guide
yeah I'm trying to get back home right

1280
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:58,380
yeah I'm trying to get back home right
 

1281
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:01,789
yeah I'm trying to get back home right
now actually is what's happening

1282
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:01,799
now actually is what's happening
 

1283
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:06,590
now actually is what's happening
totally 100 percent

1284
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:06,600

 

1285
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,329

now would we make it to Hell very fast

1286
00:34:08,329 --> 00:34:08,339
now would we make it to Hell very fast
 

1287
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:10,550
now would we make it to Hell very fast
if we just dug straight down yes and

1288
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:10,560
if we just dug straight down yes and
 

1289
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,810
if we just dug straight down yes and
that would be great because we would get

1290
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:11,820
that would be great because we would get
 

1291
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:14,329
that would be great because we would get
a hellevator but however our purpose

1292
00:34:14,329 --> 00:34:14,339
a hellevator but however our purpose
 

1293

but I'm I'm hoping to run naturally into

1422
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:33,660
but I'm I'm hoping to run naturally into
 

1423
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,270
but I'm I'm hoping to run naturally into
a biome

1424
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:35,280
a biome
 

1425
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,150
a biome
hopefully before too long uh or not even

1426
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:38,160
hopefully before too long uh or not even
 

1427
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,030
hopefully before too long uh or not even
necessarily uh oh oh we got Noir

1428
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:41,040
necessarily uh oh oh we got Noir
 

1429
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,390
necessarily uh oh oh we got Noir
let's see there's gotta be more look at

1430
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:44,400
let's see there's gotta be more look at
 

1431
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,930
let's see there's gotta be more look at
that we've got lead

1432
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:47,940

 

1433
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:50,089

I don't think lead is a fantastic ore or

1434
00:37:50,089 --> 00:37:50,099
I don't think lead is a fantastic ore or
 

1435
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:51,530
I don't think lead is a fantastic ore or
anything but

1436
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:51,540
anything but
 

1437
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,329
anything but
better than nothing

1438
00:37:53,329 --> 00:37:53,339
better than nothing
 

1439
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:56,210
better than nothing
better better than nothing

1440
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:56,220
better better than nothing
 

1441
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,890
better better than nothing
I'm just gonna go this way for a little

1442
00:37:57,890 --> 00:37:57,900
I'm just gonna go this way for a little
 

1443
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,050
I'm just gonna go this way for a little
bit see if there's anything else

bit see if there's anything else
 

1445
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,569
bit see if there's anything else
I'm pretty sure lead is still better

1446
00:38:02,569 --> 00:38:02,579
I'm pretty sure lead is still better
 

1447
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:07,310
I'm pretty sure lead is still better
than what I have now

at the top of it
 

1905
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:42,109

01:58:21,410 --> 01:58:21,420
could just literally dig straight down
 

4834
01:58:21,420 --> 01:58:23,390
could just literally dig straight down
to Hell it would still take a while but

4835
01:58:23,390 --> 01:58:23,400
to Hell it would still take a while but

03:16:25,319 --> 03:16:27,110
um also if you pick up the fallen stars
it's kind of a similar thing so those

8303
03:16:27,110 --> 03:16:27,120
it's kind of a similar thing so those
 

8304
03:16:27,120 --> 03:16:28,730
it's kind of a similar thing so those
will increase your Mana but the thing is

8305
03:16:28,730 --> 03:16:28,740
will increase your Mana but the thing is
 

8306
03:16:28,740 --> 03:16:31,610
will increase your Mana but the thing is
you need to actually craft them together

8307
03:16:31,610 --> 03:16:31,620
you need to actually craft them together
 

8308
03:16:31,620 --> 03:16:35,510
you need to actually craft them together
um I think you need five

8309
03:16:35,510 --> 03:16:35,520

 

8310
03:16:35,520 --> 03:16:37,190

but don't don't quote me I don't know

8311
03:16:37,190 --> 03:16:37,200
but don't don't quote me I don't know
 

8312
03:16:37,200 --> 03:16:39,650
but don't don't quote me I don't know
anything

8313
03:16:39,650 --> 03:16:39,660

 

8314
03:16:39,660 --> 03:16:41,809

so if you get five fallen stars craft

8315
03:16:41,809 --> 03:16:41,819
so if you get five fallen stars craft
 

8316
03:16:41,819 --> 03:16:46,269
so if you get five fallen stars craft
them together and then eat it

8317
03:16:46,269 --> 03:16:46,279

 

8318
03:16:46,279 --> 03:16:49,130

do they just fall from the sky Yeah so

8319
03:16:49,130 --> 03:16:49,140
do they just fall from the sky Yeah so
 

8320
03:16:49,140 --> 03:16:50,450
do they just fall from the sky Yeah so
basically when you run around at night

8321
03:16:50,450 --> 03:16:50,460
basically when you run around at night
 

8322
03:16:50,460 --> 03:16:52,010
basically when you run around at night
they'll disappear in the morning not

8323
03:16:52,010 --> 03:16:52,020
they'll disappear in the morning not
 

8324
03:16:52,020 --> 03:16:53,269
they'll disappear in the morning not
from your inventory if you've picked

8325
03:16:53,269 --> 03:16:53,279
from your inventory if you've picked
 

8326
03:16:53,279 --> 03:16:54,469
from your inventory if you've picked
them up but they'll disappear from the

8327
03:16:54,469 --> 03:16:54,479
them up but they'll disappear from the
 

8328
03:16:54,479 --> 03:16:56,269
them up but they'll disappear from the
ground in the morning

8329
03:16:56,269 --> 03:16:56,279
ground in the morning
 

8330
03:16:56,279 --> 03:16:57,349
ground in the morning
um

8331
03:16:57,349 --> 03:16:57,359
um
 

8332
03:16:57,359 --> 03:16:59,630
um
so it's it's crucial sometimes to go out

8333
03:16:59,630 --> 03:16:59,640
so it's it's crucial sometimes to go out
 

8334
03:16:59,640 --> 03:17:01,070
so it's it's crucial sometimes to go out

a lot of people have been thinking that
uh we get along maybe a little bit too

8683
03:25:09,889 --> 03:25:09,899
uh we get along maybe a little bit too
 

8684
03:25:09,899 --> 03:25:13,490
uh we get along maybe a little bit too
well so um obviously I mean that's one

8685
03:25:13,490 --> 03:25:13,500
well so um obviously I mean that's one
 

8686
03:25:13,500 --> 03:25:15,110

of the reasons I like Kiara is because

8687
03:25:15,110 --> 03:25:15,120
of the reasons I like Kiara is because
 

8688
03:25:15,120 --> 03:25:18,050
of the reasons I like Kiara is because
when I watched her streams uh pre-debut

8689
03:25:18,050 --> 03:25:18,060
when I watched her streams uh pre-debut
 

8690
03:25:18,060 --> 03:25:19,429

so I I guess it makes sense that we are
similar minded people but I'm sure there

03:25:27,170 --> 03:25:27,180
similar minded people but I'm sure there
 

8698
03:25:27,180 --> 03:25:29,150
similar minded people but I'm sure there
are some things we don't agree on but so

8699
03:25:29,150 --> 03:25:29,160
are some things we don't agree on but so

8706
03:25:36,000 --> 03:25:38,150
seeing how we both mutually feel about
them if we have any separate interests

8707
03:25:38,150 --> 03:25:38,160
them if we have any separate interests
 

8708
03:25:38,160 --> 03:25:39,590
them if we have any separate interests
if we have things that maybe the other

8709
03:25:39,590 --> 03:25:39,600
if we have things that maybe the other
 

8710
03:25:39,600 --> 03:25:41,990
if we have things that maybe the other
likes that the other doesn't

yeah oh

9137
03:35:51,590 --> 03:35:51,600

 

9138
03:35:51,600 --> 03:35:59,510

now you can pick up some stuff here

9139
03:35:59,510 --> 03:35:59,520

 

9140
03:35:59,520 --> 03:36:01,550

and I'm just gonna

9141
03:36:01,550 --> 03:36:01,560
and I'm just gonna
 

9142
03:36:01,560 --> 03:36:02,330
and I'm just gonna
um

9143
03:36:02,330 --> 03:36:02,340
um
 

9144
03:36:02,340 --> 03:36:04,550
um
so here's one thing about this area Okay

9145
03:36:04,550 --> 03:36:04,560
so here's one thing about this area Okay
 

9146
03:36:04,560 --> 03:36:07,370
so here's one thing about this area Okay
uh this cursed area here if you pick up

9147
03:36:07,370 --> 03:36:07,380
uh this cursed area here if you pick up
 

9148
03:36:07,380 --> 03:36:08,870
uh this cursed area here if you pick up
any blocks from it even though I know

9149
03:36:08,870 --> 03:36:08,880
any blocks from it even though I know
 

9150
03:36:08,880 --> 03:36:10,910
any blocks from it even though I know
they're pretty do not put them anywhere

9151
03:36:10,910 --> 03:36:10,920
they're pretty do not put them anywhere
 

9152
03:36:10,920 --> 03:36:12,950
they're pretty do not put them anywhere
else because the issue with this is it

9153
03:36:12,950 --> 03:36:12,960
else because the issue with this is it
 

9154
03:36:12,960 --> 03:36:14,889
else because the issue with this is it
spreads okay

9155
03:36:14,889 --> 03:36:14,899
spreads okay
 

9156
03:36:14,899 --> 03:36:18,110
spreads okay
so if it's connected to anything else it

9157
03:36:18,110 --> 03:36:18,120
so if it's connected to anything else it
 

9158
03:36:18,120 --> 03:36:20,210
so if it's connected to anything else it
will spread

9159
03:36:20,210 --> 03:36:20,220
will spread
 

9160
03:36:20,220 --> 03:36:22,790
will spread
which is ugly and sucks and that's one

9161
03:36:22,790 --> 03:36:22,800
which is ugly and sucks and that's one
 

9162
03:36:22,800 --> 03:36:24,650
which is ugly and sucks and that's one
of the issues with the corruption there

9163
03:36:24,650 --> 03:36:24,660
of the issues with the corruption there
 

9164
03:36:24,660 --> 03:36:26,090
of the issues with the corruption there
will be a way that we can kind of Mega

9165
03:36:26,090 --> 03:36:26,100
will be a way that we can kind of Mega
 

9166
03:36:26,100 --> 03:36:28,670
will be a way that we can kind of Mega
clear it kind of fast but um it's best

9167
03:36:28,670 --> 03:36:28,680
clear it kind of fast but um it's best
 

9168
03:36:28,680 --> 03:36:30,830
clear it kind of fast but um it's best
to kind of try and get it under control

9169
03:36:30,830 --> 03:36:30,840
to kind of try and get it under control
 

9170
03:36:30,840 --> 03:36:33,110
to kind of try and get it under control
and easy mode in my opinion

9171
03:36:33,110 --> 03:36:33,120
and easy mode in my opinion
 

9172
03:36:33,120 --> 03:36:35,389
and easy mode in my opinion
um or not in Easy Mode but before you go

9173
03:36:35,389 --> 03:36:35,399
um or not in Easy Mode but before you go
 

9174
03:36:35,399 --> 03:36:37,849
um or not in Easy Mode but before you go
to Hard Mode rather

9175
03:36:37,849 --> 03:36:37,859
to Hard Mode rather
 

9176
03:36:37,859 --> 03:36:39,830
to Hard Mode rather
so can technically the whole world get

9177
03:36:39,830 --> 03:36:39,840
so can technically the whole world get
 

9178
03:36:39,840 --> 03:36:41,510
so can technically the whole world get
corrupted yeah

9179
03:36:41,510 --> 03:36:41,520
corrupted yeah
 

9180
03:36:41,520 --> 03:36:42,889
corrupted yeah
pretty sure

9181
03:36:42,889 --> 03:36:42,899
pretty sure
 

9182
03:36:42,899 --> 03:36:46,309
pretty sure
oh it doesn't expand until hard mode so

9183
03:36:46,309 --> 03:36:46,319
oh it doesn't expand until hard mode so
 

9184
03:36:46,319 --> 03:36:47,990
oh it doesn't expand until hard mode so
I think as long as it's not touching

9185
03:36:47,990 --> 03:36:48,000
I think as long as it's not touching
 

9186
03:36:48,000 --> 03:36:50,330
I think as long as it's not touching
anything people

9187

through digging
 

9244
03:38:15,840 --> 03:38:18,830
through digging
um but for now we can just explore like

9245
03:38:18,830 --> 03:38:18,840
um but for now we can just explore like
 

9246
03:38:18,840 --> 03:38:22,429

04:03:38,570 --> 04:03:38,580
um because they'll just keep spawning
 

10289
04:03:38,580 --> 04:03:41,030
um because they'll just keep spawning
as long as it's out of and that issue

10290
04:03:41,030 --> 04:03:41,040
as long as it's out of and that issue
 

10291
04:03:41,040 --> 04:03:43,090
as long as it's out of and that issue
then becomes when we are traveling back

10292
04:03:43,090 --> 04:03:43,100
then becomes when we are traveling back
 

10293
04:03:43,100 --> 04:03:45,229
then becomes when we are traveling back
yeah then when we're traveling back

10294
04:03:45,229 --> 04:03:45,239
yeah then when we're traveling back
 

10295
04:03:45,239 --> 04:03:46,550
yeah then when we're traveling back
along the way

10296
04:03:46,550 --> 04:03:46,560
along the way
 

10297
04:03:46,560 --> 04:03:47,870
along the way
um it'll be harder and we might

10298
04:03:47,870 --> 04:03:47,880
um it'll be harder and we might
 

10299
04:03:47,880 --> 04:03:49,550
um it'll be harder and we might
accidentally fall

10300
04:03:49,550 --> 04:03:49,560

04:03:51,170 --> 04:03:51,180
so if we're gonna make a sky Bridge it's
 

10303
04:03:51,180 --> 04:03:53,170
so if we're gonna make a sky Bridge it's

04:07:54,229 --> 04:07:54,239
die for you
 

10453
04:07:54,239 --> 04:07:58,929
die for you
is what I meant to say

10454
04:07:58,929 --> 04:07:58,939

 

10455
04:07:58,939 --> 04:08:01,849

so how do you know this is gonna take us

10456
04:08:01,849 --> 04:08:01,859
so how do you know this is gonna take us
 

10457
04:08:01,859 --> 04:08:03,410
so how do you know this is gonna take us
somewhere is it like the correct

10458
04:08:03,410 --> 04:08:03,420
somewhere is it like the correct
 

10459
04:08:03,420 --> 04:08:04,729
somewhere is it like the correct
elevation

10460
04:08:04,729 --> 04:08:04,739
elevation
 

10461
04:08:04,739 --> 04:08:06,650
elevation
um loud island or something yeah they

10462
04:08:06,650 --> 04:08:06,660
um loud island or something yeah they
 

10463
04:08:06,660 --> 04:08:08,269
um loud island or something yeah they
can be slightly different but the chance

10464
04:08:08,269 --> 04:08:08,279
can be slightly different but the chance
 

10465
04:08:08,279 --> 04:08:10,550
can be slightly different but the chance
uh we have a pretty high chance of us

10466
04:08:10,550 --> 04:08:10,560
uh we have a pretty high chance of us
 

10467
04:08:10,560 --> 04:08:13,969
uh we have a pretty high chance of us
seeing it from here and eat either way

10468
04:08:13,969 --> 04:08:13,979
seeing it from here and eat either way
 

10469
04:08:13,979 --> 04:08:15,349
seeing it from here and eat either way
like

10470
04:08:15,349 --> 04:08:15,359
like
 

10471
04:08:15,359 --> 04:08:17,450
like
um it gives us a better level to like

10472
04:08:17,450 --> 04:08:17,460
um it gives us a better level to like
 

10473
04:08:17,460 --> 04:08:19,090
um it gives us a better level to like
build from

10474
04:08:19,090 --> 04:08:19,100
build from
 

10475
04:08:19,100 --> 04:08:22,309
build from
so that way in the future

10476
04:08:22,309 --> 04:08:22,319
so that way in the future
 

10477
04:08:22,319 --> 04:08:25,189
so that way in the future
it's like instead of having to build all

10478
04:08:25,189 --> 04:08:25,199
it's like instead of having to build all
 

10479
04:08:25,199 --> 04:08:26,389
it's like instead of having to build all
the way up we can just kind of run

10480
04:08:26,389 --> 04:08:26,399
the way up we can just kind of run
 

10481
04:08:26,399 --> 04:08:28,910
the way up we can just kind of run
across and then like either jump down

10482
04:08:28,910 --> 04:08:28,920
across and then like either jump down
 

10483
04:08:28,920 --> 04:08:31,370
across and then like either jump down
um later uh or otherwise where's my

10484
04:08:31,370 --> 04:08:31,380
um later uh or otherwise where's my
 

10485
04:08:31,380 --> 04:08:32,750
um later uh or otherwise where's my
sword why am I having such a hard time

10486
04:08:32,750 --> 04:08:32,760
sword why am I having such a hard time
 

10487
04:08:32,760 --> 04:08:37,630
sword why am I having such a hard time
with this

10488
04:08:37,630 --> 04:08:37,640

 

10489
04:08:37,640 --> 04:08:41,150

ah did you fall oh no

10490
04:08:41,150 --> 04:08:41,160
ah did you fall oh no
 

10491
04:08:41,160 --> 04:08:44,210
ah did you fall oh no
hey opened up the map did you see any uh

10492
04:08:44,210 --> 04:08:44,220
hey opened up the map did you see any uh
 

10493
04:08:44,220 --> 04:08:47,809
hey opened up the map did you see any uh
Sky Islands no but there's a harpy

10494
04:08:47,809 --> 04:08:47,819
Sky Islands no but there's a harpy
 

10495
04:08:47,819 --> 04:08:49,189
Sky Islands no but there's a harpy
so I feel like we've got to be nearby

10496
04:08:49,189 --> 04:08:49,199
so I feel like we've got to be nearby
 

10497
04:08:49,199 --> 04:08:54,050
so I feel like we've got to be nearby
one sometimes that's not the case but

10498
04:08:54,050 --> 04:08:54,060
one sometimes that's not the case but
 

10499
04:08:54,060 --> 04:08:56,269
one sometimes that's not the case but
theoretically they can be higher up but

10500
04:08:56,269 --> 04:08:56,279
theoretically they can be higher up but
 

10501
04:08:56,279 --> 04:08:58,370
theoretically they can be higher up but
um it's easier to build like with vines

10502
04:08:58,370 --> 04:08:58,380
um it's easier to build like with vines
 

10503
04:08:58,380 --> 04:09:00,050
um it's easier to build like with vines
and stuff from here than it is to like

10504
04:09:00,050 --> 04:09:00,060
and stuff from here than it is to like
 

10505
04:09:00,060 --> 04:09:03,050
and stuff from here than it is to like
all the way from the ground

10506
04:09:03,050 --> 04:09:03,060

 

10507
04:09:03,060 --> 04:09:05,330

so it's fine

10508
04:09:05,330 --> 04:09:05,340
so it's fine
 

10509
04:09:05,340 --> 04:09:10,450
so it's fine
please no sir Harpy please I'm sorry

10510
04:09:10,450 --> 04:09:10,460

 

10511
04:09:10,460 --> 04:09:14,689

I'm a bird too I get it

10512
04:09:14,689 --> 04:09:14,699

 

10513
04:09:14,699 --> 04:09:31,309

chicken

10514
04:09:31,309 --> 04:09:31,319

 

10515
04:09:31,319 --> 04:09:33,530

yeah usually not all the time but when

10516
04:09:33,530 --> 04:09:33,540
yeah usually not all the time but when
 

10517
04:09:33,540 --> 04:09:37,370
yeah usually not all the time but when
you see uh those Harpy guys you know you

10518
04:09:37,370 --> 04:09:37,380
you see uh those Harpy guys you know you
 

10519
04:09:37,380 --> 04:09:39,110
you see uh those Harpy guys you know you
might be close to one

10520
04:09:39,110 --> 04:09:39,120
might be close to one
 

10521
04:09:39,120 --> 04:09:41,750
might be close to one
yeah see what's that what's that so I

10522
04:09:41,750 --> 04:09:41,760
yeah see what's that what's that so I
 

10523
04:09:41,760 --> 04:09:43,910
yeah see what's that what's that so I
presume there's a sky island potentially

10524
04:09:43,910 --> 04:09:43,920
presume there's a sky island potentially
 

10525
04:09:43,920 --> 04:09:45,889
presume there's a sky island potentially
upwards that we can't see from where we

10526
04:09:45,889 --> 04:09:45,899
upwards that we can't see from where we
 

10527
04:09:45,899 --> 04:09:48,650
upwards that we can't see from where we
are which is fine

10528
04:09:48,650 --> 04:09:48,660

 

10529
04:09:48,660 --> 04:09:52,729
