1314
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:33,720
800,000 Yen right which is if converted
 

1315
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,670
800,000 Yen right which is if converted
to like Indonesian money it'll be 83

1316
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:36,680
to like Indonesian money it'll be 83
 

1317
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,550
to like Indonesian money it'll be 83
million and so the 3 million will use

1318
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:39,560
million and so the 3 million will use
 

1319
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,270

1323
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,109
uh the wrappings and whatnot and the
rest of the 80 million will put to

1324
00:38:47,109 --> 00:38:47,119
rest of the 80 million will put to
 

1325
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,750
rest of the 80 million will put to
making like 20 units which we will be

1326
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:49,760
making like 20 units which we will be
 

1327
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,750
making like 20 units which we will be
making each unit will cost about uh 4

1328
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:53,760
making each unit will cost about uh 4
 

1329
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,230
making each unit will cost about uh 4
million to make in rupia Ria but we'll

1330
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:57,240
million to make in rupia Ria but we'll
 

1331
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:00,670
million to make in rupia Ria but we'll
be selling them for like five million

1332
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:00,680
be selling them for like five million
 

1333
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,190
be selling them for like five million
which makes it that if we did sold that

1334
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:03,200
which makes it that if we did sold that
 

1335
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,870
which makes it that if we did sold that
then we'll have like at least at least

1336
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:05,880
then we'll have like at least at least
 

1337
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,390
then we'll have like at least at least
okay at least at least we'll have like

1338
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:08,400
okay at least at least we'll have like
 

1339
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,309
okay at least at least we'll have like
uh 10% or maybe even 20% of profit and

1340
00:39:12,309 --> 00:39:12,319
uh 10% or maybe even 20% of profit and

1361
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,550
I ask for like 800 uh thousand yen we
can just multiply that by five and then

1362
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:46,560
can just multiply that by five and then
 

1363
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,630
can just multiply that by five and then
we'll have more uh Bon uh you see most
