03:51:23,510 --> 03:51:23,520
nothing because as a streamer who plays

nothing because as a streamer who plays
games every day you know it's kind of

03:51:26,550 --> 03:51:26,560
games every day you know it's kind of

03:51:26,560 --> 03:51:28,910
games every day you know it's kind of
like you don't really quite feel the

like you don't really quite feel the
 

7497
03:51:28,920 --> 03:51:30,830
like you don't really quite feel the
desire to play games

7503
03:51:37,680 --> 03:51:39,910

tomorrow I think I want to move my

7504
03:51:39,910 --> 03:51:39,920

PlayStation over to the uh to my bedroom

7506
03:51:46,149 --> 03:51:46,159
PlayStation over to the uh to my bedroom
 

7507
03:51:46,159 --> 03:51:52,590
PlayStation over to the uh to my bedroom
TV and then play it in bed if I

7508
03:51:52,590 --> 03:51:52,600

 

7509
03:51:52,600 --> 03:51:56,990

can tell that to crony well but she

7510
03:51:56,990 --> 03:51:57,000
can tell that to crony well but she
 

7511
03:51:57,000 --> 03:51:58,870
can tell that to crony well but she
doesn't I'm just going to say she

7512
03:51:58,870 --> 03:51:58,880
doesn't I'm just going to say she
 

7513
03:51:58,880 --> 03:52:02,389
doesn't I'm just going to say she
doesn't stream as much as I do so she

7514
03:52:02,389 --> 03:52:02,399
doesn't stream as much as I do so she
 

7515
03:52:02,399 --> 03:52:04,990
doesn't stream as much as I do so she
she by far doesn't play games as much on

7516
03:52:04,990 --> 03:52:05,000
she by far doesn't play games as much on
 

7517
03:52:05,000 --> 03:52:07,110
she by far doesn't play games as much on
stream as I do so I think that's still a

7518
03:52:07,110 --> 03:52:07,120
stream as I do so I think that's still a
 

7519
03:52:07,120 --> 03:52:10,269
stream as I do so I think that's still a
big difference if I wouldn't stream that

7520
03:52:10,269 --> 03:52:10,279
big difference if I wouldn't stream that
 

7521
03:52:10,279 --> 03:52:12,429
big difference if I wouldn't stream that
much not trying to roast her okay I

7522
03:52:12,429 --> 03:52:12,439
much not trying to roast her okay I
 

7523
03:52:12,439 --> 03:52:15,189
much not trying to roast her okay I
think it's cool that she um you know

7524
03:52:15,189 --> 03:52:15,199
think it's cool that she um you know
 

7525
03:52:15,199 --> 03:52:18,030
think it's cool that she um you know
takes time for herself and all that I I

7526
03:52:18,030 --> 03:52:18,040
takes time for herself and all that I I
 

7527
03:52:18,040 --> 03:52:23,389
takes time for herself and all that I I
wish I wouldn't feel so um I mean I

7528
03:52:23,389 --> 03:52:23,399
wish I wouldn't feel so um I mean I
 

7529
03:52:23,399 --> 03:52:26,349
wish I wouldn't feel so um I mean I
there's part of me who feels like I am

7530
03:52:26,349 --> 03:52:26,359
there's part of me who feels like I am
 

7531
03:52:26,359 --> 03:52:28,349
there's part of me who feels like I am
obligated to stream this much you know

obligated to stream this much you know
 

7533

03:52:30,600 --> 03:52:32,870
but then there's another part of me who
of course enjoys all of this and I want

7536
03:52:32,870 --> 03:52:32,880

7541
03:52:39,560 --> 03:52:41,030
am so I'm not complaining you know but
if I were to stream less I would

7542
03:52:41,030 --> 03:52:41,040
if I were to stream less I would
 

7543
03:52:41,040 --> 03:52:43,110
if I were to stream less I would
probably be able to play more games

7544
03:52:43,110 --> 03:52:43,120
probably be able to play more games
 

7545
03:52:43,120 --> 03:52:45,870
probably be able to play more games

04:02:11,910 --> 04:02:11,920
um just a few tiny rough patches but
 

7939
04:02:11,920 --> 04:02:13,630
um just a few tiny rough patches but
overall it was much better than last

7951
04:02:24,640 --> 04:02:29,469

finish it in one stream I think doing

7962
04:02:39,750 --> 04:02:39,760
finish it in one stream I think doing
 

7963
04:02:39,760 --> 04:02:42,070
finish it in one stream I think doing
like 3 hours three hours or so would be

what happens what I don't want to happen
 

8007
04:03:40,680 --> 04:03:44,389
what happens what I don't want to happen
is let's say that I have 100% left and

8008
04:03:44,389 --> 04:03:44,399
is let's say that I have 100% left and
 

8009
04:03:44,399 --> 04:03:48,790
is let's say that I have 100% left and
in the next stream I would play

8010
04:03:48,790 --> 04:03:48,800
in the next stream I would play
 

8011
04:03:48,800 --> 04:03:51,269
in the next stream I would play
80% because I didn't know there was only

8012
04:03:51,269 --> 04:03:51,279
80% because I didn't know there was only
 

8013
04:03:51,279 --> 04:03:54,830
80% because I didn't know there was only
20% left and I didn't you know separate

8014
04:03:54,830 --> 04:03:54,840
20% left and I didn't you know separate
 

8015
04:03:54,840 --> 04:03:57,110
20% left and I didn't you know separate
it properly then the stream after that

8016
04:03:57,110 --> 04:03:57,120
it properly then the stream after that
 

8017
04:03:57,120 --> 04:03:59,790
it properly then the stream after that
would only be 20% would be super short

8018
04:03:59,790 --> 04:03:59,800
would only be 20% would be super short
 

8019
04:03:59,800 --> 04:04:01,030
would only be 20% would be super short
so that's the kind of stuff I'm trying

8020
04:04:01,030 --> 04:04:01,040
so that's the kind of stuff I'm trying
 

8021
04:04:01,040 --> 04:04:03,389
so that's the kind of stuff I'm trying

04:04:23,070 --> 04:04:23,080
out so that the parts are uh a good
 

8035
04:04:23,080 --> 04:04:25,110

length yeah yeah

8036
04:04:25,110 --> 04:04:25,120

8037
04:04:25,120 --> 04:04:27,349

yeah you can always switch your another

8038
04:04:27,349 --> 04:04:27,359
yeah you can always switch your another
 

8039
04:04:27,359 --> 04:04:29,750
yeah you can always switch your another

8045
04:04:38,199 --> 04:04:40,750

8046
04:04:40,750 --> 04:04:40,760
because then the one stream would be so
 

8047
04:04:40,760 --> 04:04:43,269

8051
04:04:45,199 --> 04:04:47,429

like 40 minutes or so because I I
 

8053
04:04:47,439 --> 04:04:50,429
like 40 minutes or so because I I
finished the game earlier than I thought

8054

8882
04:27:05,790 --> 04:27:05,800
or is this too many cats I think I could
 

8883
04:27:05,800 --> 04:27:09,269
or is this too many cats I think I could
manage but if I had the choice I I would

8884
04:27:09,269 --> 04:27:09,279
manage but if I had the choice I I would
 

8885
04:27:09,279 --> 04:27:11,990
manage but if I had the choice I I would
manage less at the moment yeah that's

8886
04:27:11,990 --> 04:27:12,000
manage less at the moment yeah that's
 

8887
04:27:12,000 --> 04:27:14,229
manage less at the moment yeah that's
why I didn't adopt any more cats even

8888
04:27:14,229 --> 04:27:14,239
why I didn't adopt any more cats even
 

8889
04:27:14,239 --> 04:27:17,590
why I didn't adopt any more cats even
though I kind of wanted it but I feel

8890
04:27:17,590 --> 04:27:17,600
though I kind of wanted it but I feel
 

8891
04:27:17,600 --> 04:27:22,070
though I kind of wanted it but I feel
like uh my current two cats there they

8892

like uh my current two cats there they
 

8893
04:27:22,080 --> 04:27:24,990
like uh my current two cats there they
would be probably kind of

8894
04:27:24,990 --> 04:27:25,000
would be probably kind of
 

8895
04:27:25,000 --> 04:27:29,510
