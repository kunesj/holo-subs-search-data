00:33:43,509 --> 00:33:43,519

 

1353
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,889

you need blade water and the Pearl's

1354
00:33:45,889 --> 00:33:45,899
you need blade water and the Pearl's
 

1355
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:48,590
you need blade water and the Pearl's
body Ina has all that stuff yeah

1356
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:48,600
body Ina has all that stuff yeah
 

1357
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:53,590
body Ina has all that stuff yeah
her eyes

1358
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:53,600

 

1359
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,110

and it's in another I don't know I don't

1360
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:57,120
and it's in another I don't know I don't
 

1361
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,850
and it's in another I don't know I don't
know that's what I thought I didn't know

1362
00:33:58,850 --> 00:33:58,860
know that's what I thought I didn't know
 

1363
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,529
know that's what I thought I didn't know
I don't know oh you can do it anywhere

1364
00:34:00,529 --> 00:34:00,539
I don't know oh you can do it anywhere
 

1365
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:03,110
I don't know oh you can do it anywhere
just gotta turn off Katie

1366
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:03,120
just gotta turn off Katie
 

1367
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,350
just gotta turn off Katie
it doesn't go that far okay I don't

1368
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:06,360
it doesn't go that far okay I don't
 

1369
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:11,290
it doesn't go that far okay I don't
think we'll find it

1370
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:11,300

 

1371
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,510

in like five minutes probably is there a

1372
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:14,520
in like five minutes probably is there a
 

1373
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,310
in like five minutes probably is there a
radius like if we know a block radius

1374
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:16,320
radius like if we know a block radius
 

1375
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,169
radius like if we know a block radius
then we can do like a you know a

1376
00:34:18,169 --> 00:34:18,179
then we can do like a you know a
 

1377
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:20,930
then we can do like a you know a
circular sweep yeah I think there's a

1378
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:20,940
circular sweep yeah I think there's a
 

1379
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:23,409
circular sweep yeah I think there's a
limit how far it goes but

1380
00:34:23,409 --> 00:34:23,419
limit how far it goes but
 

1381
00:34:23,419 --> 00:34:27,109
limit how far it goes but
it's difficult the other way oh we can

1382
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:27,119
it's difficult the other way oh we can
 

1383
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,430
it's difficult the other way oh we can
calculate from where you know through it

1384
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:28,440
calculate from where you know through it
 

1385
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,669
calculate from where you know through it
and then we can set it up maybe maybe

1386
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:31,679
and then we can set it up maybe maybe
 

1387
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,770
and then we can set it up maybe maybe
throw another one it didn't go that far

1388
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:33,780
throw another one it didn't go that far
 

1389
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:39,430
throw another one it didn't go that far
because it pinged really quickly

1390
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:39,440

 

1391
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,629

okay so let's go back to the original

1392
00:34:41,629 --> 00:34:41,639
okay so let's go back to the original
 

1393
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:43,490
okay so let's go back to the original
one and then search

1394
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:43,500
one and then search
 

1395
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,889
one and then search
10 to 15 blocks away from the corner

1396
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:45,899
10 to 15 blocks away from the corner
 

1397
00:34:45,899 --> 00:34:48,829
10 to 15 blocks away from the corner
that you know threw it that's so close

1398
00:34:48,829 --> 00:34:48,839
that you know threw it that's so close
 

1399
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:52,669
that you know threw it that's so close
yeah that is pretty close where the heck

1400
00:34:52,669 --> 00:34:52,679
yeah that is pretty close where the heck
 

1401
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:54,889
yeah that is pretty close where the heck
I'm sure we're just missing it it could

1402
00:34:54,889 --> 00:34:54,899
I'm sure we're just missing it it could
 

1403
00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:57,050
I'm sure we're just missing it it could
have broken apparently

1404
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:57,060
have broken apparently
 

1405
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,390
have broken apparently
ah yeah that's true they break sometimes

1406
00:34:59,390 --> 00:34:59,400
ah yeah that's true they break sometimes
 

1407
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,970
ah yeah that's true they break sometimes
right away that was it probably this is

1408
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:01,980
right away that was it probably this is
 

1409
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:05,210
right away that was it probably this is
probably broken

1410
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:05,220

 

1411
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,010

okay I'm gonna group up and throw

1412
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:07,020
okay I'm gonna group up and throw
 

1413
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:11,410
okay I'm gonna group up and throw
another one everyone

1414
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:11,420

 

1415
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:16,450

I'm coming back to Akira's roof or

1416
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:16,460
I'm coming back to Akira's roof or
 

1417
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:20,150
I'm coming back to Akira's roof or
on the roof roof start there again look

1418
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:20,160
on the roof roof start there again look
 

1419
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,390
on the roof roof start there again look

1429
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,750

what what I lost it again it's like a

1430
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:41,760
what what I lost it again it's like a
 

1431
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,550
what what I lost it again it's like a
distance

1432
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:42,560
distance
 

1433
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,230
distance
I don't see anything I was in third

1434
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:45,240
I don't see anything I was in third
 

1435
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,970
I don't see anything I was in third
person so I was looking and I didn't see

1436
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:46,980
person so I was looking and I didn't see
 

1437
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,670
person so I was looking and I didn't see
anything yeah it actually literally just

1438
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:49,680
anything yeah it actually literally just
 

1439
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,130
anything yeah it actually literally just
jumped behind are we all using shaders

1440
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:52,140
jumped behind are we all using shaders
 

1441
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:55,270
jumped behind are we all using shaders
unders yeah it says it went down

1442
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:55,280
unders yeah it says it went down
 

1443
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,490
unders yeah it says it went down
but I I checked in the case you know I

1444
00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:58,500
but I I checked in the case you know I
 

1445
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,770
but I I checked in the case you know I
mean the Kiara's house it's not here I

1446
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:00,780
mean the Kiara's house it's not here I
 

1447
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,210
mean the Kiara's house it's not here I
wonder if it is a shaders thing

1448
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:02,220
wonder if it is a shaders thing
 

1449
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,069
wonder if it is a shaders thing
[Music]

1450

[Music]
 

1451
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,829
[Music]
no I turned off shaders

1452
00:36:06,829 --> 00:36:06,839
no I turned off shaders
 

1453
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:09,410
no I turned off shaders
uh are we right above it

1454
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:09,420
uh are we right above it
 

1455
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:13,370
uh are we right above it
no way there's no way there's no way

1456
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:13,380
no way there's no way there's no way
 

1457
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,470
no way there's no way there's no way
and we then we would have probably like

1458
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:15,480
and we then we would have probably like
 

1459
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:19,130
and we then we would have probably like
dug into it with Amelia's underground

1460
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:19,140
dug into it with Amelia's underground
 

1461
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:22,250
dug into it with Amelia's underground
Subway turns way further that way like

1462
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:22,260
Subway turns way further that way like
 

1463
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,810
Subway turns way further that way like
to the left but maybe we should dig

1464
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:23,820
to the left but maybe we should dig
 

1465
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,130
to the left but maybe we should dig
straight down from where you're throwing

1466
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:25,140
straight down from where you're throwing
 

1467
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:28,130
straight down from where you're throwing
it in Kiara's house

1468
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:28,140

 

1469
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:31,069

under construction you're forbidden to
 

1473
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:38,290
under construction you're forbidden to
use it from now on what

1474
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:38,300

 

1475
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:41,750

I mean try I mean we can try dig down

1476
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:41,760
I mean try I mean we can try dig down
 

1477
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,190
I mean try I mean we can try dig down
but

1478
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:43,200
but
 

1479
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,930
but
somebody says oh it's not a good idea

1480
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:44,940
somebody says oh it's not a good idea
 

1481
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,870
somebody says oh it's not a good idea
it's not a good idea before we saw the

1482
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:47,880
it's not a good idea before we saw the
 

1483
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,630
it's not a good idea before we saw the
pearls though should we there's no

1484
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:50,640
pearls though should we there's no
 

1485
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,510
pearls though should we there's no
nowhere all right let's see I have one

1486
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:53,520
nowhere all right let's see I have one
 

1487
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,569
nowhere all right let's see I have one
too

1488

1489
00:36:56,579 --> 00:36:59,089

okay let's try throwing it somewhere

1490
00:36:59,089 --> 00:36:59,099
okay let's try throwing it somewhere
 

1491
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:01,370
okay let's try throwing it somewhere
else let's go into a flat field like uh

1492
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:01,380
else let's go into a flat field like uh
 

1493
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:06,849
else let's go into a flat field like uh
is there anything yeah my cabin
