for example, where the egg type x was.  I
 

1906
00:53:12,039 --> 00:53:15,509
for example, where the egg type x was.  I
can't remember if it's a big deal, so I made a lot of mistakes in the part where I

00:53:15,509 --> 00:53:15,519
can't remember if it's a big deal, so I made a lot of mistakes in the part where I
 

1908
00:53:15,519 --> 00:53:18,970
can't remember if it's a big deal, so I made a lot of mistakes in the part where I
had to press that button in Fear Fishing.  It's

01:03:34,779 --> 01:03:39,130

Well, speaking of Ad Tales,

01:03:39,130 --> 01:03:39,140
Well, speaking of Ad Tales,
 

2291
01:03:39,140 --> 01:03:40,910
Well, speaking of Ad Tales,

2292
01:03:40,910 --> 01:03:40,920

 

2293
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:44,530

this person's character has a chest shape of about

this person's character has a chest shape of about
 

2295

this person's character has a chest shape of about
23 people.  Since you haven't been here, that

2296
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:48,990
23 people.  Since you haven't been here, that
 

2297
01:03:48,990 --> 01:03:51,760
23 people.  Since you haven't been here, that
girl has really been completely redesigned,

2298
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:51,770
girl has really been completely redesigned,
 

2299
01:03:51,770 --> 01:03:52,870
girl has really been completely redesigned,
and

2300
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:52,880
and
 

2301
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:55,000
and
now has a different character and shape than before.And there's

now has a different character and shape than before.And there's
 

2303
01:03:55,780 --> 01:03:55,790

 

2304
01:03:55,790 --> 01:04:00,130

also that

2305
01:04:00,130 --> 01:04:00,140
also that
 

2306
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:04,380
also that
[ __ ], isn't it?  I was

2307
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:08,039
[ __ ], isn't it?  I was
 

2308
01:04:08,039 --> 01:04:11,079

 

2309
01:04:11,079 --> 01:04:14,310

 

2310
01:04:14,310 --> 01:04:14,320

 

2311
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:15,730


2312
01:04:15,730 --> 01:04:17,950

 

2313
01:04:17,950 --> 01:04:17,960

 

2314
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:21,390

wondering why they decided to use the same type of screw because they thought it would be used for lung cancer, but

2315
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:23,330
wondering why they decided to use the same type of screw because they thought it would be used for lung cancer, but
 

2316
01:04:23,330 --> 01:04:23,340

 

2317
01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:27,140

this is a new departure for Fields.  I wonder if it's a point, because

2318
01:04:27,140 --> 01:04:27,150
this is a new departure for Fields.  I wonder if it's a point, because
 

2319
01:04:27,150 --> 01:04:31,650
this is a new departure for Fields.  I wonder if it's a point, because
Hahn has always been the same, so the

2320
01:04:31,650 --> 01:04:31,660
Hahn has always been the same, so the
 

2321
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:34,500
Hahn has always been the same, so the
good parts of Tales so far are still there, and the

2322
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:34,510
good parts of Tales so far are still there, and the
 

2323
01:04:34,510 --> 01:04:38,670
good parts of Tales so far are still there, and the
anime is sandwiched in the middle, and there

2324
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:38,680
anime is sandwiched in the middle, and there
 

2325
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:41,220
anime is sandwiched in the middle, and there
are skit chats like that.

2326
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:41,230
are skit chats like that.
 

2327
01:04:41,230 --> 01:04:44,340
are skit chats like that.
But it's a classic picture up to that point, and while still retaining the Tales feel, I

2328
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:47,089
But it's a classic picture up to that point, and while still retaining the Tales feel, I
 

2329
01:04:47,089 --> 01:04:49,489

 

2330

2394
01:06:33,170 --> 01:06:35,290

work that retains many of the elements of the new Tales, while also retaining some of the elements of the Tales up to m, so

2395
01:06:35,290 --> 01:06:35,300
work that retains many of the elements of the new Tales, while also retaining some of the elements of the Tales up to m, so

it's a work that I would recommend to people who are playing Nails for the first time.  I
 

2401
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:45,990
it's a work that I would recommend to people who are playing Nails for the first time.  I
thought it was amazing.Of course, I would

recommend it to people who have played Tales before,

Pony is already a game that can be played by two people,
 

2605
01:11:40,690 --> 01:11:44,580
Pony is already a game that can be played by two people,
so the freshness of it

2606
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:44,590
so the freshness of it
 

2607
01:11:44,590 --> 01:11:47,220
so the freshness of it
makes me want to participate eventually.

2608
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:51,240
makes me want to participate eventually.
 

2609
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:51,250

 

2610
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:53,370

It's cute, so it's

2611
01:11:53,370 --> 01:11:53,380
It's cute, so it's
 

2612
01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:56,520
It's cute, so it's
cute, and it's fun.It's because I'm just

2613
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:56,530
cute, and it's fun.It's because I'm just
 

2614
01:11:56,530 --> 01:12:00,780
cute, and it's fun.It's because I'm just
trying to remind myself.Sometimes I get

2615
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:00,790
trying to remind myself.Sometimes I get
 

2616
01:12:00,790 --> 01:12:03,720
trying to remind myself.Sometimes I get
to hang out by myself, so I'll write a report, but

2617
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:03,730
to hang out by myself, so I'll write a report, but
 

2618
01:12:03,730 --> 01:12:07,630
to hang out by myself, so I'll write a report, but
when it's hard, I'll call you big brother and we'll be together.

2619
01:12:07,630 --> 01:12:07,640
when it's hard, I'll call you big brother and we'll be together.
 

2620
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:10,300
when it's hard, I'll call you big brother and we'll be together.
That's how I played it,

2621
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:10,310
That's how I played it,
 

2622
01:12:10,310 --> 01:12:12,830
That's how I played it,
and from there I started to wonder if there

2623
01:12:12,830 --> 01:12:12,840
and from there I started to wonder if there
 

2624
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:15,979
and from there I started to wonder if there
were more games like this,

2625
01:12:15,979 --> 01:12:15,989
were more games like this,
 

2626
01:12:15,989 --> 01:12:19,430
were more games like this,
so I looked it up and found out that

2627
01:12:19,430 --> 01:12:19,440
so I looked it up and found out that
 

2628
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:22,070
so I looked it up and found out that
there was an increasing series, so I started playing

2629
01:12:22,070 --> 01:12:22,080
there was an increasing series, so I started playing
 

2630
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:24,140
there was an increasing series, so I started playing
from there.

2631
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:24,150

2632
01:12:24,150 --> 01:12:25,490
