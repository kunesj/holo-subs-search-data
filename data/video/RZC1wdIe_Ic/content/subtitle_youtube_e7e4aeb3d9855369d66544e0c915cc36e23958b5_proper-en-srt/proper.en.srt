00:00:09,793 --> 00:00:12,029
​​​ ​I didn't know it had that many...​ ​​

00:00:12,463 --> 00:00:18,068
​​​ ​Guess the calorie count​ ​​

00:00:18,535 --> 00:00:21,205
​​​ ​This was way more than I expected.​ ​​

10
00:00:21,205 --> 00:00:23,674
​​​ ​Extra oil, extra firm noodles,​ ​​
​​ ​extra thick broth...​ ​​

​​​ ​Will they be okay eating all of this?!​ ​​

14
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:30,781
​​​ ​I'm feeling famished,​ ​​

15
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:33,083
​​​ ​so yes, I'll have everything.​ ​​

00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,863

00:00:45,863 --> 00:00:48,732

00:00:48,732 --> 00:00:50,567
​​​ ​Same here!​ ​​

25
00:00:50,567 --> 00:00:52,469
​​​ ​Hello! Hello!​ ​​

26
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,371
​​​ ​You girls, over there!​ ​​

27
00:00:54,371 --> 00:00:56,907
​​​ ​Thinking about food all day​ ​​

28
00:00:54,371 --> 00:00:56,907
​​​ ​I want ramen.​ ​​

29
00:00:56,907 --> 00:01:00,244
​​​ ​won't make you into a​ ​​
​​ ​top-class image-conscious talent!​ ​​

30
00:01:00,244 --> 00:01:00,978
​​​ ​Why?​ ​​

31
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:01,845
​​​ ​What?​ ​​

32
00:01:01,845 --> 00:01:05,416
​​​ ​I never really thought of​ ​​
​​ ​becoming one, though.​ ​​

33
00:01:05,582 --> 00:01:07,518
​​​ ​That's beside the point!​ ​​

34
00:01:07,518 --> 00:01:09,787
​​​ ​If you're even a bit​ ​​
​​ ​conscious about your image,​ ​​

35
00:01:09,787 --> 00:01:12,790
​​​ ​then naturally, you'd be thinking​ ​​
​​ ​about the calories you eat, right?​ ​​

36
00:01:13,157 --> 00:01:15,359
​​​ ​To be quite honest, I haven't really​ ​​

37
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,129
​​​ ​thought about calories until today.​ ​​

38
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:16,927
​​​ ​Until today?​ ​​

39
00:01:19,763 --> 00:01:23,734
​​​ ​For this episode, the girls will​ ​​
​​ ​guess how many calories are there​ ​​

40
00:01:23,734 --> 00:01:28,705
​​​ ​in the food that they eat,​ ​​
​​ ​while aiming for a total of 2,023 kcal!​ ​​

41
00:01:23,734 --> 00:01:28,705
​​​ ​This looks high-calorie!​ ​​

42
00:01:25,102 --> 00:01:28,705
​​​ ​Let's pick healthy!​ ​​

43
00:01:26,437 --> 00:01:28,705
​​​ ​All-you-can-eat time!​ ​​

44
00:01:28,705 --> 00:01:33,343
​​​ ​Kiara's onigiri​ ​​

45
00:01:28,872 --> 00:01:32,843
​​​ ​They can choose any number​ ​​
​​ ​of everyone's dishes!​ ​​

47
00:01:30,707 --> 00:01:33,343
​​​ ​Aki's salad​ ​​

48
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,547
​​​ ​But if they go over 2,023 kcal,​ ​​
​​ ​it's all over!​ ​​

49
00:01:36,547 --> 00:01:39,783
​​​ ​Don't trip up at the finish line!​ ​​

50
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:40,951
​​​ ​Stop!​ ​​

51
00:01:42,286 --> 00:01:43,420
​​​ ​First off,​ ​​

52
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,956
​​​ ​let's look at everyone's picks!​ ​​

53
00:01:48,725 --> 00:01:50,027
​​​ ​Most of Choco-sensei's​ ​​

54
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:52,162
​​​ ​are all foreign-sounding foods...​ ​​

55
00:01:51,261 --> 00:01:53,397
​​​ ​They all sound chic!​ ​​

56
00:01:53,397 --> 00:01:54,465
​​​ ​Kiara-chan's menu​ ​​

57
00:01:54,465 --> 00:01:58,535
​​​ ​has quite a lot of fish.​ ​​
​​ ​I thought she most ate chicken...​ ​​

58
00:01:55,232 --> 00:01:56,900
​​​ ​Oh, you're right!​ ​​

59
00:01:58,535 --> 00:01:59,803
​​​ ​Look at the fourth one!​ ​​

60
00:01:59,803 --> 00:02:02,005
​​​ ​It says "fried chicken pasta"!​ ​​

61
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,005
​​​ ​Oh, it is there.​ ​​

62
00:02:02,005 --> 00:02:03,640
​​​ ​Come on now.​ ​​

63
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,076
​​​ ​Let's start with Aki-san's choices.​ ​​

64
00:02:04,174 --> 00:02:06,076
​​​ ​Round 1​ ​​
​​ ​Aki Rosenthal's Calorie Choices​ ​​

65
00:02:06,076 --> 00:02:08,312
​​​ ​Time to start with what I know!​ ​​

66
00:02:06,243 --> 00:02:08,312
​​​ ​Picking high calories​ ​​

67
00:02:08,312 --> 00:02:11,148
​​​ ​I'll start with the tonkotsu ramen!​ ​​

68
00:02:09,513 --> 00:02:13,283
​​​ ​Tonkotsu ramen with English members​ ​​

69
00:02:11,148 --> 00:02:13,951
​​​ ​She went for Kiara's tonkotsu ramen!​ ​​

70
00:02:15,853 --> 00:02:21,792
​​​ ​So I took this picture with​ ​​
​​ ​the English -Myth- girls here in Japan.​ ​​

71
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:21,792
​​​ ​Ate with English -Myth- while in Japan​ ​​

72
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:25,462
​​​ ​This was taken at a certain​ ​​
​<i>​ ​Ichir*n </i>ramen shop!​ ​​

73
00:02:25,462 --> 00:02:29,633
​​​ ​Gura-chan never had​ ​​
​​ ​real ramen up till then,​ ​​

74
00:02:25,462 --> 00:02:30,234
​​​ ​First ramen experience​ ​​

75
00:02:29,032 --> 00:02:30,234
​​​ ​For real?!​ ​​

76
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:33,971
​​​ ​so she was pretty nervous​ ​​
​​ ​about the whole experience.​ ​​

77
00:02:30,701 --> 00:02:33,971
​​​ ​I'm nervous...​ ​​

78
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:33,971
​​​ ​Understandable.​ ​​

79
00:02:32,469 --> 00:02:33,971
​​​ ​You'll be fine!​ ​​

80
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,507
​​​ ​She was like that​ ​​
​​ ​even at the convenience stores.​ ​​

81
00:02:36,507 --> 00:02:37,808
​​​ ​Yep.​ ​​

82
00:02:37,808 --> 00:02:39,109
​​​ ​That's cute...​ ​​

83
00:02:39,109 --> 00:02:43,113
​​​ ​I really love tonkotsu ramen,​ ​​

84
00:02:39,109 --> 00:02:43,113
​​​ ​LOVES TONKOTSU​ ​​

85
00:02:43,113 --> 00:02:47,017
​​​ ​but iekei ramen is where it's at.​ ​​

86
00:02:47,017 --> 00:02:49,853
​​​ ​Extra oil, extra firm noodles,​ ​​
​​ ​extra thick broth...​ ​​

87
00:02:48,552 --> 00:02:49,853
​​​ ​That sounds nice.​ ​​

88
00:02:49,853 --> 00:02:52,990
​​​ ​I treat tonkotsu ramen​ ​​
​​ ​as a fancy beverage.​ ​​

89
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:58,128
​​​ ​I'm guessing it's at 555 kcal!​ ​​

90
00:02:57,161 --> 00:02:59,596
​​​ ​555? Okay...​ ​​

91
00:02:58,729 --> 00:02:59,897
​​​ ​Hmm?​ ​​

92
00:02:59,897 --> 00:03:02,933
​​​ ​The calorie count for​ ​​
​​ ​tonkotsu ramen is...​ ​​

93
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:08,138
​​​ ​Calorie count data does not​ ​​
​​ ​constitute professional research.​ ​​

94
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,169
​​​ ​630 kcal!​ ​​

95
00:03:05,169 --> 00:03:07,271
​​​ ​You're in that ballpark!​ ​​

96
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,138
​​​ ​I guess so!​ ​​

97
00:03:08,138 --> 00:03:10,440
​​​ ​I thought it was at 900 kcal.​ ​​

98
00:03:08,705 --> 00:03:10,207
​​​ ​900 kcal?!​ ​​

99
00:03:10,874 --> 00:03:12,876
​​​ ​Let's move on to Choco-sensei!​ ​​

100
00:03:11,408 --> 00:03:12,876
​​​ ​Round 1​ ​​
​​ ​Yuzuki Choco's Calorie Choices​ ​​

101
00:03:12,876 --> 00:03:16,446
​​​ ​I pick Kiara-sama's​ ​​
​​ ​tuna margherita pizza.​ ​​

102
00:03:14,811 --> 00:03:16,280
​​​ ​Kiara's Tuna Margherita Pizza​ ​​

103
00:03:16,914 --> 00:03:17,581
​​​ ​Alright!​ ​​

104
00:03:17,581 --> 00:03:17,848
​​​ ​What is this thing?!​ ​​
​​ ​Alright!​ ​​

105
00:03:17,848 --> 00:03:18,615
​​​ ​What is this thing?!​ ​​

106
00:03:19,183 --> 00:03:20,150
​​​ ​Now that's an image.​ ​​

107
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,985
​​​ ​That's one way to use corn.​ ​​

108
00:03:21,985 --> 00:03:23,053
​​​ ​My idea was​ ​​

109
00:03:22,085 --> 00:03:26,056
​​​ ​High-calorie pick​ ​​

110
00:03:23,053 --> 00:03:26,056
​​​ ​that pizza had a lot of calories.​ ​​

111
00:03:26,056 --> 00:03:29,560
​​​ ​Th-This one's homemade...​ ​​

112
00:03:27,891 --> 00:03:29,560
​​​ ​You made it?​ ​​

113
00:03:28,192 --> 00:03:29,560
​​​ ​Wow!​ ​​

114
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,530
​​​ ​I made this one during a stream.​ ​​

115
00:03:32,029 --> 00:03:33,530
​​​ ​Looks delicious.​ ​​

116
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:38,001
​​​ ​I thought putting corn on​ ​​
​​ ​the crust would be a good flavor.​ ​​

117
00:03:38,001 --> 00:03:39,603
​​​ ​I see.​ ​​

118
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:39,603
​​​ ​Nice!​ ​​

119
00:03:39,603 --> 00:03:44,908
​​​ ​* Depiction​ ​​

120
00:03:40,037 --> 00:03:42,573
​​​ ​I bought a pizza oven for this too.​ ​​

121
00:03:42,573 --> 00:03:44,408
​​​ ​That's pretty cool!​ ​​

122
00:03:42,573 --> 00:03:44,908
​​​ ​And it turned out really great.​ ​​

123
00:03:44,908 --> 00:03:47,911
​​​ ​I guess it's around... 680 kcal?​ ​​

124
00:03:47,911 --> 00:03:48,879
​​​ ​Mm-hmm, I see.​ ​​

125
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,415
​​​ ​The correct answer is...​ ​​

126
00:03:51,415 --> 00:03:53,817
​​​ ​669 kcal! Amazing!​ ​​

127
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:56,853
​​​ ​Your guess was very close.​ ​​

128
00:03:56,853 --> 00:03:58,789
​​​ ​Next up is Kiara-san!​ ​​

129
00:03:57,387 --> 00:03:58,789
​​​ ​Round 1​ ​​
​​ ​Takanashi Kiara's Calorie Choices​ ​​

130
00:03:58,789 --> 00:04:02,960
​​​ ​I'm gonna pick the beef stroganoff.​ ​​

131
00:04:00,624 --> 00:04:02,359
​​​ ​Beef stroganoff!​ ​​

132
00:04:00,724 --> 00:04:02,192
​​​ ​Beef Stroganoff of Bliss​ ​​

133
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,394
​​​ ​So tempting...​ ​​

134
00:04:04,394 --> 00:04:06,663
​​​ ​I made this with Lui-sama.​ ​​

135
00:04:04,428 --> 00:04:06,663
​​​ ​Made during a Rich Chocolat collab stream​ ​​

136
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:09,533
​​​ ​There's a ton of butter in this.​ ​​

137
00:04:06,697 --> 00:04:10,634
​​​ ​Has lots of butter​ ​​

138
00:04:10,634 --> 00:04:12,803
​​​ ​I think we added a bunch of spices too...​ ​​

139
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:13,437
​​​ ​I see...​ ​​

140
00:04:13,437 --> 00:04:14,571
​​​ ​No roux went into making this.​ ​​

141
00:04:14,571 --> 00:04:17,040
​​​ ​Is that so?​ ​​

142
00:04:15,939 --> 00:04:17,641
​​​ ​We only used fresh ingredients.​ ​​

143
00:04:16,206 --> 00:04:19,676
​​​ ​Made fresh with real herbs and spices​ ​​

144
00:04:17,641 --> 00:04:19,276
​​​ ​Whoa, impressive.​ ​​

145
00:04:18,442 --> 00:04:19,676
​​​ ​I wanna dig in...​ ​​

146
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,379
​​​ ​Have you ever made beef stroganoff?​ ​​

147
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:27,684
​​​ ​Whenever I think about doing it,​ ​​
​​ ​it becomes hayashi rice instead.​ ​​

148
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,852
​​​ ​I can totally see how that happens.​ ​​

149
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:32,089
​​​ ​I really don't have a clue,​ ​​

150
00:04:32,089 --> 00:04:33,624
​​​ ​but I'm guessing 650 kcal.​ ​​

151
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,091
​​​ ​650 kcal. Okay!​ ​​

152
00:04:34,091 --> 00:04:37,494
​​​ ​The beef stroganoff clocks in at...​ ​​

153
00:04:37,494 --> 00:04:39,863
​​​ ​699 kcal! Spot on!​ ​​

154
00:04:40,264 --> 00:04:42,065
​​​ ​Not that big of a difference.​ ​​

155
00:04:40,497 --> 00:04:41,632
​​​ ​Nice one!​ ​​

156
00:04:42,065 --> 00:04:42,866
​​​ ​Thanks.​ ​​

157
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:44,401
​​​ ​Time to dig in.​ ​​

158
00:04:45,068 --> 00:04:49,406
​​​ ​For the first round, everyone went high-calorie,​ ​​
​​ ​with an average of around 600 kcal!​ ​​

159
00:04:49,406 --> 00:04:54,511
​​​ ​For the second round, they will each pick​ ​​
​​ ​two dishes to get closer to 2,023 kcal!​ ​​

160
00:04:54,945 --> 00:04:57,447
​​​ ​Aki-san, please pick two dishes!​ ​​

161
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:57,447
​​​ ​Round 2​ ​​
​​ ​Aki Rosenthal's Calorie Choices​ ​​

162
00:04:57,447 --> 00:05:01,918
​​​ ​Making me pick two​ ​​
​​ ​might make me go over...​ ​​

163
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:04,688
​​​ ​Let's go with Choco-sensei's​ ​​

164
00:05:04,688 --> 00:05:08,525
​​​ ​Hamburg steak, and my own...​ ​​

165
00:05:11,028 --> 00:05:14,231
​​​ ​glass noodle salad!​ ​​

166
00:05:12,496 --> 00:05:15,332
​​​ ​Mmm, alright!​ ​​

167
00:05:15,332 --> 00:05:20,337
​​​ ​You're going for a main dish​ ​​
​​ ​and healthy side combo.​ ​​

168
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:20,337
​​​ ​Yeah, that's my goal.​ ​​

169
00:05:20,337 --> 00:05:22,272
​​​ ​Okay then.​ ​​

170
00:05:22,272 --> 00:05:25,976
​​​ ​Let's take a look at the Hamburg steak!​ ​​

171
00:05:22,372 --> 00:05:25,842
​​​ ​Special Hamburg steak​ ​​

172
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:29,079
​​​ ​Looks quite delish!​ ​​
​​ ​It even has veggies!​ ​​

173
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,515
​​​ ​Is this all homemade, Choco-san?​ ​​

174
00:05:31,515 --> 00:05:32,916
​​​ ​Yes, it is.​ ​​

175
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:36,453
​​​ ​That makes it even better.​ ​​

176
00:05:33,884 --> 00:05:36,453
​​​ ​Nice, nice! Very nice!​ ​​

177
00:05:33,884 --> 00:05:36,453
​​​ ​Yuzuki Choco's homemade Hamburg steak​ ​​

178
00:05:36,453 --> 00:05:37,954
​​​ ​Is that a ketchup I see?​ ​​

179
00:05:37,954 --> 00:05:39,890
​​​ ​It's a demiglace sauce.​ ​​

180
00:05:37,954 --> 00:05:40,290
​​​ ​Demiglace? It is!​ ​​

181
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:42,559
​​​ ​This is the glass noodle salad.​ ​​

182
00:05:40,457 --> 00:05:41,925
​​​ ​AkiRose-style glass noodle salad​ ​​

183
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:44,161
​​​ ​This is one of​ ​​

184
00:05:44,161 --> 00:05:46,463
​​​ ​my specialties, actually.​ ​​

185
00:05:45,295 --> 00:05:47,331
​​​ ​That's nice to hear.​ ​​

186
00:05:47,331 --> 00:05:47,931
​​​ ​The other day,​ ​​

187
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:52,536
​​​ ​I made one bowl of the salad,​ ​​
​​ ​which was way too much.​ ​​

188
00:05:52,536 --> 00:05:56,440
​​​ ​I ended up taking a pic of it in the bowl.​ ​​

189
00:05:54,738 --> 00:05:56,440
​​​ ​And you posted it.​ ​​

190
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,875
​​​ ​Guess how many calories are in each.​ ​​

191
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:01,778
​​​ ​How many kilocalories are​ ​​
​​ ​in the Hamburg steak?​ ​​

192
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:07,117
​​​ ​I'll put it at around 450 kcal.​ ​​

193
00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:09,386
​​​ ​Alright. As for the glass noodle...​ ​​

194
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:11,755
​​​ ​The glass noodle salad​ ​​
​​ ​would be around 180 kcal.​ ​​

195
00:06:11,755 --> 00:06:16,360
​​​ ​Let's check the Hamburg steak first.​ ​​

196
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,096
​​​ ​It clocks in at 350 kcal!​ ​​

197
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,665
​​​ ​It's healthier than I thought!​ ​​

198
00:06:21,665 --> 00:06:24,201
​​​ ​As for the glass noodle salad...​ ​​

199
00:06:24,201 --> 00:06:27,037
​​​ ​it's at 99 kcal! It's not a lot!​ ​​

200
00:06:25,602 --> 00:06:27,037
​​​ ​That's low!​ ​​

201
00:06:27,037 --> 00:06:29,873
​​​ ​AkiRose's guess​ ​​

202
00:06:27,037 --> 00:06:29,873
​​​ ​Actual answer​ ​​

203
00:06:27,037 --> 00:06:29,873
​​​ ​That's a huge gap...​ ​​

204
00:06:28,505 --> 00:06:29,873
​​​ ​It kinda is.​ ​​

205
00:06:29,873 --> 00:06:33,009
​​​ ​Aki-san has racked up 1,079 kcal!​ ​​

206
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:34,077
​​​ ​I feel like​ ​​

207
00:06:34,077 --> 00:06:35,879
​​​ ​I can push a bit harder for this one.​ ​​

208
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:39,616
​​​ ​I pick Aki-sama's​ ​​
​​ ​beef and veggie chop suey rice​ ​​

209
00:06:39,616 --> 00:06:42,185
​​​ ​and my own eggplant bolognese.​ ​​

210
00:06:42,185 --> 00:06:43,553
​​​ ​Sounds good.​ ​​

211
00:06:43,553 --> 00:06:46,590
​​​ ​A real garden of carbs and meat.​ ​​

212
00:06:43,553 --> 00:06:46,590
​​​ ​\{Restaurant Eggplant Bolognese​ ​​
​​ ​Much Yum Beef Chop Suey Rice!​ ​​

​​​ ​Much Yum Beef Chop Suey Rice!​ ​​

218

​​​ ​Oh dear, this looks like a calorie bomb!​ ​​

219
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,162
​​​ ​Wait, hold on.​ ​​

220
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:54,965
​​​ ​This was way more than I expected.​ ​​

221
00:06:53,397 --> 00:06:55,766
​​​ ​It certainly is a lot.​ ​​

222
00:06:55,766 --> 00:06:56,666
​​​ ​For real?!​ ​​

223
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,169
​​​ ​Is this one also homemade?​ ​​

224
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:00,404
​​​ ​Aki-san?​ ​​

225
00:06:59,536 --> 00:07:00,904
​​​ ​So actually,​ ​​

226
00:07:01,104 --> 00:07:05,442
​​​ ​I bought this at a Chinese-style restaurant.​ ​​

227
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,877
​​​ ​Ooh, makes sense.​ ​​

228
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,877
​​​ ​I see.​ ​​

229
00:07:06,076 --> 00:07:06,877
​​​ ​Yeah.​ ​​

230
00:07:06,877 --> 00:07:10,480
​​​ ​I'm gonna guess this is​ ​​
​​ ​around 580-600 kcal...​ ​​

231
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,150
​​​ ​Let's take a look at the next one.​ ​​

232
00:07:10,647 --> 00:07:12,649
​​​ ​Restaurant Eggplant Bolognese​ ​​

233
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,518
​​​ ​Looks really good!​ ​​

234
00:07:15,385 --> 00:07:17,521
​​​ ​Was this at a restaurant?​ ​​

235
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:20,090
​​​ ​This was at a Western-style restaurant.​ ​​

236
00:07:18,455 --> 00:07:20,090
​​​ ​At a restaurant too, I see.​ ​​

237
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:23,126
​​​ ​It was quite a big serving,​ ​​
​​ ​so maybe 470 kcal.​ ​​

238
00:07:23,126 --> 00:07:24,327
​​​ ​Okay, okay.​ ​​

239
00:07:24,327 --> 00:07:29,199
​​​ ​The calorie count on​ ​​
​​ ​the beef chop suey rice is at...​ ​​

240
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,269
​​​ ​695 kcal! Good guess!​ ​​

241
00:07:32,269 --> 00:07:34,137
​​​ ​I didn't know it had that many...​ ​​

242
00:07:34,838 --> 00:07:38,475
​​​ ​As for the eggplant bolognese,​ ​​
​​ ​it clocks in at...​ ​​

243
00:07:38,475 --> 00:07:41,178
​​​ ​642 kcal! That's on the heavy side!​ ​​

244
00:07:40,177 --> 00:07:43,113
​​​ ​Oh wow! That's a lot!​ ​​
​​ ​Aren't you close to going over?​ ​​

245
00:07:42,012 --> 00:07:43,113
​​​ ​Huh?​ ​​

246
00:07:43,113 --> 00:07:44,080
​​​ ​Speaking of which...​ ​​

248
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,915
​​​ ​Her total count is​ ​​

​​​ ​Way too close!​ ​​

251
00:07:48,452 --> 00:07:50,020
​​​ ​Seriously? No way!​ ​​

252
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,489
​​​ ​I would like to stop myself right here!​ ​​

253
00:07:52,489 --> 00:07:54,558
​​​ ​Understood.​ ​​
​​ ​You won't need to play anymore.​ ​​

254
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:57,928
​​​ ​Kiara-san, please pick two dishes!​ ​​

255
00:07:55,091 --> 00:07:57,928
​​​ ​Round 2​ ​​
​​ ​Takanashi Kiara's Calorie Choices​ ​​

256
00:07:57,928 --> 00:08:00,297
​​​ ​I wanna pick something high-calorie,​ ​​

257
00:08:00,297 --> 00:08:04,468
​​​ ​so I'll go with Aki-senpai's olive oil chicken​ ​​

258
00:08:02,499 --> 00:08:04,468
​​​ ​Olive oil chicken and...?​ ​​

259
00:08:04,468 --> 00:08:07,537
​​​ ​and my own galette.​ ​​

260
00:08:05,602 --> 00:08:07,537
​​​ ​The galette!​ ​​

261
00:08:07,537 --> 00:08:10,974
​​​ ​Show Aki-san's chicken thighs​ ​​
​​ ​in olive oil, please!​ ​​

262
00:08:07,704 --> 00:08:10,574
​​​ ​Addictive chicken thighs in olive oil​ ​​

263
00:08:10,974 --> 00:08:14,211
​​​ ​That's what it looks like.​ ​​

264
00:08:12,676 --> 00:08:14,611
​​​ ​This looks pretty healthy!​ ​​

265
00:08:13,343 --> 00:08:14,611
​​​ ​Oddly healthy​ ​​

266
00:08:14,611 --> 00:08:17,781
​​​ ​Take your chicken and fry it​ ​​

267
00:08:16,012 --> 00:08:27,157
​​​ ​1) Fry skin-on chicken thighs​ ​​
​​ ​in olive oil.​ ​​

268
00:08:17,781 --> 00:08:21,017
​​​ ​in olive oil, skin and all.​ ​​

269
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,017
​​​ ​With the skin on?​ ​​

270
00:08:21,017 --> 00:08:27,157
​​​ ​2) Add salt to taste.​ ​​

271
00:08:21,017 --> 00:08:24,654
​​​ ​Then season with salt after. Simple food.​ ​​

272
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:27,157
​​​ ​DONE​ ​​

273
00:08:23,386 --> 00:08:26,122
​​​ ​I can see this tasting very good.​ ​​

274
00:08:24,654 --> 00:08:25,856
​​​ ​Simply delicious.​ ​​

275
00:08:27,157 --> 00:08:31,127
​​​ ​I'll put it at 250 kcal.​ ​​

276
00:08:31,127 --> 00:08:32,562
​​​ ​Here is the galette.​ ​​

277
00:08:31,294 --> 00:08:32,195
​​​ ​Deliciously yummy galette​ ​​

278
00:08:32,562 --> 00:08:34,130
​​​ ​That looks nice.​ ​​

279
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:37,067
​​​ ​Is this for breakfast or for lunch?​ ​​

280
00:08:37,067 --> 00:08:39,269
​​​ ​Yeah this for break― Erm, err―​ ​​

281
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:42,806
​​​ ​I woke up past noon but​ ​​
​​ ​I felt like having a breakfast.​ ​​

282
00:08:41,238 --> 00:08:44,207
​​​ ​Something like a brunch.​ ​​

283
00:08:44,207 --> 00:08:45,442
​​​ ​Was this homemade?​ ​​

284
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,577
​​​ ​I had this at a place in Shinjuku.​ ​​

285
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,078
​​​ ​I see, I see.​ ​​

286
00:08:48,745 --> 00:08:52,315
​​​ ​It was surprisingly filling,​ ​​

287
00:08:52,816 --> 00:08:55,585
​​​ ​so... 400 kcal, maybe?​ ​​

288
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,319
​​​ ​400 kcal, got it.​ ​​

289
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,455
​​​ ​Let's show the correct answers.​ ​​

290
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:01,525
​​​ ​The (salted) olive oil chicken has...​ ​​

291
00:09:01,525 --> 00:09:04,094
​​​ ​287 kcal! Quite close!​ ​​

292
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:06,897
​​​ ​You're almost at the bullseye.​ ​​

293
00:09:07,531 --> 00:09:11,535
​​​ ​As for the galette, its calorie count is...​ ​​

294
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:10,800
​​​ ​Bring it! Bring it on!​ ​​

295
00:09:12,402 --> 00:09:14,738
​​​ ​437 kcal!​ ​​

296
00:09:14,738 --> 00:09:18,842
​​​ ​This brings us a total of​ ​​
​​ ​1423 kcal! Not bad!​ ​​

297
00:09:14,738 --> 00:09:21,378
​​​ ​Current Total Count​ ​​

298
00:09:18,842 --> 00:09:20,610
​​​ ​Still a bit far...​ ​​

299
00:09:23,013 --> 00:09:26,316
​​​ ​Why don't you both pick​ ​​
​​ ​one at the same time?​ ​​

300
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:26,816
​​​ ​Okay!​ ​​

301
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,184
​​​ ​Okay?​ ​​

302
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,184
​​​ ​Yep.​ ​​

303
00:09:28,184 --> 00:09:29,085
​​​ ​Ready, set...​ ​​

304
00:09:29,085 --> 00:09:31,988
​​​ ​Fried chicken pasta!​ ​​

305
00:09:29,085 --> 00:09:30,587
​​​ ​Cotton candy!​ ​​

306
00:09:32,789 --> 00:09:34,891
​​​ ​Aki-san picked the fried chicken pasta.​ ​​

307
00:09:34,891 --> 00:09:38,995
​​​ ​Kiara-san went for the cotton candy.​ ​​

308
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,365
​​​ ​It really is fried chicken over pasta!​ ​​

309
00:09:43,733 --> 00:09:46,002
​​​ ​This one was homemade.​ ​​

310
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:49,706
​​​ ​Compared to the average fried chicken,​ ​​

311
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:52,409
​​​ ​Average​ ​​
​​ ​fried chicken​ ​​

312
00:09:47,404 --> 00:09:52,409
​​​ ​Kiara​ ​​
​​ ​Fried Chicken​ ​​

313
00:09:48,772 --> 00:09:51,308
​​​ ​It does look healthier for you.​ ​​

314
00:09:49,706 --> 00:09:52,409
​​​ ​this one's cooked to be a bit healthier.​ ​​

315
00:09:52,409 --> 00:09:56,446
​​​ ​Does this use chicken breast?​ ​​

316
00:09:56,446 --> 00:09:58,248
​​​ ​I think it was breast, yeah.​ ​​

317
00:09:57,314 --> 00:09:58,281
​​​ ​Chicken breast, huh?​ ​​

318
00:09:58,748 --> 00:10:02,252
​​​ ​Breast + no skin = healthy food​ ​​

319
00:09:59,382 --> 00:10:01,451
​​​ ​There's no skin on it either.​ ​​

320
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,252
​​​ ​So it <i>is </i>healthier!​ ​​

321
00:10:02,252 --> 00:10:05,722
​​​ ​Since it's a pasta, I'd put it at 650 kcal!​ ​​

322
00:10:05,722 --> 00:10:07,490
​​​ ​650 kcal!​ ​​

323
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:07,490
​​​ ​Is it, really?​ ​​

324
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:10,060
​​​ ​Next up is the cotton candy!​ ​​

325
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:09,859
​​​ ​Cotton Candy​ ​​

326
00:10:10,427 --> 00:10:11,695
​​​ ​Ah, it's this one!​ ​​

327
00:10:10,827 --> 00:10:13,930
​​​ ​WataMerino!​ ​​

328
00:10:13,129 --> 00:10:14,431
​​​ ​At the bottom...​ ​​

329
00:10:14,431 --> 00:10:15,365
​​​ ​Hey, there's something...​ ​​
​​ ​At the bottom...​ ​​

330
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:17,133
​​​ ​I can see some meat down there!​ ​​

331
00:10:17,133 --> 00:10:18,268
​​​ ​Yep!​ ​​

332
00:10:18,268 --> 00:10:21,304
​​​ ​This came with a lamb hotpot.​ ​​

333
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:20,670
​​​ ​Lamb!​ ​​

334
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:23,840
​​​ ​That makes sense.​ ​​

335
00:10:21,304 --> 00:10:24,441
​​​ ​It was a collab, after all.​ ​​

336
00:10:24,441 --> 00:10:27,277
​​​ ​I'm guessing 300 kcal?​ ​​

337
00:10:24,441 --> 00:10:29,145
​​​ ​Meat + Cotton Candy combined​ ​​

338
00:10:25,775 --> 00:10:29,145
​​​ ​A total of 300 kcal for everything, okay.​ ​​

339
00:10:29,145 --> 00:10:34,017
​​​ ​Aki-san's fried chicken over​ ​​
​​ ​basil and spring onion pasta is...​ ​​

340
00:10:34,618 --> 00:10:37,988
​​​ ​647 kcal! Pretty much on point!​ ​​

341
00:10:39,155 --> 00:10:43,059
​​​ ​As for Kiara-san's pick...​ ​​

342
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:47,397
​​​ ​it's at 277 kcal! A good prediction.​ ​​

343
00:10:43,326 --> 00:10:47,397
​​​ ​Calorie count data does not​ ​​
​​ ​constitute professional research.​ ​​

344
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,966
​​​ ​Let's look at the current total counts.​ ​​

345
00:10:49,966 --> 00:10:53,670
​​​ ​1,726 and 1,700 kcal!​ ​​
​​ ​We're in for a close match!​ ​​

346
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,537
​​​ ​Wait, wait!​ ​​

347
00:10:54,537 --> 00:10:56,473
​​​ ​We're so close!​ ​​

348
00:10:55,038 --> 00:10:56,473
​​​ ​Almost the same.​ ​​

349
00:10:56,473 --> 00:11:00,043
​​​ ​If Aki-san goes over 300 kcal...​ ​​

350
00:10:56,473 --> 00:11:03,546
​​​ ​Current total: 1726 kcal​ ​​

351
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:01,878
​​​ ​I'd... be out...​ ​​

352
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,979
​​​ ​she'd be eliminated.​ ​​

353
00:11:03,546 --> 00:11:04,981
​​​ ​I would suggest for​ ​​

354
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:10,453
​​​ ​Current total​ ​​

355
00:11:04,981 --> 00:11:07,817
​​​ ​Kiara-sama to go for​ ​​
​​ ​the low-calorie options.​ ​​

356
00:11:07,817 --> 00:11:09,319
​​​ ​That would make sense.​ ​​

357
00:11:09,319 --> 00:11:10,453
​​​ ​Please don't remind me...​ ​​

358
00:11:10,453 --> 00:11:12,822
​​​ ​Aki-san can probably go for two more.​ ​​

359
00:11:10,654 --> 00:11:17,794
​​​ ​Current total​ ​​

360
00:11:11,788 --> 00:11:15,659
​​​ ​She does have the room for extra.​ ​​

361
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:17,794
​​​ ​I might as well pig out!​ ​​

362
00:11:17,794 --> 00:11:21,931
​​​ ​I'll go for the strawberry milk​ ​​
​​ ​and Aki-senpai's mapo tofu.​ ​​

363
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:25,301
​​​ ​Mapo tofu and strawberry milk, got it!​ ​​

364
00:11:25,802 --> 00:11:26,836
​​​ ​Are you sure?​ ​​

365
00:11:26,836 --> 00:11:27,837
​​​ ​That's quite the combo.​ ​​

366
00:11:28,505 --> 00:11:29,939
​​​ ​Ah, umm...​ ​​

367
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,542
​​​ ​Kiara-sama? Earth to Kiara-sama?​ ​​

368
00:11:32,542 --> 00:11:35,345
​​​ ​Is this over 300 kcal?​ ​​

369
00:11:35,345 --> 00:11:38,982
​​​ ​I'll be taking the apple pie​ ​​
​​ ​and oven-baked fish!​ ​​

370
00:11:39,983 --> 00:11:41,317
​​​ ​It's like she's in a restaurant.​ ​​

371
00:11:41,317 --> 00:11:43,286
​​​ ​Don't you want to​ ​​
​​ ​think this through, Kiara-sama?​ ​​

372
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:45,655
​​​ ​Should I? I'll take off​ ​​
​​ ​the strawberry milk then.​ ​​

373
00:11:45,655 --> 00:11:47,223
​​​ ​Just the strawberry milk?​ ​​

374
00:11:46,589 --> 00:11:50,293
​​​ ​I'll stick with the mapo tofu.​ ​​
​​ ​No more milk.​ ​​

375
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,028
​​​ ​No strawberry milk? Okay!​ ​​

376
00:11:52,028 --> 00:11:52,696
​​​ ​I had to chicken out.​ ​​

377
00:11:52,696 --> 00:11:53,863
​​​ ​So do we have any​ ​​
​​ ​strawberry milk available?​ ​​
​​ ​I had to chicken out.​ ​​

378
00:11:53,863 --> 00:11:55,265
​​​ ​So do we have any​ ​​
​​ ​strawberry milk available?​ ​​

379
00:11:55,265 --> 00:11:58,234
​​​ ​So do we have any​ ​​
​​ ​strawberry milk available?​ ​​

380
00:11:58,234 --> 00:11:59,469
​​​ ​A full meal with a drink?​ ​​

381
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,971
​​​ ​Yes, with a drink please.​ ​​

382
00:12:01,071 --> 00:12:01,971
​​​ ​Umm...​ ​​

383
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,941
​​​ ​Are you sure you're ordering all of that?​ ​​

384
00:12:04,941 --> 00:12:05,942
​​​ ​I'm feeling famished,​ ​​

385
00:12:05,942 --> 00:12:07,777
​​​ ​so yes, I'll have everything.​ ​​

386
00:12:06,276 --> 00:12:09,312
​​​ ​I guess she's going for it!​ ​​

387
00:12:06,943 --> 00:12:09,312
​​​ ​No way! All of it?!​ ​​

388
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:11,748
​​​ ​Let's look at Aki-san's picks.​ ​​

389
00:12:09,512 --> 00:12:11,748
​​​ ​Aki Rosenthal's Calorie Choices​ ​​

390
00:12:11,748 --> 00:12:14,284
​​​ ​This one is the apple pie.​ ​​

391
00:12:11,915 --> 00:12:13,650
​​​ ​Apple Pie​ ​​

392
00:12:15,418 --> 00:12:16,786
​​<b>​ ​Oh...​ ​</b>​

393
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,123
​​​ ​It's two apple pies on top of each other,​ ​​

394
00:12:18,788 --> 00:12:20,957
​​​ ​A stack?​ ​​

395
00:12:20,123 --> 00:12:23,760
​​​ ​topped with vanilla ice cream​ ​​
​​ ​and whipped cream.​ ​​

396
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,363
​​​ ​A honey sauce is then​ ​​
​​ ​drizzled on top.​ ​​

397
00:12:27,363 --> 00:12:29,566
​​​ ​Why isn't the ice cream in the name?!​ ​​

398
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:32,502
​​​ ​Let's next look at the strawberry milk.​ ​​

399
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,502
​​​ ​Strawberry Milk​ ​​
​​ ​Recently Addicted to​ ​​

400
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:34,037
​​​ ​Strawberry milk.​ ​​

401
00:12:34,037 --> 00:12:36,806
​​​ ​This has more than it looks.​ ​​

402
00:12:36,806 --> 00:12:41,277
​​​ ​It's the typical convenience store​ ​​
​​ ​strawberry milk.​ ​​

403
00:12:41,277 --> 00:12:43,279
​​​ ​Finally, the next dish.​ ​​

404
00:12:43,046 --> 00:12:44,748
​​​ ​You'll regret this.​ ​​

405
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,350
​​​ ​That's a lot on the plate!​ ​​

406
00:12:44,748 --> 00:12:46,216
​​​ ​Whoa, that looks good!​ ​​

407
00:12:46,216 --> 00:12:47,817
​​​ ​I want to eat it!​ ​​

408
00:12:47,817 --> 00:12:48,551
​​​ ​Once again,​ ​​

409
00:12:48,551 --> 00:12:51,321
​​​ ​I cooked this one myself.​ ​​

410
00:12:51,321 --> 00:12:56,493
​​​ ​The fish sits on top of a bed​ ​​
​​ ​of mashed potatoes,​ ​​

411
00:12:56,493 --> 00:13:00,463
​​​ ​and the stuff around it is zucchini.​ ​​

412
00:13:00,463 --> 00:13:01,831
​​​ ​All of them combined should be...​ ​​

413
00:13:01,831 --> 00:13:03,833
​​​ ​I'll let you guess.​ ​​

414
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:09,572
​​​ ​The shapes of the lemon and zucchini​ ​​
​​ ​look like zeroes.​ ​​

415
00:13:09,572 --> 00:13:12,509
​​​ ​I'm calling it.​ ​​
​​ ​Those ones are zero calories!​ ​​

416
00:13:10,173 --> 00:13:13,343
​​​ ​Effectively 0 kcal​ ​​

417
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:12,509
