because
you know

5500
02:07:00,709 --> 02:07:00,719
you know
 

5501
02:07:00,719 --> 02:07:03,830
you know
um this was this was the plan all along

5502
02:07:03,830 --> 02:07:03,840
um this was this was the plan all along
 

5503
02:07:03,840 --> 02:07:07,430
um this was this was the plan all along
that after iris joined ian we were six

5504
02:07:07,430 --> 02:07:07,440
that after iris joined ian we were six
 

5505
02:07:07,440 --> 02:07:11,830
that after iris joined ian we were six
girls and e er id has two generations of
