01:31:21,189 --> 01:31:21,199
we might have to do a few more b games
 

3239
01:31:21,199 --> 01:31:23,270
we might have to do a few more b games
before but we can see if we can go into

3240
01:31:23,270 --> 01:31:23,280
before but we can see if we can go into

should
 

3251
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:41,790
should
do maybe we should do hard to see if we

3252
01:31:41,790 --> 01:31:41,800
do maybe we should do hard to see if we
 

3253
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:44,270
do maybe we should do hard to see if we
can keep up against hard Bots before

9387
04:19:47,439 --> 04:19:50,630
conclude that I have tried the
game so that's behind

9388
04:19:50,630 --> 04:19:50,640
game so that's behind
 

9389
04:19:50,640 --> 04:19:55,710
game so that's behind
me and you know I could even be part of

reserved for like 900 p.m. so looking at
things we could do until then there

04:54:12,230 --> 04:54:12,240
things we could do until then there
 

10683
04:54:12,240 --> 04:54:16,750
things we could do until then there
wasn't much in that area because the the

10684
04:54:16,750 --> 04:54:16,760
wasn't much in that area because the the
 

10685
04:54:16,760 --> 04:54:18,948
wasn't much in that area because the the
museums would have closed at like I

think

10688
04:54:20,070 --> 04:54:20,080
think
 

10689
04:54:20,080 --> 04:54:24,628
think
6 p.m. or so and the zoo that I was

10690
04:54:24,628 --> 04:54:24,638
6 p.m. or so and the zoo that I was
 

10691
04:54:24,638 --> 04:54:27,430
6 p.m. or so and the zoo that I was
considering was also like closing around

10692
04:54:27,430 --> 04:54:27,440
considering was also like closing around
 

10693
04:54:27,440 --> 04:54:29,708
considering was also like closing around
the time or even at 5:00 p.m. or so and

10694
04:54:29,708 --> 04:54:29,718
the time or even at 5:00 p.m. or so and
 

10695
04:54:29,718 --> 04:54:31,470
the time or even at 5:00 p.m. or so and
considering all of that there was just

10696
04:54:31,470 --> 04:54:31,480
considering all of that there was just
 

10697
04:54:31,480 --> 04:54:34,350
considering all of that there was just
like a big gap between
