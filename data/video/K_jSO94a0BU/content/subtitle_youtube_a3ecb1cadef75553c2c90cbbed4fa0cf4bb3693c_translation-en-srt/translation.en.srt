00:17:25,949 --> 00:17:25,959
on a one-year test visa,
 

464
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:30,909
on a one-year test visa,
but since I came to Japan.  I guess it's

465
00:17:30,909 --> 00:17:30,919

 

466
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:34,390

safe to say that since the coronavirus started, I wasn't

467
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:34,400
safe to say that since the coronavirus started, I wasn't
 

468
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,470
safe to say that since the coronavirus started, I wasn't
able to do anything I wanted to do.I

469
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:38,480
able to do anything I wanted to do.I
 

470
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,110
able to do anything I wanted to do.I
couldn't work at that time,

471
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:42,120
couldn't work at that time,
 

472
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,590
couldn't work at that time,
so instead I was watching Vtubers' streams all the time,

473
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:44,600
so instead I was watching Vtubers' streams all the time,
 

474
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,029
so instead I was watching Vtubers' streams all the time,
and about half a year later, I

475
00:17:48,029 --> 00:17:48,039
and about half a year later, I
 

476
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:50,310
and about half a year later, I
started playing Hololive English for the first time.

477
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:50,320
started playing Hololive English for the first time.
 

478
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,549
started playing Hololive English for the first time.
There was an audition, and

479
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:54,559
There was an audition, and
 

480
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:58,590

up until that point, I had no intention of becoming a vtuber,

481
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:58,600
up until that point, I had no intention of becoming a vtuber,
 

482
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,070
up until that point, I had no intention of becoming a vtuber,
but since there was an audition, I

483
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:05,350
but since there was an audition, I
 

484
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:05,360

 

485
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,590

thought it would be a good fit for the skills I had been honing, so to be honest, I decided to do something else.

486
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:12,149
thought it would be a good fit for the skills I had been honing, so to be honest, I decided to do something else.

see.It's better not to do this
because you're a VTuber.I've thought a lot that if you do this because you're a VTuber, it won't work.

927
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:01,389
because you're a VTuber.I've thought a lot that if you do this because you're a VTuber, it won't work.
 

928
00:33:01,389 --> 00:33:01,399

 

929
00:33:01,399 --> 00:33:04,549

On the other hand, if you

930
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:04,559
On the other hand, if you
 

931
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,470
On the other hand, if you
become a vtuber, you'll be able to do

932
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:07,480
become a vtuber, you'll be able to do
 

933
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:10,710
become a vtuber, you'll be able to do
more things that you can't do anymore, and your activities will

934
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:10,720
more things that you can't do anymore, and your activities will
 

935
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,310
more things that you can't do anymore, and your activities will
become narrower.I see.

936
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:17,110
become narrower.I see.
 

937
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:17,120

 

938
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,950

Even though the history is quite bad, it's only been 7 years, or

939
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:19,960
Even though the history is quite bad, it's only been 7 years, or
 

940
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:23,190
Even though the history is quite bad, it's only been 7 years, or
about 7 or 8 years, so I

941
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:23,200
about 7 or 8 years, so I
 

942
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,310
about 7 or 8 years, so I
think it's still in a period of growth, so I

943
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:30,710
think it's still in a period of growth, so I
 

944

945
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,149

946
00:33:33,149 --> 00:33:33,159
think it will continue to change more and more in the future.  Yeah, now that I
 

947
00:33:33,159 --> 00:33:36,710
think it will continue to change more and more in the future.  Yeah, now that I
think about it, I don't think it's okay to be a VTuber

948
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:36,720
think about it, I don't think it's okay to be a VTuber

holding real events,
but I'm also thinking about the difference between virtual and real.

970

true, but maybe that's actually a good thing in a way.

1083
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:04,960
true, but maybe that's actually a good thing in a way.

1094
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:27,430
wondering if this is going to turn into a song.

Well, I don't know. It

Well, I don't do it. It's a little

1251
00:43:38,309 --> 00:43:38,319
Well, I don't do it. It's a little
 

1252
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:40,069

difficult,

difficult,
but in

the end, you can do whatever you want. Maybe it's different depending on the place.  I

Hacking. It

1268
00:44:16,349 --> 00:44:16,359
Hacking. It
 

1269
00:44:16,359 --> 00:44:21,790
Hacking. It
might be a good thing even if I get hacked. Well, it's not me. It

1270
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:21,800
might be a good thing even if I get hacked. Well, it's not me. It
 

1271
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:27,630
might be a good thing even if I get hacked. Well, it's not me. It
was interesting and interesting. Well,

was interesting and interesting. Well,
there's more, so I'd like to go to this one. The

1274
00:44:31,309 --> 00:44:31,319
there's more, so I'd like to go to this one. The
 

1275
00:44:31,319 --> 00:44:35,270
there's more, so I'd like to go to this one. The
next one is this one. I'm

1276
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:35,280
next one is this one. I'm
 

1277
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:40,069
next one is this one. I'm
continuing to be a vtuber.  I'm glad I did

1278
00:44:40,069 --> 00:44:40,079
continuing to be a vtuber.  I'm glad I did
 

1279
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:44,030
continuing to be a vtuber.  I'm glad I did
that, but today I learned that

1280
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:44,040
that, but today I learned that
 

1281
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,710
that, but today I learned that
being a vtuber is more difficult than I thought, and

1282
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:46,720
being a vtuber is more difficult than I thought, and
 

1283
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,109
being a vtuber is more difficult than I thought, and
that it's better to do things that way.

1284
00:44:49,109 --> 00:44:52,630
that it's better to do things that way.
 

1285
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:52,640

 

1286
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,950

However, I believe that the reason why you continue to be a vtuber is

1287
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:59,589
However, I believe that the reason why you continue to be a vtuber is
 

1288

there are a lot of things, but for example, I

1337
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:37,400
there are a lot of things, but for example, I
 

1338
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:40,510
there are a lot of things, but for example, I
think you were talking about your fans just now,

1339
00:46:40,510 --> 00:46:40,520
think you were talking about your fans just now,
 

1340
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:45,510
think you were talking about your fans just now,
but I think I was able to create a strong bond with my fans.

1341

I appear on the screen in one room,
 

1349
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:03,270
