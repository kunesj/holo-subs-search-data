​​​ ​Let's all do our best!​ ​​

33
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:37,181
​​​ ​Today's holo's Bonjour is a bit rare,​ ​​

34
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:42,386
​​​ ​with members from​ ​​
​​ ​EN, ID, and JP respectively.​ ​​

35
00:01:42,886 --> 00:01:46,023
​​​ ​As your first time here,​ ​​
​​ ​Reine-san, how do you feel?​ ​​

36
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:48,325
​​​ ​I'm nervous! But I'll give it my all!​ ​​

37
00:01:48,325 --> 00:01:50,294
​​​ ​My heart is racing!​ ​​

38
00:01:50,294 --> 00:01:52,262
​​​ ​We talk a lot in​ ​​

39
00:01:52,262 --> 00:01:55,799
​​​ ​Japanese on this show,​ ​​

40
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:02,206
​​​ ​I think this show is a great opportunity for​ ​​
​​ ​you two to show off to the Japanese fans.​ ​​

41
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:03,740
​​​ ​Yeah.​ ​​

​​​ ​Please keep supporting holobirds!​ ​​

46
00:02:14,585 --> 00:02:16,753
​​​ ​Well, as you've seen,​ ​​

47
00:02:16,753 --> 00:02:21,225
​​​ ​we holobirds get along​ ​​
​​ ​with each other quite well.​ ​​

48
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:24,695
​​​ ​Anyways, let's move on​ ​​
​​ ​to our first segment!​ ​​

49
00:02:24,695 --> 00:02:28,732
​​​ ​Random Rapid Fire Interrogation!​ ​​

50
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:34,905
​​​ ​For this segment, the newbie Reine-senpai​ ​​

51
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:41,411
​​​ ​will be pelted with a barrage of questions​ ​​
​​ ​by us, who've been on this show before.​ ​​

52
00:02:41,778 --> 00:02:45,649
​​​ ​Are you ready, Reine-senpai?​ ​​

53
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,618
​​​ ​OK... OK. OK!​ ​​

54
00:02:48,852 --> 00:02:51,922
​​​ ​Then, let's begin!​ ​​

55
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:54,725
​​​ ​20 Question Barrage...​ ​​

56
00:02:54,725 --> 00:02:55,959
​​​ ​Start!​ ​​

57
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:00,831
​​​ ​Please teach us an Indonesian word​ ​​
​​ ​that's easy to use!​ ​​

58
00:03:00,831 --> 00:03:01,732
​​​ ​Mantap!​ ​​

59
00:03:02,132 --> 00:03:03,267
​​​ ​Mantap!​ ​​

60
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:04,201
​​​ ​Mantap!​ ​​

61
00:03:05,068 --> 00:03:06,803
​​​ ​It means "Awesome!"​ ​​

62
00:03:06,803 --> 00:03:08,472
​​​ ​Awesome!​ ​​

63
00:03:08,472 --> 00:03:09,973
​​​ ​What do you like about me?​ ​​

64
00:03:09,973 --> 00:03:11,308
​​​ ​I like how you seem mature,​ ​​

65
00:03:11,308 --> 00:03:14,144
​​​ ​but you also have a few screws loose.​ ​​

66
00:03:12,876 --> 00:03:15,179
​​​ ​"A few screws loose"...?!​ ​​

67
00:03:14,144 --> 00:03:15,179
​​​ ​In a good way!​ ​​

68
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,448
​​​ ​In a good way!​ ​​

69
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:22,219
​​​ ​If you went on a trip with the two​ ​​
​​ ​of us, where would you like to go?​ ​​

70
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:23,854
​​​ ​Uh... Um... Hawaii!​ ​​

71
00:03:24,221 --> 00:03:25,856
​​​ ​Hawaii, nice!​ ​​

72
00:03:25,856 --> 00:03:27,090
​​​ ​A nice choice.​ ​​

73
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,660
​​​ ​What's your favorite JRPG?​ ​​

74
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:31,995
​​​ ​Probably <i>Persona</i>.​ ​​

75
00:03:31,995 --> 00:03:33,730
​​​ ​I see.​ ​​

76
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:34,965
​​​ ​It's fun.​ ​​

77
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:39,770
​​​ ​Describe a holobird member​ ​​
​​ ​without saying their name!​ ​​

78
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,205
​​​ ​Describe?​ ​​

79
00:03:41,205 --> 00:03:42,639
​​​ ​That's pretty difficult.​ ​​

80
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,608
​​​ ​Their hair is long,​ ​​

81
00:03:44,608 --> 00:03:47,010
​​​ ​and they seem sweet, but​ ​​

82
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,780
​​​ ​they have a bit of a twisted side to them.​ ​​

83
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,682
​​​ ​Mumei!​ ​​

84
00:03:51,682 --> 00:03:52,716
​​​ ​Yeah!​ ​​

85
00:03:52,716 --> 00:03:57,087
​​​ ​Your favorite hololive song (any).​ ​​

86
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:58,222
​​​ ​Oh!​ ​​

87
00:03:58,222 --> 00:03:59,022
​​​ ​Uh...​ ​​

88
00:03:59,022 --> 00:04:01,625
​​​ ​"Love Me Love Me" by Pavolia Reine.​ ​​

89
00:04:03,594 --> 00:04:05,529
​​​ ​Please listen to it!​ ​​

90
00:04:05,529 --> 00:04:10,968
​​​ ​Lastly, what 3 things would​ ​​
​​ ​you bring to a deserted island?​ ​​

91
00:04:10,968 --> 00:04:12,102
​​​ ​Let's see...​ ​​

92
00:04:12,102 --> 00:04:15,906
​​​ ​Kiara, and the two birds​ ​​
​​ ​on top of her head.​ ​​

93
00:04:17,741 --> 00:04:19,042
​​​ ​And that's it!​ ​​

94
00:04:19,042 --> 00:04:23,180
​​​ ​That's all the questions​ ​​
​​ ​we had for Reine-senpai.​ ​​

95
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:27,451
​​​ ​I want to go back to that​ ​​
​​ ​holobird question earlier.​ ​​

96
00:04:25,082 --> 00:04:26,450
​​​ ​Me too!​ ​​

97
00:04:27,451 --> 00:04:29,853
​​​ ​I want to hear your description​ ​​
​​ ​of everyone else, too.​ ​​

98
00:04:29,219 --> 00:04:30,887
​​​ ​Oh, yes.​ ​​

99
00:04:30,887 --> 00:04:31,955
​​​ ​Everyone?​ ​​

100
00:04:31,955 --> 00:04:33,523
​​​ ​Okay, okay.​ ​​

101
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,192
​​​ ​A mature lady...​ ​​

102
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:36,927
​​​ ​Who could a mature lady​ ​​

103
00:04:36,927 --> 00:04:38,061
​​​ ​possibly be?​ ​​

104
00:04:38,061 --> 00:04:40,330
​​​ ​She's a mature lady,​ ​​

105
00:04:38,061 --> 00:04:39,830
​​​ ​Lui...?​ ​​

106
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:43,200
​​​ ​but she's has a few screws loose.​ ​​

107
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,334
​​​ ​That's a compliment!​ ​​

108
00:04:44,334 --> 00:04:45,469
​​​ ​It's a compliment!​ ​​

109
00:04:45,469 --> 00:04:49,273
​​​ ​Having a screw loose is​ ​​
​​ ​a compliment in hololive. Thank you.​ ​​

110
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,374
​​​ ​In hololive, it's a compliment.​ ​​

111
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,909
​​​ ​Next is, um...​ ​​

112
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:54,378
​​​ ​Orange.​ ​​

113
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:54,845
​​​ ​Huh?​ ​​

114
00:04:54,845 --> 00:04:55,579
​​​ ​Oh snap!​ ​​

115
00:04:55,579 --> 00:04:57,080
​​​ ​U wot?!​ ​​

116
00:04:55,579 --> 00:04:57,080
​​​ ​My dictionary is lacking!​ ​​

117
00:04:56,413 --> 00:04:58,482
​​​ ​Only orange.​ ​​

118
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,482
​​​ ​I'm sorry!​ ​​

119
00:04:58,482 --> 00:05:00,217
​​​ ​It's Kiara-senpai.​ ​​

120
00:04:58,482 --> 00:05:03,987
​​​ ​Describe me for real!​ ​​
​​ ​Like my personality or something.​ ​​

121
00:05:02,586 --> 00:05:03,387
​​​ ​Idol!​ ​​

122
00:05:03,987 --> 00:05:06,823
​​​ ​She's very idol-like.​ ​​

123
00:05:06,189 --> 00:05:07,958
​​​ ​It's me!​ ​​

124
00:05:06,823 --> 00:05:09,926
​​​ ​She's good at dancing, for example.​ ​​

125
00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:10,927
​​​ ​It's Kiara-senpai!​ ​​

126
00:05:09,926 --> 00:05:11,695
​​​ ​And she's orange.​ ​​

127
00:05:11,695 --> 00:05:12,896
​​​ ​Thank you.​ ​​

128
00:05:12,596 --> 00:05:14,298
​​​ ​Orange!​ ​​

129
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,866
​​​ ​I'm the Orange Ranger.​ ​​

130
00:05:14,298 --> 00:05:15,632
​​​ ​Orange!​ ​​

131
00:05:15,632 --> 00:05:16,767
​​​ ​And...​ ​​

132
00:05:15,866 --> 00:05:17,134
​​​ ​Lastly?​ ​​

133
00:05:17,134 --> 00:05:18,368
​​​ ​Lastly...​ ​​

134
00:05:18,368 --> 00:05:21,571
​​​ ​Her dancing... skills? No, not that.​ ​​

135
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,173
​​​ ​Her stamina is insane.​ ​​

136
00:05:23,173 --> 00:05:25,208
​​​ ​Her stamina is bottomless.​ ​​

137
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,411
​​​ ​Subaru-senpai, yeah.​ ​​

138
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,411
​​​ ​Yeah.​ ​​

139
00:05:26,109 --> 00:05:27,411
​​​ ​Subaru-senpai!​ ​​

140
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:28,345
​​​ ​Yes.​ ​​

141
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:32,382
​​​ ​We got to hear everyone's​ ​​
​​ ​description. I'm satisfied.​ ​​

142
00:05:32,382 --> 00:05:34,217
​​​ ​Reine, what about yourself?​ ​​

143
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,786
​​​ ​How would you describe yourself?​ ​​

144
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:35,786
​​​ ​Myself?!​ ​​

145
00:05:36,887 --> 00:05:39,690
​​​ ​How about Kiara-senpai do that?​ ​​

146
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,158
​​​ ​To be honest,​ ​​

147
00:05:41,158 --> 00:05:43,994
​​​ ​my impression of her changed quite a bit​ ​​

148
00:05:43,994 --> 00:05:48,131
​​​ ​from our Maldives trip the other week.​ ​​

149
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:48,131
​​​ ​Oh? How so?​ ​​

150
00:05:48,131 --> 00:05:52,102
​​​ ​Like, she acts quite differently​ ​​
​​ ​than you'd expect.​ ​​

151
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,436
​​​ ​Wow, really?​ ​​

152
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,839
​​​ ​How so, exactly?​ ​​

153
00:05:53,403 --> 00:05:55,839
​​​ ​For example...​ ​​

154
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,443
​​​ ​She seems elegant in general,​ ​​

155
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:00,010
​​​ ​Uh-huh. True.​ ​​

156
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:03,213
​​​ ​but she also has a lot of cute,​ ​​
​​ ​child-like sides to her​ ​​

157
00:06:03,213 --> 00:06:06,350
​​​ ​Whaaat? I wanna see what that's like.​ ​​

158
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,618
​​​ ​Then, let's go on a trip with the three of us.​ ​​

159
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,120
​​​ ​Let's all go to Hawaii together.​ ​​

160
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,156
​​​ ​You mentioned it earlier,​ ​​
​​ ​so let's go to Hawaii.​ ​​

161
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,888
​​​ ​Hawaii!​ ​​

162
00:06:13,156 --> 00:06:14,691
​​​ ​I want to go!​ ​​

163
00:06:14,891 --> 00:06:18,662
​​​ ​Now for our next segment!​ ​​

164
00:06:18,662 --> 00:06:23,867
​​​ ​Teach Us, Lui-Nee!​ ​​
​​ ​Hot-blooded Talk <i>Ch</i>eminar!​ ​​

165
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:26,703
​​​ ​Wow!​ ​​

166
00:06:25,001 --> 00:06:29,406
​​​ ​This one is my segment.​ ​​

167
00:06:29,406 --> 00:06:37,748
​​​ ​I, Takane Lui, a former top-ranked​ ​​
​​ ​businesswoman in Japan,​ ​​

168
00:06:37,748 --> 00:06:42,319
​​​ ​will teach you communication skills​ ​​
​​ ​with wide-ranging use​ ​​

169
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,722
​​​ ​from business to​ ​​
​​ ​just talking with your friends.​ ​​

170
00:06:45,722 --> 00:06:49,726
​​​ ​With this segment, hololive's​ ​​
​​ ​communication skills will go through the roof!​ ​​

171
00:06:49,726 --> 00:06:57,534
​​​ ​Instructor​ ​​

172
00:06:49,726 --> 00:06:57,534
​​​ ​What to say when you oversleep​ ​​
​​ ​and break a date with your friend?​ ​​

173
00:06:49,726 --> 00:06:52,295
​​​ ​I'm going to throw out a situation,​ ​​

174
00:06:52,295 --> 00:06:57,534
​​​ ​and we'll test whether you can​ ​​
​​ ​give the best response for it.​ ​​

175
00:06:57,534 --> 00:07:00,270
​​​ ​Today, we'll be using a variety of prompts​ ​​

176
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:04,641
​​​ ​provided to us by the viewers!​ ​​

177
00:07:04,641 --> 00:07:09,379
​​​ ​Please focus your attention on the board.​ ​​

178
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:13,517
​​​ ​How to get a friend​ ​​
​​ ​who always lets you choose,​ ​​

179
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:15,852
​​​ ​and doesn't ever choose themselves,​ ​​

180
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:18,822
​​​ ​to choose something first.​ ​​

181
00:07:18,822 --> 00:07:21,625
​​​ ​For example, when you go out to eat with them,​ ​​

182
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:28,598
​​​ ​and you ask them what they want,​ ​​
​​ ​but they always answer, "Anything's fine."​ ​​

183
00:07:28,598 --> 00:07:31,435
​​​ ​So I'd like you two to think about a way​ ​​

184
00:07:31,435 --> 00:07:34,604
​​​ ​to get them to choose something first​ ​​

185
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:39,342
​​​ ​in those kinds of situations.​ ​​

186
00:07:39,342 --> 00:07:42,946
​​​ ​Thinking time starts... now!​ ​​

187
00:07:43,413 --> 00:07:46,316
​​​ ​Are they both answering in Japanese?​ ​​

188
00:07:46,316 --> 00:07:47,717
​​​ ​I'm done!​ ​​

189
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,085
​​​ ​Oh, wow!​ ​​

190
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:51,054
​​​ ​I did my best to write in hiragana.​ ​​

191
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:53,390
​​​ ​It was quite the complex question, too.​ ​​
​​ ​Thank you.​ ​​

192
00:07:53,757 --> 00:07:54,991
​​​ ​My pleasure.​ ​​

193
00:07:54,991 --> 00:07:59,229
​​​ ​And that's it for our thinking time!​ ​​

194
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:02,199
​​​ ​Let's reveal our answers one by one.​ ​​

195
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:04,734
​​​ ​Who wants to go first?​ ​​

196
00:08:05,635 --> 00:08:08,772
​​​ ​Hmm...​ ​​

197
00:08:05,802 --> 00:08:07,571
​​​ ​I'm not too sure about this one...​ ​​

198
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:09,105
​​​ ​Where's our confidence gone?!​ ​​

199
00:08:08,205 --> 00:08:09,773
​​​ ​No one wants to go first?​ ​​

200
00:08:09,773 --> 00:08:13,844
​​​ ​Then, why don't we start with​ ​​
​​ ​the oldest member here, Kiara-senpai.​ ​​

201
00:08:13,844 --> 00:08:14,811
​​​ ​Okay.​ ​​

202
00:08:14,811 --> 00:08:19,149
​​​ ​Let's take a look at Kiara-senpai's answer!​ ​​

203
00:08:19,149 --> 00:08:22,285
​​​ ​"Is there anything you haven't tried on here?"​ ​​

204
00:08:22,853 --> 00:08:26,490
​​​ ​Since we're eating out and all,​ ​​

205
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:29,359
​​​ ​I tried asking them out​ ​​
​​ ​for something they haven't tried.​ ​​

206
00:08:29,359 --> 00:08:32,295
​​​ ​I like the way you phrased the question.​ ​​

207
00:08:32,295 --> 00:08:34,431
​​​ ​Thank you very much, Ms. Takane!​ ​​

208
00:08:36,066 --> 00:08:38,935
​​​ ​I should try that out myself.​ ​​

209
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,937
​​​ ​Reine-senpai, are you ready?​ ​​

210
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:41,771
​​​ ​Yes.​ ​​

211
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:46,076
​​​ ​Reine-senpai's answer is...​ ​​

212
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:49,412
​​​ ​I'll decide something next time,​ ​​

213
00:08:49,412 --> 00:08:52,148
​​​ ​so what do <i>anata</i>, you want?​ ​​

214
00:08:52,148 --> 00:08:54,217
​​​ ​I want to know what you want to eat!​ ​​

215
00:08:55,085 --> 00:08:56,620
​​​ ​That's really nice!​ ​​

216
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,054
​​​ ​So saying something like,​ ​​

217
00:08:58,054 --> 00:08:59,956
​​​ ​"I'll decide next time, so you should decide​ ​​

218
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:03,493
​​​ ​what you want to eat today,​ ​​
​​ ​and I'll have that too."​ ​​

219
00:09:04,528 --> 00:09:08,899
​​​ ​True. If you tell them you'll decide next time,​ ​​

220
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:11,101
​​​ ​it's a lot less stressful for them, too.​ ​​

221
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:11,101
​​​ ​Yes.​ ​​

222
00:09:11,101 --> 00:09:13,336
​​​ ​Let's take a look at my answer.​ ​​

223
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:15,839
​​​ ​My answer is...​ ​​

224
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:21,711
​​​ ​"Since I chose last time, I want​ ​​
​​ ​to have what you want this time!"​ ​​

225
00:09:22,178 --> 00:09:22,946
​​​ ​Ooh!​ ​​

226
00:09:22,946 --> 00:09:26,049
​​​ ​This time, Reine-chan's is similar.​ ​​

227
00:09:26,716 --> 00:09:29,152
​​​ ​It's the same as Reine-chan's.​ ​​

228
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,687
​​​ ​For this, though,​ ​​

229
00:09:30,687 --> 00:09:34,357
​​​ ​there's no single correct answer.​ ​​

230
00:09:34,357 --> 00:09:37,661
​​​ ​Kiara-senpai and Reine-senpai's answers​ ​​

231
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:41,231
​​​ ​were both great, so a round​ ​​
​​ ​of applause for both of them!​ ​​

232
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,068
​​​ ​Really nice.​ ​​

233
00:09:45,602 --> 00:09:48,238
​​​ ​Seems like you do need to get​ ​​
​​ ​all the mature ladies together​ ​​

234
00:09:48,238 --> 00:09:51,174
​​​ ​to raise the bar for communication skills.​ ​​

235
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:53,176
​​​ ​Since La+ isn't here anymore.​ ​​

236
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:56,046
​​​ ​Poopy hehe​ ​​

237
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:53,176
​​​ ​Gehehehe...​ ​​

238
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:56,046
​​​ ​The kids are gone.​ ​​

239
00:09:56,046 --> 00:09:58,915
​​​ ​Here's the next situation!​ ​​

240
00:09:58,915 --> 00:10:00,216
​​​ ​This one's embarrassing.​ ​​

241
00:10:01,585 --> 00:10:05,789
​​​ ​You and your friends​ ​​
​​ ​reserved a restaurant and went,​ ​​

242
00:10:05,789 --> 00:10:08,825
​​​ ​but the reservation date wasn't today,​ ​​

243
00:10:08,825 --> 00:10:13,229
​​​ ​so you couldn't go in.​ ​​

244
00:10:13,229 --> 00:10:14,931
​​​ ​For this, we're the person​ ​​

245
00:10:14,931 --> 00:10:17,867
​​​ ​who made the reservation, right?​ ​​

246
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,768
​​​ ​That's correct.​ ​​

247
00:10:21,004 --> 00:10:23,073
​​​ ​Reine, how you doing?​ ​​

248
00:10:23,073 --> 00:10:24,574
​​​ ​I think I'm good.​ ​​

249
00:10:24,574 --> 00:10:25,275
​​​ ​Wha?​ ​​

250
00:10:26,776 --> 00:10:28,578
​​​ ​I'm done! Sorry for the wait!​ ​​

251
00:10:28,578 --> 00:10:29,646
​​​ ​Okay!​ ​​

252
00:10:29,646 --> 00:10:32,349
​​​ ​Are you both finished writing?​ ​​

253
00:10:32,349 --> 00:10:33,216
​​​ ​Yes.​ ​​

254
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,084
​​​ ​Done?​ ​​

255
00:10:34,084 --> 00:10:36,286
​​​ ​Anyone want to go first​ ​​

256
00:10:36,286 --> 00:10:38,888
​​​ ​this time around?​ ​​

257
00:10:37,821 --> 00:10:39,823
​​​ ​Reine first. Reine first.​ ​​

258
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:42,058
​​​ ​Reine-senpai seems confident.​ ​​

259
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:42,058
​​​ ​I'll go first this time.​ ​​

260
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:45,895
​​​ ​Please show your answer, Reine-senpai!​ ​​

261
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,264
​​​ ​Say "Sorry!" clearly,​ ​​

262
00:10:48,264 --> 00:10:54,237
​​​ ​and then give recommendations​ ​​
​​ ​for some other restaurants.​ ​​

263
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:57,774
​​​ ​Even if your friends say they don't mind,​ ​​

264
00:10:57,774 --> 00:10:59,442
​​​ ​it's still bothersome,​ ​​

265
00:10:59,442 --> 00:11:02,078
​​​ ​so apologizing first is probably a good idea.​ ​​

266
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,314
​​​ ​Saying "Sorry" right away.​ ​​

267
00:11:02,545 --> 00:11:03,813
​​​ ​True.​ ​​

268
00:11:04,314 --> 00:11:09,419
​​​ ​And then suggesting some restaurants nearby.​ ​​

269
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:12,822
​​​ ​Like, "Sorry about this.​ ​​
​​ ​How about this place nearby?​ ​​

270
00:11:12,822 --> 00:11:14,491
​​​ ​It's close and their food's great.​ ​​

271
00:11:14,491 --> 00:11:16,393
​​​ ​How about it?"​ ​​

272
00:11:17,727 --> 00:11:19,062
​​​ ​I think that's great.​ ​​

273
00:11:17,727 --> 00:11:19,062
​​​ ​It's embarrassing!​ ​​

274
00:11:19,062 --> 00:11:22,799
​​​ ​In business you see this​ ​​
​​ ​all the time as well.​ ​​

275
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:27,937
​​​ ​Apologizing first,​ ​​
​​ ​then giving another suggestion.​ ​​

276
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:31,141
​​​ ​I'm impressed at how​ ​​
​​ ​you got that part right too.​ ​​

277
00:11:31,141 --> 00:11:32,609
​​​ ​You pass!​ ​​

278
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,210
​​​ ​Thank you, Ms. Takane!​ ​​

279
00:11:35,512 --> 00:11:39,082
​​​ ​And Kiara-senpai's answer is...​ ​​

280
00:11:39,082 --> 00:11:42,085
​​​ ​Apologizing is a given.​ ​​

281
00:11:42,085 --> 00:11:47,257
​​​ ​After that, have everyone vote on where to go.​ ​​

282
00:11:47,257 --> 00:11:49,926
​​​ ​Having everyone decide together.​ ​​

283
00:11:49,926 --> 00:11:52,762
​​​ ​That ends up being more fun, as well.​ ​​

284
00:11:52,762 --> 00:11:56,499
​​​ ​Turning a mishap into,​ ​​
​​ ​well not a positive thing,​ ​​

285
00:11:56,499 --> 00:12:00,804
​​​ ​but into an event​ ​​
​​ ​is a pretty wonderful idea.​ ​​

286
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:02,972
​​​ ​Yeah.​ ​​

287
00:12:01,504 --> 00:12:03,640
​​​ ​I didn't think of that.​ ​​

288
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,976
​​​ ​Let's take a look at my answer!​ ​​

289
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:07,877
​​​ ​Here it is!​ ​​

290
00:12:08,244 --> 00:12:12,282
​​​ ​"I'm really sorry! I'll find somewhere​ ​​
​​ ​close by we can go real quick!"​ ​​

291
00:12:12,282 --> 00:12:15,385
​​​ ​It's pretty close to what Reine-senpai had.​ ​​

292
00:12:15,385 --> 00:12:18,588
​​​ ​But I really liked how Kiara-senpai​ ​​

293
00:12:18,588 --> 00:12:22,826
​​​ ​turned her mistake into an event.​ ​​

294
00:12:23,226 --> 00:12:27,397
​​​ ​I didn't think of that option,​ ​​

295
00:12:27,397 --> 00:12:29,165
​​​ ​and it's pretty charming,​ ​​

296
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,468
​​​ ​so it surprised me.​ ​​

297
00:12:32,268 --> 00:12:33,870
​​​ ​Thank you!​ ​​

298
00:12:34,938 --> 00:12:37,440
​​​ ​This situation reminded me​ ​​

299
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,442
​​​ ​of something in the past.​ ​​

300
00:12:39,442 --> 00:12:42,112
​​​ ​In my previous workplace,​ ​​

301
00:12:42,112 --> 00:12:45,215
​​​ ​we had a customer​ ​​

302
00:12:45,215 --> 00:12:48,017
​​​ ​that told us they had a reservation.​ ​​

303
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,220
​​​ ​I couldn't find their reservation anywhere,​ ​​

304
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,924
​​​ ​but then I noticed that they had​ ​​
​​ ​a reservation for that day a year later.​ ​​

305
00:12:53,156 --> 00:12:54,924
​​​ ​A year later?!​ ​​

306
00:12:54,924 --> 00:12:57,127
​​​ ​They seemed really embarrassed.​ ​​

307
00:12:57,127 --> 00:12:58,595
​​​ ​That was really stressful.​ ​​

308
00:12:58,595 --> 00:13:00,797
​​​ ​It's embarrassing to make that mistake.​ ​​

309
00:13:00,797 --> 00:13:03,500
​​​ ​A whole year is a bit shocking.​ ​​

310
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,003
​​​ ​Our next segment is...​ ​​

311
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:11,608
​​​ ​KFP's Road to Greatness!​ ​​

312
00:13:12,909 --> 00:13:18,181
​​​ ​This is Kiara-senpai's segment!​ ​​
​​ ​Please explain it.​ ​​

313
00:13:18,181 --> 00:13:19,816
​​​ ​Okaaay!​ ​​

314
00:13:19,816 --> 00:13:24,687
​​​ ​I'm actually the CEO of KFP,​ ​​

315
00:13:24,687 --> 00:13:29,092
​​​ ​and I'm currently looking for​ ​​
​​ ​a manager for the Japan branch!​ ​​

316
00:13:31,027 --> 00:13:35,632
​​​ ​I'll have you two participate in a test​ ​​
​​ ​to see whether you're fit for the job.​ ​​

317
00:13:35,632 --> 00:13:37,467
​​​ ​Are you ready? It's a test.​ ​​

318
00:13:37,467 --> 00:13:39,903
​​​ ​Reine-senpai will have to​ ​​
​​ ​come to Japan if she gets accepted.​ ​​

319
00:13:41,037 --> 00:13:42,939
​​​ ​Do well,​ ​​

320
00:13:42,939 --> 00:13:46,309
​​​ ​and it certainly won't hurt your chances!​ ​​

321
00:13:46,309 --> 00:13:48,044
​​​ ​Won't hurt our chances.​ ​​

322
00:13:48,044 --> 00:13:51,648
​​​ ​Let's get on with the test!​ ​​

323
00:13:51,648 --> 00:13:54,350
​​​ ​First up is this!​ ​​

324
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:56,286
​​​ ​Manager Qualification #1:​ ​​

325
00:13:56,286 --> 00:13:58,888
​​​ ​Proper assignment of staff!​ ​​

326
00:13:58,888 --> 00:14:02,692
​​​ ​A manager needs to have​ ​​
​​ ​the skill to figure out​ ​​

327
00:14:02,692 --> 00:14:05,795
​​​ ​what task each staff member​ ​​
​​ ​is best suited to.​ ​​

328
00:14:05,795 --> 00:14:08,431
​​​ ​In a Japanese 4-character compound,​ ​​

329
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:09,799
​​​ ​that'd be "Right man for the job."​ ​​

330
00:14:11,835 --> 00:14:16,339
​​​ ​You will be shown pictures​ ​​
​​ ​of four holo members.​ ​​

331
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:19,709
​​​ ​You'll assign them to​ ​​
​​ ​work the register, cook in the kitchen,​ ​​

332
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:24,514
​​​ ​hand out flyers, or deliver orders.​ ​​

333
00:14:24,514 --> 00:14:27,350
​​​ ​As you decide, please think about​ ​​

334
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:30,820
​​​ ​who seems best for which job.​ ​​

335
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,654
​​​ ​Okay!​ ​​

336
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,889
​​​ ​If your assignments​ ​​

337
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:35,825
​​​ ​are the same as mine,​ ​​

338
00:14:35,825 --> 00:14:39,495
​​​ ​then you're fit for the manager role!​ ​​

339
00:14:41,197 --> 00:14:45,935
​​​ ​The holo members applying​ ​​
​​ ​for part-time jobs this time are...​ ​​

340
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,109
​​​ ​They're certainly... unique.​ ​​

341
00:14:52,609 --> 00:14:54,277
​​​ ​True.​ ​​

342
00:14:53,109 --> 00:14:56,412
​​​ ​Quite a unique collection of individuals.​ ​​

343
00:14:56,412 --> 00:15:00,316
​​​ ​Who handles the kitchen is fairly important,​ ​​

344
00:14:59,849 --> 00:15:01,217
​​​ ​That's true.​ ​​

345
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:03,086
​​​ ​so please put extra consideration on that.​ ​​

346
00:15:03,086 --> 00:15:05,154
​​​ ​Time to show their answers!​ ​​

347
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,789
​​​ ​Let's do it all together now!​ ​​

348
00:15:06,789 --> 00:15:09,893
​​​ ​Here are their answers!​ ​​

349
00:15:11,928 --> 00:15:14,631
​​​ ​Let's take a look at Reine-chan's first.​ ​​

350
00:15:14,631 --> 00:15:17,467
​​​ ​Luna-senpai at the counter. Okay.​ ​​

351
00:15:17,467 --> 00:15:19,636
​​​ ​Haato-senpai at the kitche― Ugh.​ ​​

352
00:15:19,636 --> 00:15:20,303
​​​ ​Really...​ ​​

353
00:15:20,303 --> 00:15:22,071
​​​ ​Suisei-senpai handing out flyers.​ ​​

354
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:23,539
​​​ ​And Chloe doing delivery.​ ​​

355
00:15:23,539 --> 00:15:25,275
​​​ ​Why this arrangement?​ ​​

356
00:15:25,275 --> 00:15:26,676
​​​ ​As you can see,​ ​​

357
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:30,179
​​​ ​this is my ideal setup for KFP Indonesia.​ ​​

358
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,414
​​​ ​For the cashier counters,​ ​​

359
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,414
​​​ ​Oh... Okay...?​ ​​

360
00:15:31,414 --> 00:15:32,782
​​​ ​I chose Luna-senpai​ ​​

361
00:15:32,782 --> 00:15:35,919
​​​ ​for her appealing way of talking.​ ​​

362
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:40,023
​​​ ​I can also see her being really​ ​​
​​ ​enthusiastic behind the counter.​ ​​

363
00:15:36,886 --> 00:15:37,987
​​​ ​uwu​ ​​

364
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:41,591
​​​ ​Are you sure about having​ ​​
​<i>​ ​her </i>in your kitchen?​ ​​

365
00:15:41,591 --> 00:15:42,825
​​​ ​It'll be fine!​ ​​

366
00:15:42,825 --> 00:15:44,494
​​​ ​I remember Haato-senpai​ ​​

367
00:15:44,494 --> 00:15:46,529
​​​ ​does a lot of cooking streams...​ ​​

368
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:48,231
​​​ ​She does cook quite a lot.​ ​​

369
00:15:48,231 --> 00:15:52,235
​​​ ​🔥HAACHAMA COOKING🔥​ ​​

370
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:51,334
​​​ ​That's a nice way of putting it.​ ​​

371
00:15:52,235 --> 00:15:53,603
​​​ ​For the flyers,​ ​​

372
00:15:53,603 --> 00:15:55,171
​​​ ​I chose Suisei-senpai.​ ​​

373
00:15:55,171 --> 00:15:58,975
​​​ ​She has that charisma​ ​​
​​ ​we could put to good use.​ ​​

374
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,910
​​​ ​How about having her sing​ ​​
​​ ​while handing out flyers?​ ​​

375
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,278
​​​ ​That's a pretty good idea.​ ​​

376
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:03,046
​​​ ​Yeah! Just like that!​ ​​

377
00:16:02,278 --> 00:16:04,013
​​​ ​I'm sure people would love it.​ ​​

378
00:16:04,013 --> 00:16:05,348
​​​ ​Yeah!​ ​​

379
00:16:05,348 --> 00:16:07,583
​​​ ​I put Chloe on delivery.​ ​​

380
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,452
​​​ ​My reason being that as an orca,​ ​​

381
00:16:09,452 --> 00:16:11,187
​​​ ​she'll be able to deliver​ ​​

382
00:16:11,187 --> 00:16:14,657
​​​ ​your food anywhere: land or sea.​ ​​

383
00:16:12,789 --> 00:16:14,657
​​​ ​Ooh, that makes sense.​ ​​

384
00:16:14,657 --> 00:16:16,492
​​​ ​That's your logic, huh.​ ​​

385
00:16:15,425 --> 00:16:16,492
​​​ ​Pretty good.​ ​​

386
00:16:15,792 --> 00:16:17,393
​​​ ​I think she fits that role.​ ​​

387
00:16:16,492 --> 00:16:17,927
​​​ ​Nice!​ ​​

388
00:16:17,927 --> 00:16:19,329
​​​ ​That's my ideal KFP Indonesia.​ ​​

389
00:16:17,927 --> 00:16:21,631
​​​ ​Tell me the reasoning for your picks, Lui-san.​ ​​

390
00:16:21,631 --> 00:16:24,767
​​​ ​Okay! So I put Haato-senpai​ ​​
​​ ​on the cashier counter​ ​​

391
00:16:24,767 --> 00:16:28,071
​​​ ​because she knows​ ​​
​​ ​how to speak in English,​ ​​

392
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:30,406
​​​ ​which lets her handle​ ​​
​​ ​foreign customers well.​ ​​

393
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:33,509
​​​ ​The other reason is that I absolutely​ ​​
​​ ​don't want her in the kitchen.​ ​​

394
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:34,544
​​​ ​That's true.​ ​​

395
00:16:35,712 --> 00:16:36,612
​​​ ​Right?!​ ​​

396
00:16:36,612 --> 00:16:39,782
​​​ ​I'll let Luna-senpai handle​ ​​
​​ ​the kitchen since she can cook.​ ​​

397
00:16:39,782 --> 00:16:44,587
​​​ ​Chloe has periods​ ​​
​​ ​where she doesn't bathe,​ ​​

398
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:47,190
​​​ ​so I want to keep her away from food​ ​​

399
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:49,158
​​​ ​as much as humanly possible.​ ​​

400
00:16:49,158 --> 00:16:51,127
​​​ ​She might pose herself as​ ​​

401
00:16:51,127 --> 00:16:54,330
​​​ ​a significant health risk for the food,​ ​​

402
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:56,366
​​​ ​That's gotten me worried.​ ​​

403
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:59,302
​​​ ​hence why I sent her out​ ​​
​​ ​to hand out flyers instead.​ ​​

404
00:16:59,302 --> 00:17:03,172
​​​ ​Suisei-senpai does things very thoroughly,​ ​​

405
00:17:03,172 --> 00:17:05,508
​​​ ​so putting her in charge of deliveries​ ​​

406
00:17:05,508 --> 00:17:09,245
​​​ ​would make the entire​ ​​
​​ ​delivery process more efficient.​ ​​

407
00:17:09,245 --> 00:17:11,180
​​​ ​I can see that, yes.​ ​​

408
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,815
​​​ ​Mmm, okay then!​ ​​

409
00:17:12,815 --> 00:17:16,386
​​​ ​Time for me to reveal my answer!​ ​​

410
00:17:15,318 --> 00:17:16,386
​​​ ​Alright!​ ​​

411
00:17:17,587 --> 00:17:19,055
​​​ ​Here it is!​ ​​

412
00:17:18,421 --> 00:17:19,989
​​​ ​It's totally different!​ ​​

413
00:17:19,822 --> 00:17:20,757
​​​ ​None of them match!​ ​​

414
00:17:19,989 --> 00:17:23,292
​​​ ​Mmm, well... There are some matches.​ ​​

415
00:17:21,657 --> 00:17:22,625
​​​ ​Oh, huh!​ ​​

416
00:17:23,526 --> 00:17:24,394
​​​ ​Aaah...​ ​​

417
00:17:24,394 --> 00:17:24,894
​​​ ​Yeah.​ ​​

418
00:17:24,894 --> 00:17:28,197
​​​ ​So first off, I'd put Suisei-senpai​ ​​
​​ ​in charge of the counter.​ ​​

419
00:17:28,197 --> 00:17:30,800
​​​ ​I'd assign her there since she has​ ​​

420
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,536
​​​ ​a really charming face and personality.​ ​​

421
00:17:33,536 --> 00:17:35,838
​​​ ​That should make her easy to talk to.​ ​​

422
00:17:35,838 --> 00:17:39,575
​​​ ​I put Luna-senpai in the kitchen since​ ​​

423
00:17:39,575 --> 00:17:42,145
​​​ ​I heard that she knows how to cook.​ ​​

424
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:43,746
​​​ ​For the flyer distribution,​ ​​

425
00:17:43,746 --> 00:17:48,618
​​​ ​I was considering Haachama​ ​​
​​ ​for her upbeat personality.​ ​​

426
00:17:48,618 --> 00:17:52,121
​​​ ​She's also cute so I'm sure​ ​​
​​ ​that would help in her work.​ ​​

427
00:17:52,121 --> 00:17:54,690
​​​ ​I will never let her set foot in the kitchen.​ ​​

428
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,359
​​​ ​Absolutely no chance.​ ​​

429
00:17:55,925 --> 00:17:56,492
​​​ ​Why?!​ ​​

430
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:58,394
​​​ ​Same thoughts. Same braincell.​ ​​

431
00:17:58,394 --> 00:18:00,463
​​​ ​Just as you said, Reine-chan,​ ​​

432
00:18:00,463 --> 00:18:02,832
​​​ ​Chloe-chan can travel through water,​ ​​

433
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:05,468
​​​ ​so I put her in charge of deliveries.​ ​​

434
00:18:05,468 --> 00:18:08,337
​​​ ​With all that said,​ ​​
​​ ​I can say that both of you​ ​​

435
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:11,741
​​​ ​got some parts of it correctly,​ ​​

436
00:18:11,741 --> 00:18:12,975
​​​ ​so you both passed.​ ​​

437
00:18:12,975 --> 00:18:15,945
​​​ ​Do not put Haachama in the kitchen though.​ ​​

438
00:18:12,975 --> 00:18:13,876
​​​ ​Really?​ ​​

439
00:18:18,281 --> 00:18:21,017
​​​ ​The next skill we test for is this one!​ ​​

440
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:24,720
​​​ ​Manager Check #2: Memory Recall!​ ​​

441
00:18:23,786 --> 00:18:25,354
​​​ ​Memory Recall!​ ​​

442
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,690
​​​ ​We're all holobirds in this group,​ ​​

443
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,326
​​​ ​so we're all probably birdbrained as well.​ ​​

444
00:18:30,326 --> 00:18:33,229
​​​ ​I'm expecting you guys to have​ ​​
​​ ​good memory recall, but...​ ​​

445
00:18:33,229 --> 00:18:34,430
​​​ ​You sure?​ ​​

446
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:38,067
​​​ ​I'm an exceptionally special bird,​ ​​
​​ ​so I should be fine.​ ​​

447
00:18:38,067 --> 00:18:41,904
​​​ ​For this part, we'll have you two​ ​​
​​ ​look at a picture of a burger.​ ​​

448
00:18:41,904 --> 00:18:43,840
​​​ ​The burger has its parts​ ​​

449
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,743
​​​ ​arranged in a very specific order,​ ​​
​​ ​and you have only a few seconds​ ​​

450
00:18:47,743 --> 00:18:49,245
​​​ ​to memorize the order of assembly.​ ​​

451
00:18:49,245 --> 00:18:50,680
​​​ ​Got it!​ ​​

452
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:54,350
​​​ ​Let's get to our first burger! Bam!​ ​​

453
00:18:53,649 --> 00:18:54,717
​​​ ​Okay!​ ​​

454
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:06,929
​​​ ​Whoa, that was fast!​ ​​

455
00:19:06,929 --> 00:19:08,030
​​​ ​Literally 10 seconds!​ ​​

456
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,999
​​​ ​Let's have Reine-chan go first!​ ​​

457
00:19:09,999 --> 00:19:11,400
​​​ ​From the bottom:​ ​​

458
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,436
​​​ ​bun, patty, patty,​ ​​

459
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,873
​​​ ​bun, patty, patty, sauce, tomato,​ ​​

460
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,275
​​​ ​lettuce, and then bun.​ ​​

461
00:19:21,277 --> 00:19:22,645
​​​ ​Eh, uh... Ah...​ ​​

462
00:19:22,645 --> 00:19:23,679
​​​ ​Same with her.​ ​​

463
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:24,847
​​​ ​My answer's the same.​ ​​

464
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:24,847
​​​ ​Same for you?​ ​​

465
00:19:24,847 --> 00:19:25,982
​​​ ​Yep, the same.​ ​​

466
00:19:24,847 --> 00:19:28,284
​​​ ​Oh. Hmm, okay. I see.​ ​​

467
00:19:25,982 --> 00:19:28,284
​​​ ​Bun, meat, meat,​ ​​

468
00:19:28,284 --> 00:19:31,988
​​​ ​ketchup, tomato, lettuce, and bun.​ ​​

469
00:19:31,988 --> 00:19:34,157
​​​ ​This ordering is from the bottom.​ ​​

470
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:34,557
​​​ ​Yep, from the bottom.​ ​​

471
00:19:34,157 --> 00:19:35,124
​​​ ​From right.​ ​​

472
00:19:35,124 --> 00:19:37,393
​​​ ​Well umm...​ ​​
​​ ​I guess you two got it right...​ ​​

473
00:19:38,561 --> 00:19:40,963
​​​ ​Let's look at it again!​ ​​

474
00:19:38,561 --> 00:19:40,963
​​​ ​Boss...?​ ​​

475
00:19:40,963 --> 00:19:44,066
​​​ ​Bun, meat, meat, ketchup, tomato, lettuce!​ ​​

476
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:45,034
​​​ ​And bun!​ ​​

477
00:19:45,034 --> 00:19:45,801
​​​ ​Yep.​ ​​

478
00:19:45,801 --> 00:19:47,837
​​​ ​That's the answer!​ ​​

479
00:19:47,036 --> 00:19:48,938
​​​ ​Yaaaay!​ ​​

480
00:19:47,837 --> 00:19:49,272
​​​ ​Perfect!​ ​​

481
00:19:49,705 --> 00:19:50,106
​​​ ​Perfect.​ ​​

482
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:51,174
​​​ ​Great!​ ​​

483
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:51,607
​​​ ​Let's go!​ ​​

484
00:19:51,174 --> 00:19:53,576
​​​ ​I feel relieved that...​ ​​

485
00:19:53,576 --> 00:19:57,480
​​​ ​I didn't need to give my own answer...​ ​​

486
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:01,517
​​​ ​Let's move on to our next segment!​ ​​

487
00:20:02,818 --> 00:20:06,989
​​​ ​Romantic Laboratory!​ ​​

488
00:20:09,425 --> 00:20:10,927
​​​ ​Ooh la la!​ ​​

489
00:20:10,927 --> 00:20:15,298
​​​ ​This segment will be handled by Reine-senpai!​ ​​

490
00:20:11,027 --> 00:20:12,862
​​​ ​Mamma mia!​ ​​

491
00:20:14,997 --> 00:20:16,165
​​​ ​Yes!​ ​​

492
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:17,600
​​​ ​It's her Romantic Laboratory!​ ​​

493
00:20:15,565 --> 00:20:17,166
​​​ ​Oh dear me!​ ​​

494
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,834
​​​ ​Yes yes!​ ​​

495
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,937
​​​ ​Truth be told, I tend to​ ​​

496
00:20:20,937 --> 00:20:24,640
​​​ ​make a pastime out of daydreaming.​ ​​

497
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,510
​​​ ​I particularly love dreaming up​ ​​
​​ ​romantic scenarios!​ ​​

498
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,878
​​​ ​Gehehehe...​ ​​

499
00:20:28,878 --> 00:20:30,680
​​​ ​In this segment,​ ​​

500
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,183
​​​ ​we will be given situations―​ ​​

501
00:20:34,183 --> 00:20:36,752
​​​ ​Dangerous ones, to be specific.​ ​​

502
00:20:36,752 --> 00:20:39,121
​​​ ​We'll be taking those dangerous situations,​ ​​

503
00:20:39,121 --> 00:20:42,892
​​​ ​and think of ways to turn them​ ​​
​​ ​into enjoyable romances.​ ​​

504
00:20:42,892 --> 00:20:46,195
​​​ ​We should be able to reimagine​ ​​
​​ ​them as romantic scenarios​ ​​

505
00:20:46,195 --> 00:20:48,564
​​​ ​all of us could enjoy.​ ​​

506
00:20:48,564 --> 00:20:48,998
​​​ ​Yeah.​ ​​

507
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:51,434
​​​ ​I see how it works!​ ​​

508
00:20:51,434 --> 00:20:54,103
​​​ ​Let's start off with Situation #1!​ ​​

509
00:20:56,305 --> 00:21:02,011
​​​ ​You're a spy and the target is the enemy boss.​ ​​

510
00:21:03,212 --> 00:21:04,046
​​​ ​One day,​ ​​

511
00:21:04,046 --> 00:21:08,451
​​​ ​the boss manages to​ ​​
​​ ​find out your identity as a spy.​ ​​

512
00:21:08,451 --> 00:21:09,885
​​​ ​O M G!​ ​​

513
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:13,923
​​​ ​Transform this life-or-death situation​ ​​

514
00:21:13,923 --> 00:21:17,260
​​​ ​into a love story with a happy end!​ ​​

515
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:17,627
​​​ ​Alright!​ ​​

516
00:21:17,627 --> 00:21:21,030
​​​ ​Eeek! They've found me out!​ ​​

517
00:21:18,628 --> 00:21:21,030
​​​ ​Okay!​ ​​

518
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,898
​​​ ​I've already thought of one!​ ​​

519
00:21:22,898 --> 00:21:24,300
​​​ ​I've also thought of one.​ ​​

520
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,334
​​​ ​Damn, you guys are fast!​ ​​

521
00:21:25,334 --> 00:21:26,202
​​​ ​Okay then.​ ​​

522
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:28,304
​​​ ​Let's start with Lui-san.​ ​​

523
00:21:28,304 --> 00:21:29,605
​​​ ​The floor is yours!​ ​​

524
00:21:29,605 --> 00:21:30,573
​​​ ​Okay.​ ​​

525
00:21:30,573 --> 00:21:34,243
​​​ ​I ended up falling in love​ ​​
​​ ​with the enemy boss​ ​​

526
00:21:34,243 --> 00:21:37,446
​​​ ​while hiding my spy identity from him.​ ​​

527
00:21:38,014 --> 00:21:41,083
​​​ ​When I confess this to him, he says,​ ​​

528
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:44,720
​​​ ​"I would have had you executed by now,​ ​​

529
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,724
​​​ ​but I actually love you, even if you're a spy!"​ ​​

530
00:21:50,593 --> 00:21:54,964
​​​ ​His clients are starting to suspect​ ​​
​​ ​a spy in the group,​ ​​

531
00:21:54,964 --> 00:21:59,335
​​​ ​so in order to escape their hired guns,​ ​​

532
00:21:59,335 --> 00:22:00,770
​​​ ​the two decide to flee.​ ​​

533
00:22:02,638 --> 00:22:05,174
​​​ ​Hold on! Mine's almost the same!​ ​​

534
00:22:04,507 --> 00:22:07,209
​​​ ​That's all! How was it?​ ​​

535
00:22:04,507 --> 00:22:05,508
​​​ ​Really now?!​ ​​

536
00:22:07,209 --> 00:22:08,277
​​​ ​Exquisite!​ ​​

537
00:22:08,277 --> 00:22:09,412
​​​ ​Splendid work!​ ​​

538
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:10,179
​​​ ​Nice!​ ​​

539
00:22:10,179 --> 00:22:11,847
​​​ ​Let's hear Kiara's version―​ ​​

540
00:22:11,847 --> 00:22:13,015
​​​ ​Yours is similar?​ ​​

541
00:22:13,549 --> 00:22:15,051
​​​ ​Yeah, mine's very similar.​ ​​

542
00:22:15,051 --> 00:22:16,052
​​​ ​It's a bit similar?​ ​​

543
00:22:16,052 --> 00:22:18,654
​​​ ​Well, in any case, let's hear it!​ ​​

544
00:22:16,052 --> 00:22:17,586
​​​ ​Can I start?​ ​​

545
00:22:18,654 --> 00:22:19,155
​​​ ​Start!​ ​​

546
00:22:19,155 --> 00:22:20,022
​​​ ​Okay!​ ​​

547
00:22:20,022 --> 00:22:22,625
​​​ ​So as we know, this is her...​ ​​

548
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:25,795
​​​ ​This is a spy's love story, and she's clearly​ ​​

549
00:22:25,795 --> 00:22:28,431
​​​ ​in love with the enemy boss.​ ​​

550
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:31,167
​​​ ​Meanwhile, the boss actually seems​ ​​

551
00:22:31,167 --> 00:22:34,937
​​​ ​to hate his current job,​ ​​
​​ ​going as far as to say stuff like,​ ​​

552
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:37,907
​​​ ​"I wanna quit. I wanna do something else."​ ​​

553
00:22:37,139 --> 00:22:38,507
​​​ ​Ooh, I see!​ ​​

554
00:22:37,907 --> 00:22:39,709
​​​ ​That's all he thinks about.​ ​​

555
00:22:39,709 --> 00:22:42,745
​​​ ​The love affair was convenient timing for him,​ ​​

556
00:22:42,745 --> 00:22:46,916
​​​ ​as it gave them an excuse​ ​​
​​ ​to escape to a deserted island.​ ​​

557
00:22:45,314 --> 00:22:46,916
​​​ ​They flee here too!​ ​​

558
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:48,884
​​​ ​Yep! Exactly!​ ​​

559
00:22:48,884 --> 00:22:50,986
​​​ ​Where no one can find them...​ ​​

560
00:22:48,884 --> 00:22:50,986
​​​ ​That's my story!​ ​​

561
00:22:50,986 --> 00:22:52,254
​​​ ​Yay!​ ​​

562
00:22:50,986 --> 00:22:53,456
​​​ ​That's pretty good!​ ​​

563
00:22:52,154 --> 00:22:54,657
​​​ ​An amazing story!​ ​​

564
00:22:52,254 --> 00:22:55,825
​​​ ​A beautiful deserted island!​ ​​

565
00:22:54,223 --> 00:22:55,825
​​​ ​Splendid!​ ​​

566
00:22:54,657 --> 00:22:57,093
​​​ ​It's very romantic! Good work!​ ​​

567
00:22:55,825 --> 00:22:58,060
​​​ ​Romantic!​ ​​

568
00:22:57,093 --> 00:22:59,528
​​​ ​Both of your imaginations are very...​ ​​

569
00:22:59,528 --> 00:23:00,529
​​​ ​Nice, I would say!​ ​​

570
00:23:00,529 --> 00:23:02,765
​​​ ​Very very nice!​ ​​

571
00:23:00,529 --> 00:23:02,765
​​​ ​Pretty much.​ ​​

572
00:23:02,765 --> 00:23:03,899
​​​ ​Thank you!​ ​​

573
00:23:02,765 --> 00:23:07,002
​​​ ​But if you were to do it,​ ​​
​​ ​how would it go, Miss Reine?​ ​​

574
00:23:07,002 --> 00:23:07,703
​​​ ​Okay, so!​ ​​

575
00:23:07,703 --> 00:23:09,538
​​​ ​This is one of my favorite scenarios.​ ​​

576
00:23:09,538 --> 00:23:10,406
​​​ ​When the spy goes,​ ​​

577
00:23:10,406 --> 00:23:12,575
​​​ ​"Oh nyo! I've been found out!"​ ​​

578
00:23:12,575 --> 00:23:14,977
​​​ ​I'm quite sure that she's afraid​ ​​

579
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:17,213
​​​ ​she's gonna fail her mission.​ ​​

580
00:23:17,213 --> 00:23:18,347
​​​ ​Easy to see why.​ ​​

581
00:23:17,213 --> 00:23:18,848
​​​ ​But then, the enemy boss says,​ ​​

582
00:23:18,848 --> 00:23:23,652
​​​ ​"Don't worry, I, too,​ ​​
​​ ​am actually a spy!"​ ​​

583
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,621
​​​ ​I don't know who he is​ ​​
​​ ​spying for though, but anyway!​ ​​

584
00:23:25,621 --> 00:23:27,356
​​​ ​Ehh!​ ​​

585
00:23:27,356 --> 00:23:29,625
​​​ ​He then says,​ ​​
​​ ​"You and I are the same...​ ​​

586
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:30,993
​​​ ​Let's get married!"​ ​​

587
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:31,594
​​​ ​And so,​ ​​

588
00:23:31,594 --> 00:23:32,962
​​​ ​that straightforward style​ ​​

589
00:23:32,962 --> 00:23:34,163
​​​ ​makes her fall for him.​ ​​

590
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:37,566
​​​ ​The two then get married.​ ​​
​​ ​And they lived happily ever after.​ ​​

591
00:23:37,566 --> 00:23:38,868
​​​ ​The End!​ ​​

592
00:23:37,566 --> 00:23:41,237
​​​ ​That's really good!​ ​​

593
00:23:41,237 --> 00:23:44,206
​​​ ​Hearing how other people imagine it​ ​​

594
00:23:44,206 --> 00:23:46,041
​​​ ​gets me very excited!​ ​​

595
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:47,510
​​​ ​This is really great!​ ​​

596
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,544
​​​ ​Just being able to...​ ​​

597
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:50,112
​​​ ​You're clearly getting​ ​​

598
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:50,112
​​​ ​I kinda get you.​ ​​

599
00:23:50,112 --> 00:23:52,481
​​​ ​real hype for this, Reine-senpai.​ ​​

600
00:23:51,414 --> 00:23:53,983
​​​ ​The hype is real, Reine-chan!​ ​​

601
00:23:53,983 --> 00:23:55,785
​​​ ​Now for the next... the second one!​ ​​

602
00:23:53,983 --> 00:23:55,151
​​​ ​The second one?​ ​​

603
00:23:55,785 --> 00:23:57,553
​​​ ​Let's start the next one!​ ​​

604
00:23:58,053 --> 00:24:00,389
​​​ ​Oh my god, that's a lot of kanji.​ ​​

605
00:24:00,389 --> 00:24:01,490
​​​ ​So umm...​ ​​

606
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:03,726
​​​ ​You're an office lady working for a bank.​ ​​

607
00:24:05,094 --> 00:24:06,128
​​​ ​One day,​ ​​

608
00:24:06,128 --> 00:24:10,766
​​​ ​the bank you're working for​ ​​
​​ ​was raided by armed robbers!​ ​​

609
00:24:10,766 --> 00:24:12,134
​​​ ​O M G!​ ​​

610
00:24:11,066 --> 00:24:12,134
​​​ ​Yikes!​ ​​

611
00:24:12,134 --> 00:24:15,905
​​​ ​The robbers take you hostage,​ ​​

612
00:24:15,905 --> 00:24:18,507
​​​ ​holing themselves up in the bank.​ ​​

613
00:24:18,507 --> 00:24:19,909
​​​ ​I got a story now.​ ​​

614
00:24:19,909 --> 00:24:21,477
​​​ ​Same here.​ ​​

615
00:24:21,477 --> 00:24:22,945
​​​ ​You guys are quick!​ ​​

616
00:24:21,477 --> 00:24:22,945
​​​ ​We're fast!​ ​​

617
00:24:22,945 --> 00:24:23,946
​​​ ​You know, I was―​ ​​

618
00:24:23,946 --> 00:24:25,481
​​​ ​I wanted to have at least​ ​​

619
00:24:25,481 --> 00:24:26,449
​​​ ​one thinking session,​ ​​

620
00:24:26,449 --> 00:24:28,150
​​​ ​but you're both so fast!​ ​​

621
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:29,785
​​​ ​I expect no less from the holobirds.​ ​​

622
00:24:30,786 --> 00:24:32,221
​​​ ​Do we start?​ ​​

623
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:33,656
​​​ ​Can I hear your stories now?​ ​​

624
00:24:33,656 --> 00:24:35,758
​​​ ​Let's start this round with...​ ​​

625
00:24:35,758 --> 00:24:37,193
​​​ ​Kiara, if you please.​ ​​

626
00:24:37,193 --> 00:24:38,427
​​​ ​So you're at the bank.​ ​​

627
00:24:38,427 --> 00:24:41,630
​​​ ​It's just the two of you left at that bank.​ ​​

628
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:42,531
​​​ ​Just two...?​ ​​

629
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:44,433
​​​ ​All of a sudden...​ ​​

630
00:24:43,165 --> 00:24:44,433
​​​ ​Just the two of them.​ ​​

631
00:24:44,967 --> 00:24:47,136
​​​ ​Y'all wanna know right?​ ​​

632
00:24:47,136 --> 00:24:48,304
​​​ ​So like,​ ​​

633
00:24:48,304 --> 00:24:50,039
​​​ ​this office lady is​ ​​

634
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:52,675
​​​ ​scared and shaking in her boots.​ ​​

635
00:24:52,675 --> 00:24:57,012
​​​ ​Then, all of a sudden,​ ​​
​​ ​another person comes into the bank!​ ​​

636
00:24:57,012 --> 00:25:00,783
​​​ ​To everyone's surprise,​ ​​
​​ ​it was another robber!​ ​​

637
00:25:00,783 --> 00:25:02,685
​​​ ​Whaaat?!​ ​​

638
00:25:01,183 --> 00:25:01,984
​​​ ​Wow!​ ​​

639
00:25:01,984 --> 00:25:02,685
​​​ ​What?!​ ​​

640
00:25:02,685 --> 00:25:06,055
​​​ ​Seeing both the office lady​ ​​
​​ ​and the previous robber,​ ​​

641
00:25:06,055 --> 00:25:09,291
​​​ ​the new guy fires a shot at them.​ ​​

642
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:13,429
​​​ ​The office lady stands​ ​​
​​ ​in front of the robber,​ ​​

643
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:16,031
​​​ ​giving him some cover.​ ​​

644
00:25:16,031 --> 00:25:17,633
​​​ ​Whaaat?!​ ​​

645
00:25:16,465 --> 00:25:19,802
​​​ ​She then gets hit by the bullet and dies!​ ​​

646
00:25:19,802 --> 00:25:22,204
​​​ ​What?! Where's the happy end?!​ ​​

647
00:25:22,204 --> 00:25:25,574
​​​ ​The first robber thinks​ ​​
​​ ​to himself, "You saved me..."​ ​​

648
00:25:24,907 --> 00:25:26,942
​​​ ​That's so tragic...​ ​​

649
00:25:25,741 --> 00:25:29,311
​​​ ​He gets into a romantic melancholy,​ ​​

650
00:25:28,043 --> 00:25:29,311
​​​ ​So sad...​ ​​

651
00:25:29,311 --> 00:25:33,215
​​​ ​and starts a fight with the other robber.​ ​​

652
00:25:33,215 --> 00:25:37,686
​​​ ​But he ends up dying,​ ​​
​​ ​so he and the office lady are both dead.​ ​​

653
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:40,589
​​​ ​Where's the happy end...?​ ​​

654
00:25:39,655 --> 00:25:42,658
​​​ ​They're both happy in heaven.​ ​​

655
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,225
​​​ ​Happy in heaven, huh.​ ​​

656
00:25:43,225 --> 00:25:45,027
​​​ ​Yes, yes, yes.​ ​​

657
00:25:45,027 --> 00:25:47,062
​​​ ​It's a bittersweet ending.​ ​​

658
00:25:47,062 --> 00:25:49,498
​​​ ​Let's hear from Lui-san next!​ ​​

659
00:25:49,498 --> 00:25:50,232
​​​ ​Alright.​ ​​

660
00:25:50,232 --> 00:25:53,936
​​​ ​One day, a robber raided my workplace.​ ​​

661
00:25:53,936 --> 00:25:57,039
​​​ ​Everyone was held hostage.​ ​​

662
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:00,276
​​​ ​But then, a guy behind me whispers,​ ​​

663
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:57,973
​​​ ​Oh no!​ ​​

664
00:26:00,276 --> 00:26:03,779
​​​ ​"Lui-san, run to that door. Please trust me."​ ​​

665
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:05,414
​​​ ​That's what he said to me.​ ​​

666
00:26:05,414 --> 00:26:09,318
​​​ ​The guy who whispered​ ​​
​​ ​was my unassuming deskmate,​ ​​

667
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:10,452
​​​ ​Takahashi-kun.​ ​​

668
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,721
​​​ ​Takahashi-kun?!​ ​​

669
00:26:12,721 --> 00:26:16,392
​​​ ​It was the unassuming and​ ​​
​​ ​slightly incompetent Takahashi-kun!​ ​​

670
00:26:16,392 --> 00:26:17,860
​​​ ​He often made mistakes at work,​ ​​

671
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:21,130
​​​ ​but I decided to believe him​ ​​
​​ ​at that moment.​ ​​

672
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:26,769
​​​ ​Seeing us rush to the door,​ ​​
​​ ​the robber points at us, threatening to shoot.​ ​​

673
00:26:26,769 --> 00:26:31,006
​​​ ​Takahashi-kun retaliates by charging​ ​​
​​ ​and punching the robber.​ ​​

674
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:33,642
​​​ ​I manage to run away,​ ​​

675
00:26:33,642 --> 00:26:36,078
​​​ ​and the police come charging in.​ ​​

676
00:26:36,478 --> 00:26:39,181
​​​ ​The police then catch the robber.​ ​​

677
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:40,749
​​​ ​Takahashi-kun then told me,​ ​​

678
00:26:40,749 --> 00:26:43,352
​​​ ​"I wanted to protect you, Lui-san.​ ​​

679
00:26:40,749 --> 00:26:41,750
​​​ ​So cool...​ ​​

680
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:46,388
​​​ ​So I... went and made myself stronger."​ ​​

681
00:26:49,258 --> 00:26:50,993
​​​ ​How was it?​ ​​

682
00:26:49,258 --> 00:26:51,360
​​​ ​That was good!​ ​​

683
00:26:50,993 --> 00:26:53,896
​​​ ​That was amazing!​ ​​

684
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,896
​​​ ​It's an everyday hero story!​ ​​

685
00:26:53,896 --> 00:26:55,598
​​​ ​How would you do it, Reine-senpai?​ ​​

686
00:26:55,598 --> 00:26:58,233
​​​ ​It's a very spicy situation​ ​​
​​ ​that makes you say,​ ​​

687
00:26:58,233 --> 00:26:59,435
​​​ ​"Oh no!"​ ​​

688
00:26:59,435 --> 00:27:00,836
​​​ ​The office lady would go,​ ​​

689
00:27:00,836 --> 00:27:02,905
​​​ ​"Aah! Help me! Help me!"​ ​​

690
00:27:02,905 --> 00:27:03,739
​​​ ​And then,​ ​​

691
00:27:03,739 --> 00:27:06,408
​​​ ​she'd suddenly recognize the robber!​ ​​

692
00:27:06,408 --> 00:27:09,044
​​​ ​It turned out to be her childhood friend!​ ​​

693
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:09,979
​​​ ​What?!​ ​​

694
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:11,280
​​​ ​Seriously?!​ ​​

695
00:27:10,312 --> 00:27:11,280
​​​ ​Yes.​ ​​

696
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,282
​​​ ​"Why are you doing this?!"​ ​​

697
00:27:12,014 --> 00:27:13,282
​​​ ​Why?!​ ​​

698
00:27:13,282 --> 00:27:15,117
​​​ ​Turns out that the robber​ ​​

699
00:27:15,117 --> 00:27:17,353
​​​ ​was brainwashed by someone.​ ​​

700
00:27:17,353 --> 00:27:20,322
​​​ ​Like, what was it... Mind control?​ ​​

701
00:27:20,322 --> 00:27:24,193
​​​ ​When the robber saw the office lady's face,​ ​​

702
00:27:24,193 --> 00:27:25,461
​​​ ​the memory struck him!​ ​​

703
00:27:25,461 --> 00:27:27,129
​​​ ​And, at that moment,​ ​​

704
00:27:27,129 --> 00:27:28,297
​​​ ​he came to his senses.​ ​​

705
00:27:28,297 --> 00:27:30,366
​​​ ​"Oh, dear me! I'm so sorry!"​ ​​

706
00:27:30,366 --> 00:27:32,868
​​​ ​"I have <i>modotta </i>(returned) to my senses!"​ ​​

707
00:27:32,868 --> 00:27:33,869
​​​ ​"I have <i>modotta</i>!"​ ​​

708
00:27:32,868 --> 00:27:33,869
​​​ ​And then,​ ​​

709
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:36,372
​​​ ​and then, and then!​ ​​

710
00:27:36,372 --> 00:27:38,907
​​​ ​So there's that brainwashing guy, right?​ ​​

711
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:43,312
​​​ ​The two of them set out​ ​​
​​ ​in order to find that criminal.​ ​​

712
00:27:43,312 --> 00:27:44,480
​​​ ​As they went about it,​ ​​

713
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,215
​​​ ​the two grew closer,​ ​​

714
00:27:46,215 --> 00:27:47,783
​​​ ​until they eventually​ ​​

715
00:27:47,783 --> 00:27:50,853
​​​ ​started having feelings for each other.​ ​​

716
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:53,589
​​​ ​Then they found the culprit,​ ​​

717
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:54,690
​​​ ​and defeated him.​ ​​

718
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:57,893
​​​ ​At the end, he goes,​ ​​
​​ ​"Thanks for staying with me..."​ ​​

719
00:27:57,893 --> 00:28:01,130
​​​ ​"You know... I've always... loved..."​ ​​

720
00:27:59,294 --> 00:28:01,130
​​​ ​Too long!​ ​​

721
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:01,730
​​​ ​Sorry!​ ​​

722
00:28:01,163 --> 00:28:04,700
​​​ ​* This story has been​ ​​
​​ ​cut down considerably​ ​​

723
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:03,399
​​​ ​Just a bit more!​ ​​

724
00:28:03,399 --> 00:28:04,700
​​​ ​I'm about to finish!​ ​​

725
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:08,303
​​​ ​You're quite passionate​ ​​
​​ ​about this, Reine-chan.​ ​​

726
00:28:08,303 --> 00:28:10,272
​​​ ​We can clearly see it​ ​​
​​ ​when it comes to these topics.​ ​​

727
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:12,374
​​​ ​That passion burns hard.​ ​​

728
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:14,209
​​​ ​It's definitely a passion of mine.​ ​​

729
00:28:14,209 --> 00:28:15,811
​​​ ​Intense...​ ​​

730
00:28:16,011 --> 00:28:17,379
​​​ ​And we're done!​ ​​

731
00:28:17,379 --> 00:28:22,184
​​​ ​How did you all feel about today's show?​ ​​

732
00:28:22,184 --> 00:28:24,386
​​​ ​It was so fun!​ ​​

733
00:28:22,184 --> 00:28:24,853
​​​ ​We got three holobirds on set today.​ ​​

734
00:28:24,853 --> 00:28:28,490
​​​ ​There was a lot of passion​ ​​
​​ ​felt with today's topics.​ ​​

735
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:30,693
​​​ ​When you get all​ ​​
​​ ​the holobirds in one place,​ ​​

736
00:28:30,693 --> 00:28:34,496
​​​ ​it starts getting all noisy and chaotic.​ ​​

737
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,631
​​​ ​We do get pretty noisy.​ ​​

738
00:28:35,097 --> 00:28:37,066
​​​ ​Like loud chirping birds.​ ​​

739
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:37,066
​​​ ​Shrill, screaming birds.​ ​​

740
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:42,337
​​​ ​The MC for the next episode​ ​​
​​ ​will be Kiara-senpai!​ ​​

741
00:28:42,337 --> 00:28:44,373
​​​ ​Good luck, and do your best!​ ​​

742
00:28:44,373 --> 00:28:46,275
​​​ ​I'll try!​ ​​

743
00:28:46,275 --> 00:28:48,711
​​​ ​I'll be leaving this week, so yeah.​ ​​

744
00:28:48,711 --> 00:28:51,847
​​​ ​I'll leave the next episode to you, Kiara-senpai.​ ​​

745
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:50,813
​​​ ​Oh right...​ ​​

746
00:28:52,214 --> 00:28:54,616
​​​ ​It's been short, but goodbye!​ ​​

747
00:28:54,616 --> 00:28:57,453
​​​ ​Let's all have a trip again sometime.​ ​​

748
00:28:57,453 --> 00:28:58,053
​​​ ​A trip!​ ​​

749
00:28:57,453 --> 00:28:58,887
​​​ ​Cute!​ ​​

750
00:28:58,887 --> 00:28:59,922
​​​ ​Let's do it!​ ​​

751
00:28:59,922 --> 00:29:03,158
​​​ ​This show was brought to you by Takane Lui,​ ​​

752
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,861
​​​ ​Takanashi Kiara,​ ​​

753
00:29:05,861 --> 00:29:07,663
​​​ ​and Pavolia Reine!​ ​​

754
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:08,697
​​​ ​That is all!​ ​​

755
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:09,565
​​​ ​That's all folks!​ ​​

756
00:29:08,697 --> 00:29:10,265
​​​ ​Thanks for watching!​ ​​

757
00:29:09,565 --> 00:29:14,737
​​​ ​Until next time, see you!​ ​​

758
00:29:11,633 --> 00:29:17,473
​​​ ​Bye-bye!​ ​​
