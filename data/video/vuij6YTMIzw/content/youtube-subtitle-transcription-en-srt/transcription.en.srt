where these trees are and maybe there's
 

2575
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:46,350
where these trees are and maybe there's
an exit I'm assuming these are the

an exit I'm assuming these are the
 

2577
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:49,990
an exit I'm assuming these are the
trees how do we leave hold

2578
01:13:49,990 --> 01:13:50,000
trees how do we leave hold
 

2579
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:54,030
trees how do we leave hold
on I'll figure it

2580
01:13:54,030 --> 01:13:54,040

 

2581
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:59,470

the logic of a like this so I
 

5467
02:25:32,960 --> 02:25:35,790
the logic of a like this so I
mean I don't know there's a simpler way

5468
02:25:35,790 --> 02:25:35,800
mean I don't know there's a simpler way

click it though maybe it's a bad there's

5522
02:26:52,349 --> 02:26:52,359
click it though maybe it's a bad there's
 

5523
02:26:52,359 --> 02:26:53,790
click it though maybe it's a bad there's
no way that it's a limit because you've

5524
02:26:53,790 --> 02:26:53,800
no way that it's a limit because you've
 

5525
02:26:53,800 --> 02:26:57,030
no way that it's a limit because you've
been clicking it the most yeah yeah it's

5526
02:26:57,030 --> 02:26:57,040
been clicking it the most yeah yeah it's
 

5527
02:26:57,040 --> 02:26:59,750
been clicking it the most yeah yeah it's
probably bad but it's probably better

5528
02:26:59,750 --> 02:26:59,760
probably bad but it's probably better
 

5529
02:26:59,760 --> 02:27:01,429
probably bad but it's probably better
than all four of us doing it at the same

5530

than all four of us doing it at the same
 

5531
02:27:01,439 --> 02:27:03,790
than all four of us doing it at the same
time so yeah but the way to do it is

5532
02:27:03,790 --> 02:27:03,800
time so yeah but the way to do it is
 

5533
02:27:03,800 --> 02:27:06,389
time so yeah but the way to do it is
like you just keep track of like what

5534
02:27:06,389 --> 02:27:06,399
like you just keep track of like what
 

5535
02:27:06,399 --> 02:27:08,269
like you just keep track of like what
each like when you click one block what

5536
02:27:08,269 --> 02:27:08,279
each like when you click one block what
