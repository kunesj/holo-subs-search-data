13803
06:35:49,500 --> 06:35:52,730
yeah
problem is that at the time when we when

13804
06:35:52,730 --> 06:35:52,740
problem is that at the time when we when
 

13805
06:35:52,740 --> 06:35:55,368
problem is that at the time when we when
it like released and we had perms

13806
06:35:55,368 --> 06:35:55,378
it like released and we had perms
 

13807
06:35:55,378 --> 06:35:57,110
it like released and we had perms
I was

13808
06:35:57,110 --> 06:35:57,120
I was
 

13809
06:35:57,120 --> 06:35:58,970
I was
in Japan right

13810
06:35:58,970 --> 06:35:58,980
in Japan right
 

13811
06:35:58,980 --> 06:36:01,810
in Japan right
so I couldn't start right away

13812
06:36:01,810 --> 06:36:01,820
so I couldn't start right away
 

13813
06:36:01,820 --> 06:36:04,910
so I couldn't start right away
and I also didn't want to start in that

13814
06:36:04,910 --> 06:36:04,920
and I also didn't want to start in that
 

13815
06:36:04,920 --> 06:36:08,330
and I also didn't want to start in that
one week that I had in between

13816
06:36:08,330 --> 06:36:08,340
one week that I had in between
 

13817
06:36:08,340 --> 06:36:09,770
one week that I had in between
because I knew I wouldn't be able to

13818
06:36:09,770 --> 06:36:09,780
because I knew I wouldn't be able to
 

13819
06:36:09,780 --> 06:36:11,570
because I knew I wouldn't be able to
play properly

13820
06:36:11,570 --> 06:36:11,580
play properly
 

13821
06:36:11,580 --> 06:36:13,730
play properly
following that

13822
06:36:13,730 --> 06:36:13,740
following that
 

13823
06:36:13,740 --> 06:36:16,670
following that
so it's difficult

13824
06:36:16,670 --> 06:36:16,680
so it's difficult
 

13825
06:36:16,680 --> 06:36:18,948
so it's difficult
to start it now

13826
06:36:18,948 --> 06:36:18,958
to start it now
 

13827
06:36:18,958 --> 06:36:24,350
to start it now
because the release hype is dead

13828
06:36:24,350 --> 06:36:24,360
because the release hype is dead
 

13829
06:36:24,360 --> 06:36:26,690
because the release hype is dead
um but I also don't want to miss out on

06:36:26,690 --> 06:36:26,700
um but I also don't want to miss out on
 

13831
06:36:26,700 --> 06:36:29,390
um but I also don't want to miss out on
it because I've waited so long

13832
06:36:29,390 --> 06:36:29,400
it because I've waited so long
 

13833
06:36:29,400 --> 06:36:32,208
it because I've waited so long
that we would get permissions to play

13834
06:36:32,208 --> 06:36:32,218
that we would get permissions to play
 

13835
06:36:32,218 --> 06:36:34,548
that we would get permissions to play
any Final Fantasy game

13836
06:36:34,548 --> 06:36:34,558
any Final Fantasy game
 

13837

have to start start from scratch again
 

15377
07:14:42,478 --> 07:14:45,048

07:14:49,430 --> 07:14:49,440
this artist maybe this is this and then
 

15383
07:14:49,440 --> 07:14:51,770
this artist maybe this is this and then
they go out to check and it takes them

15384
07:14:51,770 --> 07:14:51,780
they go out to check and it takes them
 

15385
07:14:51,780 --> 07:14:53,990
they go out to check and it takes them
like maybe two or three weeks to get

15386
07:14:53,990 --> 07:14:54,000
like maybe two or three weeks to get
 

15387
07:14:54,000 --> 07:14:56,750
like maybe two or three weeks to get
back to me to get the okay

15388
07:14:56,750 --> 07:14:56,760
back to me to get the okay
 

15389
07:14:56,760 --> 07:14:59,150
back to me to get the okay
you know they're like discussing things

15390
07:14:59,150 --> 07:14:59,160
you know they're like discussing things
 

15391
07:14:59,160 --> 07:15:02,570
you know they're like discussing things
and they don't just like go and send out

15392
07:15:02,570 --> 07:15:02,580
and they don't just like go and send out
 

15393
07:15:02,580 --> 07:15:05,628
and they don't just like go and send out
the the requests to do it I think they

15394
07:15:05,628 --> 07:15:05,638
the the requests to do it I think they
 

15395
07:15:05,638 --> 07:15:09,468
the the requests to do it I think they
wanted the the concept first

15396
07:15:09,468 --> 07:15:09,478
wanted the the concept first
 

15397
07:15:09,478 --> 07:15:11,510
wanted the the concept first
so I had to make the plan first and then

15398
07:15:11,510 --> 07:15:11,520
so I had to make the plan first and then
 

15399
07:15:11,520 --> 07:15:14,090
so I had to make the plan first and then
we presented to the artist and they

15400

we presented to the artist and they
 

15401
07:15:14,100 --> 07:15:20,060
we presented to the artist and they
think about if they want to do it

15402
07:15:20,060 --> 07:15:20,070

15476
07:16:59,330 --> 07:16:59,340
in the end we still kind of got
 

15477
07:16:59,340 --> 07:17:03,350
in the end we still kind of got
something similar to that in in some way

something similar to that in in some way
 

15479
07:17:03,360 --> 07:17:04,310
something similar to that in in some way
um

um
 

15481
07:17:04,320 --> 07:17:05,990
um
but yeah since it took me so long to

15482
07:17:05,990 --> 07:17:06,000
but yeah since it took me so long to
 

15483
07:17:06,000 --> 07:17:08,570
but yeah since it took me so long to
even get to the point of finding an

15484
07:17:08,570 --> 07:17:08,580
even get to the point of finding an
 

15485
07:17:08,580 --> 07:17:10,128
even get to the point of finding an
artist

15486
07:17:10,128 --> 07:17:10,138
artist
 

15487
07:17:10,138 --> 07:17:13,670

that's when everybody already
 

15489
07:17:13,680 --> 07:17:16,850
that's when everybody already
probably put like reached unless they

15490
07:17:16,850 --> 07:17:16,860
probably put like reached unless they
 

15491
07:17:16,860 --> 07:17:19,250
probably put like reached unless they
unless they just wasted a lot of time

15492
07:17:19,250 --> 07:17:19,260
unless they just wasted a lot of time
 

15493
07:17:19,260 --> 07:17:22,430
unless they just wasted a lot of time
but I don't think so because I saw I saw

15494
07:17:22,430 --> 07:17:22,440
but I don't think so because I saw I saw
 

15495
07:17:22,440 --> 07:17:27,948
but I don't think so because I saw I saw
drafts very early from Ahmed too

15496
07:17:27,948 --> 07:17:27,958

 

15497
07:17:27,958 --> 07:17:29,990

the last because I was so behind on
 

15501
07:17:31,920 --> 07:17:33,948
the last because I was so behind on

15502
07:17:33,948 --> 07:17:33,958
creation process
 

15503
07:17:33,958 --> 07:17:38,570
creation process
mm-hmm

15504
07:17:38,570 --> 07:17:38,580

 

15505

15509
07:17:43,138 --> 07:17:45,128
he was definitely working fast and he
was motivated

15510
07:17:45,128 --> 07:17:45,138
was motivated
 

15511
07:17:45,138 --> 07:17:51,350
was motivated
and he was excited I could feel it

15512
07:17:51,350 --> 07:17:51,360

 

15513
07:17:51,360 --> 07:17:53,030

I would ask her something and he would

15514

I would ask her something and he would
 

15515
07:17:53,040 --> 07:17:54,708
I would ask her something and he would
implement it but the only problem was

15516
07:17:54,708 --> 07:17:54,718
implement it but the only problem was
 

15517
07:17:54,718 --> 07:17:56,030
implement it but the only problem was
that

15518
07:17:56,030 --> 07:17:56,040
that
 

15519
07:17:56,040 --> 07:17:59,030
that
what I would get back is the draft

15520
07:17:59,030 --> 07:17:59,040
what I would get back is the draft
 

15521
07:17:59,040 --> 07:18:00,708
what I would get back is the draft
overworked with the implemented things

overworked with the implemented things
 

15523
07:18:00,718 --> 07:18:02,390
overworked with the implemented things
that I asked for but he would also like

15524
07:18:02,390 --> 07:18:02,400
that I asked for but he would also like
 

15525

just like he was constantly overworking

15538
07:18:18,350 --> 07:18:18,360
just like he was constantly overworking
 

15539
07:18:18,360 --> 07:18:20,030
just like he was constantly overworking
everything every time I got the draft

15540
07:18:20,030 --> 07:18:20,040
everything every time I got the draft
 

15541
07:18:20,040 --> 07:18:25,968
everything every time I got the draft
back it looked so different to me

15542
07:18:25,968 --> 07:18:25,978

 

15543
07:18:25,978 --> 07:18:28,430

yeah it was a bit difficult because all

15544
07:18:28,430 --> 07:18:28,440
yeah it was a bit difficult because all
 

15545
07:18:28,440 --> 07:18:30,830
yeah it was a bit difficult because all
