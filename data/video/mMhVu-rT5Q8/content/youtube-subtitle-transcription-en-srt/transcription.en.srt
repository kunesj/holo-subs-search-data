no no more floors lava

2876
01:46:41,310 --> 01:46:41,320

 

2877

hi yeah and then uh we M I think we

2882
01:46:54,830 --> 01:46:54,840
hi yeah and then uh we M I think we
 

2883
01:46:54,840 --> 01:46:57,950
hi yeah and then uh we M I think we
started uh some more

2884
01:46:57,950 --> 01:46:57,960
started uh some more
 

2885
01:46:57,960 --> 01:47:00,310
started uh some more
reading

2886
01:47:00,310 --> 01:47:00,320
reading
 

2887
01:47:00,320 --> 01:47:03,629
reading
practice and

2888
01:47:03,629 --> 01:47:03,639
practice and
 

2889
01:47:03,639 --> 01:47:06,589
practice and
then I think then we moved on to like

2890
01:47:06,589 --> 01:47:06,599
then I think then we moved on to like
 

2891
01:47:06,599 --> 01:47:18,550
then I think then we moved on to like
already learning how to build

2892
01:47:18,550 --> 01:47:18,560

 

2893
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:22,589

sentences and she told me that in Korean

2894
01:47:22,589 --> 01:47:22,599
sentences and she told me that in Korean
 

2895
01:47:22,599 --> 01:47:25,430
sentences and she told me that in Korean
you always ends the sentence with a verb

2896
01:47:25,430 --> 01:47:25,440
you always ends the sentence with a verb
 

2897
01:47:25,440 --> 01:47:27,149
you always ends the sentence with a verb
so no matter what it always ends with a

2898
01:47:27,149 --> 01:47:27,159
so no matter what it always ends with a
 

2899
01:47:27,159 --> 01:47:29,310
so no matter what it always ends with a
verb so subject and then

2900
01:47:29,310 --> 01:47:29,320
verb so subject and then
 

2901
01:47:29,320 --> 01:47:32,229
verb so subject and then
verb and that well I think on the

2902
01:47:32,229 --> 01:47:32,239
verb and that well I think on the
 

2903
01:47:32,239 --> 01:47:34,830
verb and that well I think on the
language I've learned it's very similar

2904
01:47:34,830 --> 01:47:34,840
language I've learned it's very similar
 

2905
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:39,310
language I've learned it's very similar
so that's not too difficult to remember

2906
01:47:39,310 --> 01:47:39,320
so that's not too difficult to remember
 

2907
01:47:39,320 --> 01:47:41,550
so that's not too difficult to remember
that that's not a problem and actually

2908
01:47:41,550 --> 01:47:41,560
that that's not a problem and actually
 

2909
01:47:41,560 --> 01:47:44,109
that that's not a problem and actually
quite easy to remember it just always

2910
01:47:44,109 --> 01:47:44,119
quite easy to remember it just always
 

2911
01:47:44,119 --> 01:47:44,970
quite easy to remember it just always
follows that

2912
01:47:44,970 --> 01:47:44,980
follows that
 

2913
01:47:44,980 --> 01:47:47,709
follows that

and then she told me that uh there's

2920
01:47:55,430 --> 01:47:55,440
and then she told me that uh there's
 

2921
01:47:55,440 --> 01:48:00,390
and then she told me that uh there's
like uh markers after a subject and

2922
01:48:00,390 --> 01:48:00,400
like uh markers after a subject and
 

2923
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:03,430
like uh markers after a subject and
after verb and

2924
01:48:03,430 --> 01:48:03,440
after verb and
 

2925
01:48:03,440 --> 01:48:06,109
after verb and
after what was the other thing that I

2926
01:48:06,109 --> 01:48:06,119
after what was the other thing that I
 

2927
01:48:06,119 --> 01:48:09,270
after what was the other thing that I
wrote down I forgot I forgot but you

2928
01:48:09,270 --> 01:48:09,280
wrote down I forgot I forgot but you
 

2929
01:48:09,280 --> 01:48:13,910
wrote down I forgot I forgot but you
always have to uh end something with uh

2930
01:48:13,910 --> 01:48:13,920
always have to uh end something with uh
 

2931
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:16,229
always have to uh end something with uh
like a for example subject marker so

2932
01:48:16,229 --> 01:48:16,239
like a for example subject marker so
 

2933
01:48:16,239 --> 01:48:22,270
like a for example subject marker so
kiar or or like eggy eggy baby uh it

2934
01:48:22,270 --> 01:48:22,280
kiar or or like eggy eggy baby uh it
 

2935
01:48:22,280 --> 01:48:26,149
kiar or or like eggy eggy baby uh it
will end Ed K and eggy ends in a

2936
01:48:26,149 --> 01:48:26,159
will end Ed K and eggy ends in a
 

2937
01:48:26,159 --> 01:48:29,990
will end Ed K and eggy ends in a
vowel so that he would end with

2938
01:48:29,990 --> 01:48:30,000
vowel so that he would end with
 

2939
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:31,910
vowel so that he would end with
depending on if it ends in a vowel or

2940
01:48:31,910 --> 01:48:31,920
depending on if it ends in a vowel or
 

2941
01:48:31,920 --> 01:48:34,310
depending on if it ends in a vowel or
the other thing what a consonant I don't

2942
01:48:34,310 --> 01:48:34,320
the other thing what a consonant I don't
 

2943
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:36,750
the other thing what a consonant I don't
know all these fancy words you have

2944
01:48:36,750 --> 01:48:36,760
know all these fancy words you have
 

2945
01:48:36,760 --> 01:48:40,830
know all these fancy words you have
different ways to add things so for

2946
01:48:40,830 --> 01:48:40,840
different ways to add things so for
 

2947
01:48:40,840 --> 01:48:46,310
different ways to add things so for
example un and n and uh she I think I

2948
01:48:46,310 --> 01:48:46,320
example un and n and uh she I think I
 

2949
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:48,430
example un and n and uh she I think I
need to repeat I just learned this so I

2950
01:48:48,430 --> 01:48:48,440
need to repeat I just learned this so I
 

2951
01:48:48,440 --> 01:48:51,149
need to repeat I just learned this so I
need to repeat that that stuff to learn

2952
01:48:51,149 --> 01:48:51,159
need to repeat that that stuff to learn
 

2953
01:48:51,159 --> 01:48:54,229
need to repeat that that stuff to learn
it uh and remember

2954
01:48:54,229 --> 01:48:54,239
it uh and remember
 

2955
01:48:54,239 --> 01:48:58,070
it uh and remember
it yeah but I've heard it many times it

2956
01:48:58,070 --> 01:48:58,080
it yeah but I've heard it many times it
 

2957
01:48:58,080 --> 01:49:01,430
it yeah but I've heard it many times it
seems pretty pretty reasonable so I I

2958
01:49:01,430 --> 01:49:01,440
seems pretty pretty reasonable so I I
 

2959
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:03,430
seems pretty pretty reasonable so I I
learned the same thing

2960
01:49:03,430 --> 01:49:03,440
learned the same thing
 

2961
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:08,750
learned the same thing
for for the verbs as well you have to

2962
01:49:08,750 --> 01:49:08,760
for for the verbs as well you have to

around the Sun chamber due to flag or
 

5081
03:00:58,640 --> 03:01:00,910
around the Sun chamber due to flag or
blocking off the shortest way in Oh you

5082
03:01:00,910 --> 03:01:00,920
blocking off the shortest way in Oh you
 

5083
03:01:00,920 --> 03:01:07,630
blocking off the shortest way in Oh you
mean that this way is not possible to

5084
03:01:07,630 --> 03:01:07,640

 

5085
03:01:07,640 --> 03:01:11,269
