with her
 

5617
02:42:11,880 --> 02:42:16,070
with her
I think I invited her

5618
02:42:16,070 --> 02:42:16,080

 

5619
02:42:16,080 --> 02:42:17,990

I'm thinking maybe we can do that again

5620
02:42:17,990 --> 02:42:18,000
I'm thinking maybe we can do that again
 

5621
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:20,510
I'm thinking maybe we can do that again
because it will be cold Seasons or maybe

5622
02:42:20,510 --> 02:42:20,520
because it will be cold Seasons or maybe
 

5623
02:42:20,520 --> 02:42:22,550
because it will be cold Seasons or maybe
on Onsen

5624
02:42:22,550 --> 02:42:22,560
on Onsen
 

5625
02:42:22,560 --> 02:42:26,469
on Onsen
kind of place would be nice

5626
02:42:26,469 --> 02:42:26,479

 

5627
02:42:26,479 --> 02:42:29,330

but I'm not sure about it yet I have to

5628
02:42:29,330 --> 02:42:29,340
but I'm not sure about it yet I have to
 

5629
02:42:29,340 --> 02:42:31,190
but I'm not sure about it yet I have to
like sit down and

5630
02:42:31,190 --> 02:42:31,200
like sit down and
 

5631
02:42:31,200 --> 02:42:34,070
like sit down and
plan everything out more properly but

5632
02:42:34,070 --> 02:42:34,080
plan everything out more properly but
 

5633
02:42:34,080 --> 02:42:37,429
plan everything out more properly but
like I don't I don't want to have a

5634
02:42:37,429 --> 02:42:37,439
like I don't I don't want to have a
 

5635
02:42:37,439 --> 02:42:41,450
like I don't I don't want to have a
booking for like a month in Tokyo

5636
02:42:41,450 --> 02:42:41,460
booking for like a month in Tokyo
 

5637
02:42:41,460 --> 02:42:44,330
booking for like a month in Tokyo
and then overlap it with like two or

5638
02:42:44,330 --> 02:42:44,340
and then overlap it with like two or
 

5639
02:42:44,340 --> 02:42:46,370
and then overlap it with like two or
three nights somewhere else because then

5640
02:42:46,370 --> 02:42:46,380
three nights somewhere else because then
 

5641
02:42:46,380 --> 02:42:48,170
three nights somewhere else because then
I'll be paying double and I want to

5642
02:42:48,170 --> 02:42:48,180
I'll be paying double and I want to
 

5643
02:42:48,180 --> 02:42:51,290
I'll be paying double and I want to
avoid that

5644
02:42:51,290 --> 02:42:51,300

 

5645
02:42:51,300 --> 02:42:54,410

so I'm not sure about my accommodation

5646
02:42:54,410 --> 02:42:54,420
so I'm not sure about my accommodation
 

5647
02:42:54,420 --> 02:42:57,050
so I'm not sure about my accommodation
situation right now

5648
02:42:57,050 --> 02:42:57,060
situation right now
 

5649
02:42:57,060 --> 02:43:03,050
situation right now
uh

5650
02:43:03,050 --> 02:43:03,060

 

5651
02:43:03,060 --> 02:43:09,110

but I'm getting there

5652
02:43:09,110 --> 02:43:09,120

 

5653
02:43:09,120 --> 02:43:11,150

look member's not your sleepover some of

5654
02:43:11,150 --> 02:43:11,160
look member's not your sleepover some of
 

5655
02:43:11,160 --> 02:43:12,770
look member's not your sleepover some of
them maybe but I'm definitely not gonna

5656
02:43:12,770 --> 02:43:12,780
them maybe but I'm definitely not gonna
 

5657
02:43:12,780 --> 02:43:15,110
them maybe but I'm definitely not gonna
rely on it the whole time

5658
02:43:15,110 --> 02:43:15,120
rely on it the whole time
 

5659
02:43:15,120 --> 02:43:18,050
rely on it the whole time
because yeah

5660
02:43:18,050 --> 02:43:18,060
because yeah
 

5661
02:43:18,060 --> 02:43:20,929
because yeah
even even if I say okay this day I'll

5662
02:43:20,929 --> 02:43:20,939
even even if I say okay this day I'll
 

5663
02:43:20,939 --> 02:43:23,510
even even if I say okay this day I'll
sleep over at Madison park's place so I

5664
02:43:23,510 --> 02:43:23,520
sleep over at Madison park's place so I
 

5665
02:43:23,520 --> 02:43:26,870
sleep over at Madison park's place so I
don't book a hotel for that night then

5666
02:43:26,870 --> 02:43:26,880
don't book a hotel for that night then
 

5667
02:43:26,880 --> 02:43:28,910
don't book a hotel for that night then
uh

5668
02:43:28,910 --> 02:43:28,920
uh
 

5669
02:43:28,920 --> 02:43:30,770
uh
it kind of sucks because if I don't book

5670
02:43:30,770 --> 02:43:30,780
it kind of sucks because if I don't book
 

5671
02:43:30,780 --> 02:43:32,150
it kind of sucks because if I don't book
a hotel for the night I have to bring

5672
02:43:32,150 --> 02:43:32,160
a hotel for the night I have to bring
 

5673
02:43:32,160 --> 02:43:33,469
a hotel for the night I have to bring
first of all I have to bring all my

5674
02:43:33,469 --> 02:43:33,479
first of all I have to bring all my
 

5675
02:43:33,479 --> 02:43:34,429
first of all I have to bring all my
luggage

5676
02:43:34,429 --> 02:43:34,439
luggage
 

5677
02:43:34,439 --> 02:43:36,349
luggage
away from that hotel and bring it to

5678
02:43:36,349 --> 02:43:36,359
away from that hotel and bring it to
 

5679
02:43:36,359 --> 02:43:37,969
away from that hotel and bring it to
Martin Center and I'll probably bring a

5680
02:43:37,969 --> 02:43:37,979
Martin Center and I'll probably bring a
 

5681
02:43:37,979 --> 02:43:40,670
Martin Center and I'll probably bring a
lot of luggage for a whole month

5682
02:43:40,670 --> 02:43:40,680
lot of luggage for a whole month
 

5683
02:43:40,680 --> 02:43:42,170
lot of luggage for a whole month
and then the other problem is what if

5684
02:43:42,170 --> 02:43:42,180
and then the other problem is what if
 

5685
02:43:42,180 --> 02:43:44,630
and then the other problem is what if
she moves it what if she says oh can we

5686
02:43:44,630 --> 02:43:44,640
she moves it what if she says oh can we
 

5687
02:43:44,640 --> 02:43:47,090
she moves it what if she says oh can we
move it to another day and then

5688
02:43:47,090 --> 02:43:47,100
move it to another day and then
 

5689
02:43:47,100 --> 02:43:49,070
move it to another day and then
I have to book another hotel for just

5690
02:43:49,070 --> 02:43:49,080
I have to book another hotel for just
 

5691
02:43:49,080 --> 02:43:51,050
I have to book another hotel for just
one night and currently Tokyo Hotel

5692
02:43:51,050 --> 02:43:51,060
one night and currently Tokyo Hotel
 

5693
02:43:51,060 --> 02:43:54,349
one night and currently Tokyo Hotel
situation is pretty crowded so then I

5694
02:43:54,349 --> 02:43:54,359
situation is pretty crowded so then I
 

5695
02:43:54,359 --> 02:43:55,429
situation is pretty crowded so then I
probably wouldn't even be able to get

5696
02:43:55,429 --> 02:43:55,439
probably wouldn't even be able to get
 

5697
02:43:55,439 --> 02:43:56,990
probably wouldn't even be able to get
the same Hotel so I'll have to switch

5698
02:43:56,990 --> 02:43:57,000
the same Hotel so I'll have to switch
 

5699
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:58,550
the same Hotel so I'll have to switch
hotels just for one night and all that

5700
02:43:58,550 --> 02:43:58,560
hotels just for one night and all that
 

5701
02:43:58,560 --> 02:44:00,050
hotels just for one night and all that
kind of sucks

5702
02:44:00,050 --> 02:44:00,060
kind of sucks
 

5703
02:44:00,060 --> 02:44:03,349
kind of sucks
so yeah

5704
02:44:03,349 --> 02:44:03,359

 

5705
02:44:03,359 --> 02:44:05,450

not ideal

5706
02:44:05,450 --> 02:44:05,460
not ideal
 

5707
02:44:05,460 --> 02:44:08,090
not ideal
why not just Bank of Cali no that again

5708
02:44:08,090 --> 02:44:08,100
why not just Bank of Cali no that again
 

5709
02:44:08,100 --> 02:44:10,070
why not just Bank of Cali no that again

03:53:48,060 --> 03:53:49,969

attack it will be also effective against

04:01:06,660 --> 04:01:09,050
apparently it's better
but I didn't feel like it would be

8402
04:01:09,050 --> 04:01:09,060
but I didn't feel like it would be
 

8403
04:01:09,060 --> 04:01:12,769
but I didn't feel like it would be
better for me because I had no control

8404
04:01:12,769 --> 04:01:12,779
better for me because I had no control
 

8405
04:01:12,779 --> 04:01:16,849
better for me because I had no control
over my curves

8406
04:01:16,849 --> 04:01:16,859

 

8407
04:01:16,859 --> 04:01:19,010

so I don't see how it's better I don't

8408
04:01:19,010 --> 04:01:19,020
so I don't see how it's better I don't
 

8409
04:01:19,020 --> 04:01:21,349
so I don't see how it's better I don't
get it so the problem at that place was

8410
04:01:21,349 --> 04:01:21,359
get it so the problem at that place was
 

8411
04:01:21,359 --> 04:01:23,689
get it so the problem at that place was
we were in Hokkaido and we went to the

8412
04:01:23,689 --> 04:01:23,699
we were in Hokkaido and we went to the
 

8413
04:01:23,699 --> 04:01:25,189
we were in Hokkaido and we went to the
closest

8414
04:01:25,189 --> 04:01:25,199
closest
 

8415
04:01:25,199 --> 04:01:27,290
closest
we went sampled we went to the closest

8416
04:01:27,290 --> 04:01:27,300
we went sampled we went to the closest
 

8417
04:01:27,300 --> 04:01:29,830
we went sampled we went to the closest
uh skiing area

8418
04:01:29,830 --> 04:01:29,840
uh skiing area
 

8419
04:01:29,840 --> 04:01:32,990
uh skiing area
and I mean I don't know how much

8420
04:01:32,990 --> 04:01:33,000
and I mean I don't know how much
 

8421
04:01:33,000 --> 04:01:35,929
and I mean I don't know how much
difference it would have made but my rmt

8422
04:01:35,929 --> 04:01:35,939
difference it would have made but my rmt
 

8423
04:01:35,939 --> 04:01:37,910
difference it would have made but my rmt
also told me that one issue would have

8424
04:01:37,910 --> 04:01:37,920
also told me that one issue would have
 

8425
04:01:37,920 --> 04:01:41,269
also told me that one issue would have
been probably that we re-rented

8426
04:01:41,269 --> 04:01:41,279
been probably that we re-rented
 

8427
04:01:41,279 --> 04:01:45,050
been probably that we re-rented
our equipment everything

8428
04:01:45,050 --> 04:01:45,060
our equipment everything
 

8429
04:01:45,060 --> 04:01:47,450
our equipment everything
and the skis the length of it is very

8430
04:01:47,450 --> 04:01:47,460
and the skis the length of it is very
 

8431
04:01:47,460 --> 04:01:49,910
and the skis the length of it is very
important but also

8432
04:01:49,910 --> 04:01:49,920
important but also
 

8433
04:01:49,920 --> 04:01:51,290
important but also
um

8434
04:01:51,290 --> 04:01:51,300
um
 

8435
04:01:51,300 --> 04:01:54,590
um
like how the quality of it is and how

8436
04:01:54,590 --> 04:01:54,600
like how the quality of it is and how
 

8437
04:01:54,600 --> 04:01:56,150
like how the quality of it is and how
much it's been used and if it's from a

8438
04:01:56,150 --> 04:01:56,160
much it's been used and if it's from a
 

8439
04:01:56,160 --> 04:01:57,650
much it's been used and if it's from a
rental place

8440
04:01:57,650 --> 04:01:57,660
rental place
 

8441
04:01:57,660 --> 04:01:59,689
rental place
you can guess it's been used a million

8442
04:01:59,689 --> 04:01:59,699
you can guess it's been used a million
 

8443
04:01:59,699 --> 04:02:02,030
you can guess it's been used a million
times especially because we when we were

8444
04:02:02,030 --> 04:02:02,040
times especially because we when we were
 

8445
04:02:02,040 --> 04:02:03,830
times especially because we when we were
there we saw

8446
04:02:03,830 --> 04:02:03,840
there we saw
 

8447
04:02:03,840 --> 04:02:07,130
there we saw
huge a huge School group

8448
04:02:07,130 --> 04:02:07,140
huge a huge School group
 

8449
04:02:07,140 --> 04:02:10,189
huge a huge School group
renting stuff from there

8450
04:02:10,189 --> 04:02:10,199
renting stuff from there
 

8451
04:02:10,199 --> 04:02:12,710
renting stuff from there
like I think it was like it looked like

8452
04:02:12,710 --> 04:02:12,720
like I think it was like it looked like
 

8453
04:02:12,720 --> 04:02:16,849
like I think it was like it looked like
150 people or so

8454
04:02:16,849 --> 04:02:16,859

 

8455
04:02:16,859 --> 04:02:19,790

so if that's a normal thing there then

8456
04:02:19,790 --> 04:02:19,800
so if that's a normal thing there then
 

8457
04:02:19,800 --> 04:02:22,429
so if that's a normal thing there then
imagine how many people use those skis

8458
04:02:22,429 --> 04:02:22,439
imagine how many people use those skis
 

8459
04:02:22,439 --> 04:02:24,830
imagine how many people use those skis
before and yeah

8460
04:02:24,830 --> 04:02:24,840
before and yeah
 

8461
04:02:24,840 --> 04:02:27,889
before and yeah
that might really impact

8462
04:02:27,889 --> 04:02:27,899
that might really impact
 

8463
04:02:27,899 --> 04:02:31,990
that might really impact
it's I need to

8464
04:02:31,990 --> 04:02:32,000

 

8465
04:02:32,000 --> 04:02:33,830

confronting Christ is a common problem

8466
04:02:33,830 --> 04:02:33,840
confronting Christ is a common problem
 

8467
04:02:33,840 --> 04:02:36,290
confronting Christ is a common problem
for you yeah wait what you mean my own

8468
04:02:36,290 --> 04:02:36,300
for you yeah wait what you mean my own
 

8469
04:02:36,300 --> 04:02:37,670
for you yeah wait what you mean my own
curves

8470
04:02:37,670 --> 04:02:37,680
curves
 

8471
04:02:37,680 --> 04:02:44,750
curves
[Laughter]

8472
04:02:44,750 --> 04:02:44,760

 

8473
04:02:44,760 --> 04:02:46,490

they may have not maintained it yeah

8474
04:02:46,490 --> 04:02:46,500
they may have not maintained it yeah
 

8475
04:02:46,500 --> 04:02:49,309
they may have not maintained it yeah
yeah it's just too much to maintain like

8476
04:02:49,309 --> 04:02:49,319
yeah it's just too much to maintain like
 

8477
04:02:49,319 --> 04:02:52,189
yeah it's just too much to maintain like
I saw the selection they had

8478
04:02:52,189 --> 04:02:52,199
I saw the selection they had
 

8479
04:02:52,199 --> 04:02:55,130
I saw the selection they had
they had a lot of stuff but uh

8480
04:02:55,130 --> 04:02:55,140
they had a lot of stuff but uh
 

8481
04:02:55,140 --> 04:02:58,189
they had a lot of stuff but uh
yeah I also think the shoes that I got

8482
04:02:58,189 --> 04:02:58,199
yeah I also think the shoes that I got
 

8483
04:02:58,199 --> 04:03:01,670
yeah I also think the shoes that I got
maybe were a little bit too big

8484
04:03:01,670 --> 04:03:01,680
maybe were a little bit too big
 

8485
04:03:01,680 --> 04:03:04,309
maybe were a little bit too big
that's also a big problem if you don't

8486
04:03:04,309 --> 04:03:04,319
that's also a big problem if you don't
 

8487
04:03:04,319 --> 04:03:06,410
that's also a big problem if you don't
feel like you have

8488
04:03:06,410 --> 04:03:06,420
feel like you have
 

8489
04:03:06,420 --> 04:03:10,429
feel like you have
perfect grip in your shoes

8490
04:03:10,429 --> 04:03:10,439
perfect grip in your shoes
 

8491
04:03:10,439 --> 04:03:13,189
perfect grip in your shoes
that can ruin everything

8492
04:03:13,189 --> 04:03:13,199
that can ruin everything
 

8493
04:03:13,199 --> 04:03:15,530
that can ruin everything
so oh

8494
04:03:15,530 --> 04:03:15,540
so oh
 

8495
04:03:15,540 --> 04:03:18,229
so oh
I killed the Pokemon I know it

8496
04:03:18,229 --> 04:03:18,239
I killed the Pokemon I know it
 

8497
04:03:18,239 --> 04:03:21,889
I killed the Pokemon I know it
it's funny

8498
04:03:21,889 --> 04:03:21,899

 

8499
04:03:21,899 --> 04:03:24,170

well at least you know with my own

8500
04:03:24,170 --> 04:03:24,180
well at least you know with my own
 

8501
04:03:24,180 --> 04:03:25,969
well at least you know with my own
equipment you will think that I would be

8502
04:03:25,969 --> 04:03:25,979
equipment you will think that I would be
 

8503
04:03:25,979 --> 04:03:29,090
equipment you will think that I would be
fine but then you know at the store I

8504
04:03:29,090 --> 04:03:29,100
fine but then you know at the store I
 

8505
04:03:29,100 --> 04:03:31,130
fine but then you know at the store I
bought I bought the skiers that are like

8506
04:03:31,130 --> 04:03:31,140
bought I bought the skiers that are like
 

8507
04:03:31,140 --> 04:03:34,550
bought I bought the skiers that are like
good but then I learned later on if you

8508
04:03:34,550 --> 04:03:34,560
good but then I learned later on if you
 

8509
04:03:34,560 --> 04:03:36,469
good but then I learned later on if you
remember that

8510
04:03:36,469 --> 04:03:36,479
remember that
 

8511
04:03:36,479 --> 04:03:39,469
remember that
smaller skis would have been shorter

8512
04:03:39,469 --> 04:03:39,479
smaller skis would have been shorter
 

8513
04:03:39,479 --> 04:03:42,889
smaller skis would have been shorter
skis would have been way better for me

8514
04:03:42,889 --> 04:03:42,899
skis would have been way better for me
 

8515
04:03:42,899 --> 04:03:45,530
skis would have been way better for me
they did feel way better when I tried

8516
04:03:45,530 --> 04:03:45,540
they did feel way better when I tried
 

8517
04:03:45,540 --> 04:03:47,510
they did feel way better when I tried
them on

8518
04:03:47,510 --> 04:03:47,520
them on
 

8519
04:03:47,520 --> 04:03:50,630
them on
because long longer skis are better for

8520
04:03:50,630 --> 04:03:50,640
because long longer skis are better for
 

8521
04:03:50,640 --> 04:03:52,790
because long longer skis are better for
pros but shorter skis are better for

8522
04:03:52,790 --> 04:03:52,800
pros but shorter skis are better for
 

8523
04:03:52,800 --> 04:03:57,349
pros but shorter skis are better for
bubble bubbles like me mine were way too

8524
04:03:57,349 --> 04:03:57,359
bubble bubbles like me mine were way too
 

8525
04:03:57,359 --> 04:04:01,670
bubble bubbles like me mine were way too
long way way too long yeah Mr yodel let

8526
04:04:01,670 --> 04:04:01,680
long way way too long yeah Mr yodel let
 

8527
04:04:01,680 --> 04:04:04,729
long way way too long yeah Mr yodel let
me try like several different smaller

8528
04:04:04,729 --> 04:04:04,739
me try like several different smaller
 

8529
04:04:04,739 --> 04:04:07,370
me try like several different smaller
sizes that he had

8530
04:04:07,370 --> 04:04:07,380
sizes that he had
 

8531
04:04:07,380 --> 04:04:10,550
sizes that he had
and that was that made already a lot of

8532
04:04:10,550 --> 04:04:10,560
and that was that made already a lot of
 

8533
04:04:10,560 --> 04:04:11,950
and that was that made already a lot of
difference

8534
04:04:11,950 --> 04:04:11,960
difference
 

8535
04:04:11,960 --> 04:04:16,070
difference
but now I have these huge suckers

8536
04:04:16,070 --> 04:04:16,080
but now I have these huge suckers
 

8537
04:04:16,080 --> 04:04:19,189
but now I have these huge suckers
I probably wouldn't even bring them

8538
04:04:19,189 --> 04:04:19,199
I probably wouldn't even bring them
 

8539
04:04:19,199 --> 04:04:21,229
I probably wouldn't even bring them
if I went to skiing again because I'm

8540
04:04:21,229 --> 04:04:21,239
if I went to skiing again because I'm
 

8541
04:04:21,239 --> 04:04:23,929
if I went to skiing again because I'm
not ready for those not ready for them I

8542
04:04:23,929 --> 04:04:23,939
not ready for those not ready for them I
 

8543
04:04:23,939 --> 04:04:26,090
not ready for those not ready for them I
have to grow into them by becoming

8544
04:04:26,090 --> 04:04:26,100
have to grow into them by becoming
 

8545
04:04:26,100 --> 04:04:29,210
have to grow into them by becoming
better okay see there you go my skills

8546
04:04:29,210 --> 04:04:29,220
better okay see there you go my skills
 

8547
04:04:29,220 --> 04:04:32,750
better okay see there you go my skills
should be the reason and the motivation

8548
04:04:32,750 --> 04:04:32,760
should be the reason and the motivation
 

8549
04:04:32,760 --> 04:04:35,150
should be the reason and the motivation
to go skiing again because they cost

8550
04:04:35,150 --> 04:04:35,160
to go skiing again because they cost
 

8551
04:04:35,160 --> 04:04:39,530
to go skiing again because they cost
good money you know

8552
04:04:39,530 --> 04:04:39,540

 

8553
04:04:39,540 --> 04:04:44,889

foreign

8554
04:04:44,889 --> 04:04:44,899

8561
04:04:52,880 --> 04:04:54,889

where are we

8562
04:04:54,889 --> 04:04:54,899
where are we
 

8563
04:04:54,899 --> 04:04:58,550
where are we
oh it's there it's over there

oh it's there it's over there
 

8565
04:04:58,560 --> 04:05:05,570
oh it's there it's over there

that's pretty pretty much it so maybe
 

10175
04:48:25,320 --> 04:48:27,590
that's pretty pretty much it so maybe
they could have I don't know put

10176

they could have I don't know put
 

10177

they could have I don't know put
something somewhere

still they could have I mean accurate to
 

10195
04:49:01,500 --> 04:49:03,170

a random Snow Mountain yes but they
 

10197
04:49:03,180 --> 04:49:09,890

10199
04:49:09,900 --> 04:49:14,990

07:33:37,730 --> 07:33:37,740
then the pork fillets are usually pretty
 

16035
07:33:37,740 --> 07:33:41,990

unhappy with the amount of meat they
 

16047
07:33:55,558 --> 07:33:59,090
unhappy with the amount of meat they
give you but if it's a non-meat meal

16048
07:33:59,090 --> 07:33:59,100
give you but if it's a non-meat meal
 

16049

then often I can go for with it for
three days sometimes sometimes

16052
07:34:06,288 --> 07:34:06,298
three days sometimes sometimes
 

16053
07:34:06,298 --> 07:34:14,410
three days sometimes sometimes
but definitely easily for two days
