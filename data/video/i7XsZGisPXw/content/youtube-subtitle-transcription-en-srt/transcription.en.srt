red because red apparently someone told

2952
01:40:39,430 --> 01:40:39,440
red because red apparently someone told
 

2953
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:41,830
red because red apparently someone told
me that if you make a red border

2954
01:40:41,830 --> 01:40:41,840
me that if you make a red border
 

2955
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:45,910
me that if you make a red border
on the edge then it kind of interferes

2956
01:40:45,910 --> 01:40:45,920
on the edge then it kind of interferes
 

2957
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:46,950
on the edge then it kind of interferes
with the

the stream because that's also red

2962
01:40:51,590 --> 01:40:51,600
the stream because that's also red
 

2963
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:55,109

so maybe something like maybe blue

2964
01:40:55,109 --> 01:40:55,119
