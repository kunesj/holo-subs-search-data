some left so i think we start
 

283
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,990
some left so i think we start
the game by using up a few of those

284
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:50,000
the game by using up a few of those
 

285
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,270
the game by using up a few of those
by the way so i guess that is the

286
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:53,280
by the way so i guess that is the
 

287
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,230
by the way so i guess that is the
is that that's the grand blue fantasy uh

288
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:56,240
is that that's the grand blue fantasy uh
 

289
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,710
is that that's the grand blue fantasy uh
thing i think

290
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:58,720
thing i think
 

291
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,350
thing i think
i think because i can recognize the the

292
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:01,360
i think because i can recognize the the
 

293
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,430
i think because i can recognize the the
art style and maybe that character i

294
