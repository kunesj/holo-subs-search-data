earlier you

3238
01:23:59,790 --> 01:23:59,800
earlier you
 

3239
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:02,149
earlier you
start then that also means the longer

3240
01:24:02,149 --> 01:24:02,159

that
even what does that

5922
02:40:03,230 --> 02:40:03,240
even what does that
 

5923
02:40:03,240 --> 02:40:07,070
even what does that
do not sure and the voice over makes me

5924
02:40:07,070 --> 02:40:07,080
do not sure and the voice over makes me
 

5925
02:40:07,080 --> 02:40:08,510
do not sure and the voice over makes me
think

5926
02:40:08,510 --> 02:40:08,520
think
 

5927
02:40:08,520 --> 02:40:11,510
think
that the movie is being recorded with no

5928
02:40:11,510 --> 02:40:11,520
that the movie is being recorded with no
 

5929
02:40:11,520 --> 02:40:15,830
that the movie is being recorded with no
voice and it's being added

5930
02:40:15,830 --> 02:40:15,840

 

5931
02:40:15,840 --> 02:40:18,309

afterwards but why is it why can't it

5932
02:40:18,309 --> 02:40:18,319
afterwards but why is it why can't it
 

5933
02:40:18,319 --> 02:40:21,230
afterwards but why is it why can't it
not be her

5934
02:40:21,230 --> 02:40:21,240
not be her
 

5935
02:40:21,240 --> 02:40:24,790
not be her

or is the pro voiceover like a narration
 

5937
02:40:24,800 --> 02:40:26,910
or is the pro voiceover like a narration
maybe we'll never know because that's

5938
02:40:26,910 --> 02:40:26,920
maybe we'll never know because that's
 

5939
02:40:26,920 --> 02:40:30,990
maybe we'll never know because that's
not what I'm

5940
02:40:30,990 --> 02:40:31,000

 

5941
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:33,790

doing actually this makes no sense we

5942
02:40:33,790 --> 02:40:33,800
doing actually this makes no sense we
 

5943
02:40:33,800 --> 02:40:36,150
doing actually this makes no sense we
just do a general audiences because more

5944
02:40:36,150 --> 02:40:36,160
just do a general audiences because more
 

5945
02:40:36,160 --> 02:40:39,670
just do a general audiences because more
people will be able to see

5946
02:40:39,670 --> 02:40:39,680

 

5947
02:40:39,680 --> 02:40:44,230

it for now that makes more

5948
02:40:44,230 --> 02:40:44,240

 

5949
02:40:44,240 --> 02:40:46,150

sense

5950
02:40:46,150 --> 02:40:46,160
sense
 

5951
02:40:46,160 --> 02:40:48,710

9059
04:09:21,080 --> 04:09:27,790

people can they walk through

9060
04:09:27,790 --> 04:09:27,800

 

9061
04:09:27,800 --> 04:09:31,030

probably is this like I wonder if this

9062
04:09:31,030 --> 04:09:31,040
probably is this like I wonder if this
 

9063
04:09:31,040 --> 04:09:33,870
probably is this like I wonder if this
is necessary like one one per marketer

9064
04:09:33,870 --> 04:09:33,880
is necessary like one one per marketer
 

9065
04:09:33,880 --> 04:09:38,429
is necessary like one one per marketer
but I'll at least put one more

9066
04:09:38,429 --> 04:09:38,439

 

9067
04:09:38,439 --> 04:09:41,950

good h
 

9071
04:09:43,840 --> 04:09:45,870
good h
eventually I should probably just have

9072
04:09:45,870 --> 04:09:45,880
eventually I should probably just have
 

9073
04:09:45,880 --> 04:09:48,510
eventually I should probably just have
made bigger ones but you know it was the

9074
04:09:48,510 --> 04:09:48,520
made bigger ones but you know it was the
 

9075
04:09:48,520 --> 04:09:51,070
made bigger ones but you know it was the
beginning so you don't think that

9076
04:09:51,070 --> 04:09:51,080
beginning so you don't think that
 

9077
04:09:51,080 --> 04:09:55,269
beginning so you don't think that
far but eventually if we could like put

9078
04:09:55,269 --> 04:09:55,279
far but eventually if we could like put
 

9079
04:09:55,279 --> 04:09:58,149
far but eventually if we could like put
five producers or so into one room like

9080
04:09:58,149 --> 04:09:58,159
five producers or so into one room like
 

9081
04:09:58,159 --> 04:10:05,790
five producers or so into one room like
this that would be

9082
04:10:05,790 --> 04:10:05,800

 

9083
04:10:05,800 --> 04:10:10,910

those two were

9922
04:35:15,189 --> 04:35:15,199
those two were
 

9923
04:35:15,199 --> 04:35:25,470
those two were
brawling as I

9924
04:35:25,470 --> 04:35:25,480

 

9925
04:35:25,480 --> 04:35:29,070

remember and then one more this is not

9926
04:35:29,070 --> 04:35:29,080
remember and then one more this is not
 

9927
04:35:29,080 --> 04:35:31,470
remember and then one more this is not
in the right order now

9928
04:35:31,470 --> 04:35:31,480
in the right order now
 

9929
04:35:31,480 --> 04:35:35,429
in the right order now
obviously GAA and yo what were they

9930
04:35:35,429 --> 04:35:35,439
obviously GAA and yo what were they
 

9931
04:35:35,439 --> 04:35:38,869
obviously GAA and yo what were they
doing were they having a sword fight or

9932
04:35:38,869 --> 04:35:38,879
doing were they having a sword fight or
 

9933
04:35:38,879 --> 04:35:40,789
doing were they having a sword fight or
no I think I made them do the Western

9934
04:35:40,789 --> 04:35:40,799
no I think I made them do the Western
 

9935
04:35:40,799 --> 04:35:44,789
no I think I made them do the Western
Duell at first

9936
04:35:44,789 --> 04:35:44,799

 

9937
04:35:44,799 --> 04:35:47,750

maybe she's the one who stabs him right

9938
04:35:47,750 --> 04:35:47,760
maybe she's the one who stabs him right
 

9939
04:35:47,760 --> 04:35:50,750
maybe she's the one who stabs him right
so sword fight would make somewhat

9940
04:35:50,750 --> 04:35:50,760
so sword fight would make somewhat
 

9941
04:35:50,760 --> 04:35:56,109
so sword fight would make somewhat
sense

9942
04:35:56,109 --> 04:35:56,119

 

9943
04:35:56,119 --> 04:36:02,189

maybe

9944
04:36:02,189 --> 04:36:02,199

 

9945
04:36:02,199 --> 04:36:06,349

maybe let's do the

9946
04:36:06,349 --> 04:36:06,359

 

9947
04:36:06,359 --> 04:36:10,029

9949
04:36:10,039 --> 04:36:15,709

that's not really

9950
04:36:15,709 --> 04:36:15,719

 

9951
04:36:15,719 --> 04:36:18,750

9952
04:36:18,750 --> 04:36:18,760

next he dies so many

10218
04:44:45,708 --> 04:44:45,718
next he dies so many
 

10219
04:44:45,718 --> 04:44:49,390

times okay I think this one should be

10220
04:44:49,390 --> 04:44:49,400
times okay I think this one should be
 

10221
04:44:49,400 --> 04:44:58,110
times okay I think this one should be
next and in that scene he does

10222
04:44:58,110 --> 04:44:58,120

 

10223
04:44:58,120 --> 04:45:02,110

10227
04:45:03,920 --> 04:45:08,590
