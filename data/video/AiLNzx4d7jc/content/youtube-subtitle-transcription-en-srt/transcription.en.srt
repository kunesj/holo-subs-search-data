6341
02:45:29,240 --> 02:45:30,950

think K-pop style fan chance will work

6342
02:45:30,950 --> 02:45:30,960
think K-pop style fan chance will work
 

6343
02:45:30,960 --> 02:45:39,389
think K-pop style fan chance will work
better for Mirage so I look into

6344
02:45:39,389 --> 02:45:39,399

 

6345
02:45:39,399 --> 02:45:42,550

it now during K-pop they like chanted in

6349
02:45:45,600 --> 02:45:47,070
the beginning during Jpop usually when
there's an idle group of different

6350
02:45:47,070 --> 02:45:47,080
there's an idle group of different
 

6351
02:45:47,080 --> 02:45:49,710
there's an idle group of different
members when they get solo line after

6352
02:45:49,710 --> 02:45:49,720
members when they get solo line after
 

6353
02:45:49,720 --> 02:45:53,349
members when they get solo line after
one solo line they will scream like the

6354
02:45:53,349 --> 02:45:53,359
one solo line they will scream like the
 

6355
02:45:53,359 --> 02:45:56,950
one solo line they will scream like the
the member's name in a particular Rhythm

6356
02:45:56,950 --> 02:45:56,960
the member's name in a particular Rhythm
 

6357
02:45:56,960 --> 02:45:59,150
the member's name in a particular Rhythm
not like unorganized it feels like it's

6358
02:45:59,150 --> 02:45:59,160
not like unorganized it feels like it's
 

6359
02:45:59,160 --> 02:46:01,710
not like unorganized it feels like it's
all following the Rhythm and the flow

6360
02:46:01,710 --> 02:46:01,720
all following the Rhythm and the flow
 

6361
02:46:01,720 --> 02:46:03,590
all following the Rhythm and the flow
because Japanese songs are usually

6362
02:46:03,590 --> 02:46:03,600
because Japanese songs are usually
 

6363
02:46:03,600 --> 02:46:05,710
because Japanese songs are usually
structured in a way that gives it this

6364
02:46:05,710 --> 02:46:05,720

think but I had I timed it really badly
so I still had to like stall for four or

8906
03:54:28,910 --> 03:54:28,920
so I still had to like stall for four or
 

8907
03:54:28,920 --> 03:54:29,750
so I still had to like stall for four or
five

8908
03:54:29,750 --> 03:54:29,760
five
 

8909
03:54:29,760 --> 03:54:32,389
five
minutes yeah and then once the noodles

8910
03:54:32,389 --> 03:54:32,399
minutes yeah and then once the noodles
 

8911
03:54:32,399 --> 03:54:35,189
minutes yeah and then once the noodles
are in you add you you stir it a little

8912
03:54:35,189 --> 03:54:35,199
are in you add you you stir it a little
 

8913
03:54:35,199 --> 03:54:37,670
are in you add you you stir it a little
bit emulsify and then you add the

8914
03:54:37,670 --> 03:54:37,680
bit emulsify and then you add the
 

8915
03:54:37,680 --> 03:54:41,349
bit emulsify and then you add the
chopped parsely and that's it can add a

8916
03:54:41,349 --> 03:54:41,359
chopped parsely and that's it can add a
 

8917
03:54:41,359 --> 03:54:42,990
chopped parsely and that's it can add a
little bit of sea salt maybe or

8918
03:54:42,990 --> 03:54:43,000
little bit of sea salt maybe or
 

8919
03:54:43,000 --> 03:54:45,469
little bit of sea salt maybe or
something like that or I I didn't do it

8920
03:54:45,469 --> 03:54:45,479
something like that or I I didn't do it
 

8921
03:54:45,479 --> 03:54:46,950
something like that or I I didn't do it
this time and I think it's fine this way

8922
03:54:46,950 --> 03:54:46,960
this time and I think it's fine this way
 

8923
03:54:46,960 --> 03:54:50,110
this time and I think it's fine this way
but next time I make it I'll add um
