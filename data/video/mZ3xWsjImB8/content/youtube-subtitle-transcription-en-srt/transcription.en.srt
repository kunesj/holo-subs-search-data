both of them there's only one it's like

3020
01:07:10,730 --> 01:07:10,740
both of them there's only one it's like
 

3021
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:13,670
both of them there's only one it's like
a big one oh not like floaties like arm

3022
01:07:13,670 --> 01:07:13,680
a big one oh not like floaties like arm
 

3023
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:18,230
a big one oh not like floaties like arm
floaties like uh like the ones a pattern

3024
01:07:18,230 --> 01:07:18,240
floaties like uh like the ones a pattern
 

3025
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:20,029
floaties like uh like the ones a pattern
on it

3026
01:07:20,029 --> 01:07:20,039
on it
 

3027
01:07:20,039 --> 01:07:22,430
on it
so I mean there was like a pattern from

3028
01:07:22,430 --> 01:07:22,440
so I mean there was like a pattern from
 

3029
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:24,230

3039
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:36,710
just hot Square no how big was it like
size wise probably as tall as I am today

3040
01:07:36,710 --> 01:07:36,720
size wise probably as tall as I am today
 

3041
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:39,289
size wise probably as tall as I am today
I would say like lengths okay so it was

3042
01:07:39,289 --> 01:07:39,299
I would say like lengths okay so it was
 

3043
01:07:39,299 --> 01:07:41,990

inflatable
 

3047
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:46,670
inflatable
so were you a sufficient efficient at

3048
01:07:46,670 --> 01:07:46,680
so were you a sufficient efficient at
 

3049
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:48,950

than a half but it seems a lot like a
 

3229
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:31,729
than a half but it seems a lot like a
lot as a kid I don't know when you're

3230
01:11:31,729 --> 01:11:31,739
lot as a kid I don't know when you're
 

3231
01:11:31,739 --> 01:11:33,830
lot as a kid I don't know when you're
like seven or eight like in the middle

3232
01:11:33,830 --> 01:11:33,840
like seven or eight like in the middle
 

3233
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:36,350
like seven or eight like in the middle
like the ocean may look calm from far

3234
01:11:36,350 --> 01:11:36,360
like the ocean may look calm from far
 

3235
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:38,689
like the ocean may look calm from far
away but the waves are still pretty were

3236
01:11:38,689 --> 01:11:38,699
away but the waves are still pretty were
 

3237
01:11:38,699 --> 01:11:40,189
away but the waves are still pretty were
you scolded after that I guess we're

3238
01:11:40,189 --> 01:11:40,199
you scolded after that I guess we're
 

3239
01:11:40,199 --> 01:11:41,470
you scolded after that I guess we're
done with questioning

3240
01:11:41,470 --> 01:11:41,480
done with questioning
 

3241
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:44,950
done with questioning
I don't think so God damn it this girl

3242
01:11:44,950 --> 01:11:44,960
I don't think so God damn it this girl
 

3243
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:48,370
I don't think so God damn it this girl
did you have parents uh

3244
01:11:48,370 --> 01:11:48,380
did you have parents uh
 

3245
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:51,770
did you have parents uh
this is sort of

3246
01:11:51,770 --> 01:11:51,780
this is sort of
 

3247
01:11:51,780 --> 01:11:53,750
this is sort of
okay well I guess what Donald question

3248
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:53,760
okay well I guess what Donald question
 

3249
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:58,370
okay well I guess what Donald question
even um

3250
01:11:58,370 --> 01:11:58,380

 

3251
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:01,430

but I think like if she said it was calm

3252
01:12:01,430 --> 01:12:01,440
but I think like if she said it was calm
 

3253
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:03,169
but I think like if she said it was calm
so if if the waves are really strong

3254
01:12:03,169 --> 01:12:03,179
so if if the waves are really strong
 

3255
01:12:03,179 --> 01:12:04,550
so if if the waves are really strong
then I think it would have been very

3256
01:12:04,550 --> 01:12:04,560
then I think it would have been very
 

3257
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:06,649
then I think it would have been very
difficult for a child to get back yeah

3258
01:12:06,649 --> 01:12:06,659
difficult for a child to get back yeah
 

3259
01:12:06,659 --> 01:12:09,530
difficult for a child to get back yeah
but since it was calmer

3260
01:12:09,530 --> 01:12:09,540
but since it was calmer
 

3261
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:11,689
but since it was calmer
it was cold but the ocean even if it

3262
01:12:11,689 --> 01:12:11,699
it was cold but the ocean even if it
 

3263
01:12:11,699 --> 01:12:13,130
it was cold but the ocean even if it
looks kind of like how did you get back

3264
01:12:13,130 --> 01:12:13,140
looks kind of like how did you get back
 

3265
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:15,530
looks kind of like how did you get back
how did you swim back yeah uh well I

3266
01:12:15,530 --> 01:12:15,540
how did you swim back yeah uh well I
 

3267
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:16,729
how did you swim back yeah uh well I
didn't know you guys already answered

3268
01:12:16,729 --> 01:12:16,739
didn't know you guys already answered
 

3269
01:12:16,739 --> 01:12:18,370
didn't know you guys already answered
right yeah

3270
01:12:18,370 --> 01:12:18,380
right yeah
 

3271
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:21,290
right yeah
well I didn't know uh I didn't know this

3272
01:12:21,290 --> 01:12:21,300
well I didn't know uh I didn't know this
 

3273
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:22,370
well I didn't know uh I didn't know this
at the time but you're supposed to swim

3274
01:12:22,370 --> 01:12:22,380
at the time but you're supposed to swim
 

3275
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:24,410
at the time but you're supposed to swim
diagonally to the current but because

3276
01:12:24,410 --> 01:12:24,420
diagonally to the current but because
 

3277
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:26,090
diagonally to the current but because
like of the wind or the waves that day

3278
01:12:26,090 --> 01:12:26,100
like of the wind or the waves that day
 

3279
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:27,830
like of the wind or the waves that day
we'd actually drifted diagonally anyway

3280
01:12:27,830 --> 01:12:27,840
we'd actually drifted diagonally anyway
 

3281
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:30,290
we'd actually drifted diagonally anyway
so we were like Sideways from the people

3282
01:12:30,290 --> 01:12:30,300
so we were like Sideways from the people
 

3283
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:32,090
so we were like Sideways from the people
on the beach like where our people were

3284
01:12:32,090 --> 01:12:32,100
on the beach like where our people were
 

3285
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:34,430
on the beach like where our people were
so we had to actually swim diagonal and

3286
01:12:34,430 --> 01:12:34,440
so we had to actually swim diagonal and
 

3287
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:35,570
so we had to actually swim diagonal and
that I think that really helped us

3288
01:12:35,570 --> 01:12:35,580
that I think that really helped us
 

3289
01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:37,550
that I think that really helped us
unintentionally it was windy so there

3290
01:12:37,550 --> 01:12:37,560
unintentionally it was windy so there
 

3291
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:39,169
unintentionally it was windy so there
would it would have been choppy I mean

3292
01:12:39,169 --> 01:12:39,179
would it would have been choppy I mean
 

3293
01:12:39,179 --> 01:12:41,209
would it would have been choppy I mean
that I mean the water has a current and

3294
01:12:41,209 --> 01:12:41,219
that I mean the water has a current and
 

3295
01:12:41,219 --> 01:12:43,310
that I mean the water has a current and

you try out then
because

4102
01:29:51,169 --> 01:29:51,179
because
 

4103
01:29:51,179 --> 01:29:53,649
because
I wasn't so sure at that point

4104
01:29:53,649 --> 01:29:53,659
I wasn't so sure at that point
 

4105
01:29:53,659 --> 01:29:57,950
I wasn't so sure at that point
and I also thought that even though I

4106
01:29:57,950 --> 01:29:57,960
and I also thought that even though I
 

4107
01:29:57,960 --> 01:30:00,470

don't like them that's that's exactly

4108
01:30:00,470 --> 01:30:00,480
don't like them that's that's exactly

why I can improve them
 

4111
01:30:04,159 --> 01:30:06,470
why I can improve them
because I see it from a different point

4112
01:30:06,470 --> 01:30:06,480
because I see it from a different point
 

4113
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:07,450
because I see it from a different point
of view

4114
01:30:07,450 --> 01:30:07,460
