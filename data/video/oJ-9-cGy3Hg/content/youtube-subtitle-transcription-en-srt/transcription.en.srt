00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,509
one thing I
noticed um unlike cuz you know this is a

246
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:35,519
noticed um unlike cuz you know this is a
 

247
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,949
noticed um unlike cuz you know this is a
fan-made model so I can't use it in the

00:11:37,949 --> 00:11:37,959
fan-made model so I can't use it in the
 

249
00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:40,550
fan-made model so I can't use it in the
Holo app and I noticed one

250
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:40,560
Holo app and I noticed one
 

251
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,069
Holo app and I noticed one
thing in the Holo app when I like jump

252
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:44,079
thing in the Holo app when I like jump
 

253
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,150

and so on I think when it's not like
 

255
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,990
and so on I think when it's not like
when it's live the motion capture when

01:19:59,590 --> 01:19:59,600
probably only special uh occasion so we
 

1961
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:03,350
probably only special uh occasion so we
got to space it out a little bit Yeah

1962
01:20:03,350 --> 01:20:03,360
got to space it out a little bit Yeah
 

1963
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:06,229
got to space it out a little bit Yeah
spacing it out as long as we space it

1964
01:20:06,229 --> 01:20:06,239
spacing it out as long as we space it
 

1965
01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:09,870
spacing it out as long as we space it
out it's all good a 3D off collab like

1966
01:20:09,870 --> 01:20:09,880
out it's all good a 3D off collab like
 

1967
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:12,709
out it's all good a 3D off collab like
this well but I'm I'm I think so far I'm

we could put them together but it it
 

1981
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:28,510
we could put them together but it it
wouldn't be like we wouldn't be able to

01:20:28,510 --> 01:20:28,520
wouldn't be like we wouldn't be able to
 

1983
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:30,149
wouldn't be like we wouldn't be able to

actual like uh interaction uh possible
 

1993
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:44,709

and it wouldn't seem like we're in the
