04:36:14,629 --> 04:36:14,639
there something we could talk
 

8697
04:36:14,639 --> 04:36:17,949
there something we could talk
about I actually have a

8698
04:36:17,949 --> 04:36:17,959
about I actually have a
 

8699
04:36:17,959 --> 04:36:21,269
about I actually have a
topic

8700
04:36:21,269 --> 04:36:21,279

 

8701
04:36:21,279 --> 04:36:23,789

that let's try if

8702
04:36:23,789 --> 04:36:23,799
that let's try if
 

8703
04:36:23,799 --> 04:36:26,510
that let's try if
I should talk about it I want to talk

8704
04:36:26,510 --> 04:36:26,520
I should talk about it I want to talk
 

8705
04:36:26,520 --> 04:36:31,629
I should talk about it I want to talk
about it

8706
04:36:31,629 --> 04:36:31,639

 

8707
04:36:31,639 --> 04:36:34,070

though

8708
04:36:34,070 --> 04:36:34,080
though
 

8709
04:36:34,080 --> 04:36:41,350
though
oh

8710
04:36:41,350 --> 04:36:41,360

 

8711
04:36:41,360 --> 04:36:53,349

[Music]

8712
04:36:53,349 --> 04:36:53,359

 

8713
04:36:53,359 --> 04:36:56,830

um I'll just I'll just just stop me when

8714
04:36:56,830 --> 04:36:56,840
um I'll just I'll just just stop me when
 

8715
04:36:56,840 --> 04:36:58,470
um I'll just I'll just just stop me when
I get to

8716
04:36:58,470 --> 04:36:58,480
I get to
 

8717
04:36:58,480 --> 04:37:03,990
I get to
deep I don't want to go too

8718
04:37:03,990 --> 04:37:04,000

 

8719
04:37:04,000 --> 04:37:09,750

deep

8720
04:37:09,750 --> 04:37:09,760

 

8721
04:37:09,760 --> 04:37:11,629

okay

8722
04:37:11,629 --> 04:37:11,639
okay
 

8723
04:37:11,639 --> 04:37:16,750
okay
so it's probably going to get clipped

8724
04:37:16,750 --> 04:37:16,760
so it's probably going to get clipped
 

8725
04:37:16,760 --> 04:37:20,470
so it's probably going to get clipped
but uh yesterday I was just like going

8726
04:37:20,470 --> 04:37:20,480
but uh yesterday I was just like going
 

8727
04:37:20,480 --> 04:37:24,750
but uh yesterday I was just like going
through my channel looking at BS and

8728
04:37:24,750 --> 04:37:24,760
through my channel looking at BS and
 

8729
04:37:24,760 --> 04:37:27,590
through my channel looking at BS and
stuff and and I went to my shorts and I

8730
04:37:27,590 --> 04:37:27,600
stuff and and I went to my shorts and I
 

8731
04:37:27,600 --> 04:37:30,709
stuff and and I went to my shorts and I
saw um you know generally the shorts

8732
04:37:30,709 --> 04:37:30,719
saw um you know generally the shorts
 

8733
04:37:30,719 --> 04:37:33,150
saw um you know generally the shorts
that I uploaded on my break uh the

8734
04:37:33,150 --> 04:37:33,160
that I uploaded on my break uh the
 

8735
04:37:33,160 --> 04:37:35,990
that I uploaded on my break uh the
algorithm wasn't too nice to them

8736
04:37:35,990 --> 04:37:36,000
algorithm wasn't too nice to them
 

8737
04:37:36,000 --> 04:37:38,470
algorithm wasn't too nice to them
but that's okay the most latest one

8738
04:37:38,470 --> 04:37:38,480
but that's okay the most latest one
 

8739
04:37:38,480 --> 04:37:40,510
but that's okay the most latest one
however has

8740
04:37:40,510 --> 04:37:40,520
however has
 

8741
04:37:40,520 --> 04:37:42,470
however has
280,000

8742
04:37:42,470 --> 04:37:42,480
280,000
 

8743
04:37:42,480 --> 04:37:45,029
280,000
views the one with the gotcha and I was

8744
04:37:45,029 --> 04:37:45,039
views the one with the gotcha and I was
 

8745
04:37:45,039 --> 04:37:49,349
views the one with the gotcha and I was
like H I wonder why that one I guess the

8746
04:37:49,349 --> 04:37:49,359
like H I wonder why that one I guess the
 

8747
04:37:49,359 --> 04:37:51,230
like H I wonder why that one I guess the
algorithm just randomly blessed and I

8748
04:37:51,230 --> 04:37:51,240
algorithm just randomly blessed and I
 

8749
04:37:51,240 --> 04:37:52,869
algorithm just randomly blessed and I
think that's it

8750
04:37:52,869 --> 04:37:52,879
think that's it
 

8751
04:37:52,879 --> 04:37:55,470
think that's it
really um and I guess also like the

8752
04:37:55,470 --> 04:37:55,480
really um and I guess also like the
 

8753
04:37:55,480 --> 04:37:57,590
really um and I guess also like the
important thing with shorts is

8754
04:37:57,590 --> 04:37:57,600
important thing with shorts is
 

8755
04:37:57,600 --> 04:38:00,269
important thing with shorts is
that you can't choose the thumbnails

8756
04:38:00,269 --> 04:38:00,279
that you can't choose the thumbnails
 

8757
04:38:00,279 --> 04:38:03,109
that you can't choose the thumbnails
still they still haven't implemented you

8758
04:38:03,109 --> 04:38:03,119
still they still haven't implemented you
 

8759
04:38:03,119 --> 04:38:05,349
still they still haven't implemented you
know the ability to choose thumbnails so

8760
04:38:05,349 --> 04:38:05,359
know the ability to choose thumbnails so
 

8761
04:38:05,359 --> 04:38:07,189
know the ability to choose thumbnails so
right now you just got to get lucky or

8762
04:38:07,189 --> 04:38:07,199
right now you just got to get lucky or
 

8763
04:38:07,199 --> 04:38:08,910
right now you just got to get lucky or
you you can kind of plan it out I guess

8764
04:38:08,910 --> 04:38:08,920
you you can kind of plan it out I guess
 

8765
04:38:08,920 --> 04:38:13,230
you you can kind of plan it out I guess
if you know at what time of the 60

8766
04:38:13,230 --> 04:38:13,240
if you know at what time of the 60
 

8767
04:38:13,240 --> 04:38:15,590
if you know at what time of the 60
seconds the fil gets

8768
04:38:15,590 --> 04:38:15,600
seconds the fil gets
 

8769
04:38:15,600 --> 04:38:20,470
seconds the fil gets
chosen yeah mysterious but

8770
04:38:20,470 --> 04:38:20,480
chosen yeah mysterious but
 

8771
04:38:20,480 --> 04:38:23,709
chosen yeah mysterious but
um where are the

8772
04:38:23,709 --> 04:38:23,719
um where are the
 

8773
04:38:23,719 --> 04:38:26,310
um where are the
mushrooms uh that one kind of did really

8774
04:38:26,310 --> 04:38:26,320
mushrooms uh that one kind of did really
 

8775
04:38:26,320 --> 04:38:30,070
mushrooms uh that one kind of did really
well and uh I'm I'm happy about that but

8776
04:38:30,070 --> 04:38:30,080
well and uh I'm I'm happy about that but
 

8777
04:38:30,080 --> 04:38:32,029
well and uh I'm I'm happy about that but
I was wondering H I wonder if cuz I

8778
04:38:32,029 --> 04:38:32,039
I was wondering H I wonder if cuz I
 

8779
04:38:32,039 --> 04:38:34,029
I was wondering H I wonder if cuz I
didn't pay attention the past two weeks

8780
04:38:34,029 --> 04:38:34,039
didn't pay attention the past two weeks
 

8781
04:38:34,039 --> 04:38:36,109
didn't pay attention the past two weeks
if like

8782
04:38:36,109 --> 04:38:36,119
if like
 

8783
04:38:36,119 --> 04:38:38,709
if like
um any any video was doing better than

8784
04:38:38,709 --> 04:38:38,719
um any any video was doing better than
 

8785
04:38:38,719 --> 04:38:41,510
um any any video was doing better than
the others I didn't know if this was

8786
04:38:41,510 --> 04:38:41,520
the others I didn't know if this was
 

8787
04:38:41,520 --> 04:38:44,990
the others I didn't know if this was
like a a recent spurt in views or if it

8788
04:38:44,990 --> 04:38:45,000
like a a recent spurt in views or if it
 

8789
04:38:45,000 --> 04:38:49,990
like a a recent spurt in views or if it
was a constant achievement over time so

8790
04:38:49,990 --> 04:38:50,000
was a constant achievement over time so
 

8791
04:38:50,000 --> 04:38:53,029
was a constant achievement over time so
I wanted to see so check the comments to

8792
04:38:53,029 --> 04:38:53,039
I wanted to see so check the comments to
 

8793
04:38:53,039 --> 04:38:55,070
I wanted to see so check the comments to
get any hints if all the comments are

8794
04:38:55,070 --> 04:38:55,080
get any hints if all the comments are
 

8795
04:38:55,080 --> 04:38:57,150
get any hints if all the comments are
recent or something but no the comments

8796
04:38:57,150 --> 04:38:57,160
recent or something but no the comments
 

8797
04:38:57,160 --> 04:38:59,670
recent or something but no the comments
were like all like scattered over the

8798
04:38:59,670 --> 04:38:59,680
were like all like scattered over the
 

8799
04:38:59,680 --> 04:39:02,189
were like all like scattered over the
past two weeks and then I noticed when

8800
04:39:02,189 --> 04:39:02,199
past two weeks and then I noticed when
 

8801
04:39:02,199 --> 04:39:05,269
past two weeks and then I noticed when
I'm scrolling for the comments there's a

8802
04:39:05,269 --> 04:39:05,279
I'm scrolling for the comments there's a
 

8803
04:39:05,279 --> 04:39:09,470
I'm scrolling for the comments there's a
lot a lot of comments who are in a

8804
04:39:09,470 --> 04:39:09,480
lot a lot of comments who are in a
 

8805
04:39:09,480 --> 04:39:13,470
lot a lot of comments who are in a
weirdly aggressive and unnecessarily

8806
04:39:13,470 --> 04:39:13,480
weirdly aggressive and unnecessarily
 

8807
04:39:13,480 --> 04:39:14,830
weirdly aggressive and unnecessarily
obsessive

8808
04:39:14,830 --> 04:39:14,840
obsessive
 

8809
04:39:14,840 --> 04:39:19,789
obsessive
way uh complaining about the

8810
04:39:19,789 --> 04:39:19,799

 

8811
04:39:19,799 --> 04:39:23,269

censorship I just want to quote so you

8812
04:39:23,269 --> 04:39:23,279
censorship I just want to quote so you
 

8813
04:39:23,279 --> 04:39:26,029
censorship I just want to quote so you
understand how unnecessarily obsessed

8814
04:39:26,029 --> 04:39:26,039
understand how unnecessarily obsessed
 

8815
04:39:26,039 --> 04:39:29,189
understand how unnecessarily obsessed
these people are with the censorship I

8816
04:39:29,189 --> 04:39:29,199
these people are with the censorship I
 

8817
04:39:29,199 --> 04:39:31,349
these people are with the censorship I
quote this is the first time I've ever

8818
04:39:31,349 --> 04:39:31,359
quote this is the first time I've ever
 

8819
04:39:31,359 --> 04:39:33,470
quote this is the first time I've ever
seen a video blurring hats that just

8820
04:39:33,470 --> 04:39:33,480
seen a video blurring hats that just
 

8821
04:39:33,480 --> 04:39:35,830
seen a video blurring hats that just
seems so unnecessary and

8822
04:39:35,830 --> 04:39:35,840
seems so unnecessary and
 

8823
04:39:35,840 --> 04:39:38,910
seems so unnecessary and
silly why even blur the hands very

8824
04:39:38,910 --> 04:39:38,920
silly why even blur the hands very
 

8825
04:39:38,920 --> 04:39:41,110
silly why even blur the hands very
unnecessary why censor your hand

8826
04:39:41,110 --> 04:39:41,120
unnecessary why censor your hand
 

8827
04:39:41,120 --> 04:39:43,070
unnecessary why censor your hand
everyone knows you're white and everyone

8828
04:39:43,070 --> 04:39:43,080
everyone knows you're white and everyone
 

8829
04:39:43,080 --> 04:39:45,350
everyone knows you're white and everyone
has white what does that even

8830
04:39:45,350 --> 04:39:45,360
has white what does that even
 

8831
04:39:45,360 --> 04:39:47,868
has white what does that even
mean so there were like a lot of these

8832
04:39:47,868 --> 04:39:47,878
mean so there were like a lot of these
 

8833
04:39:47,878 --> 04:39:48,948
mean so there were like a lot of these
kind of

8834
04:39:48,948 --> 04:39:48,958
kind of
 

8835
04:39:48,958 --> 04:39:52,750
kind of
comments and they seem like people who

8836
04:39:52,750 --> 04:39:52,760
comments and they seem like people who
 

8837
04:39:52,760 --> 04:39:55,470
comments and they seem like people who
don't watch my streams a lot uh but that

8838
04:39:55,470 --> 04:39:55,480
don't watch my streams a lot uh but that
 

8839
04:39:55,480 --> 04:39:56,830
don't watch my streams a lot uh but that
doesn't matter I think they watch

8840
04:39:56,830 --> 04:39:56,840
doesn't matter I think they watch
 

8841
04:39:56,840 --> 04:39:59,510
doesn't matter I think they watch
YouTubers probably every now and then I

8842
04:39:59,510 --> 04:39:59,520
YouTubers probably every now and then I
 

8843
04:39:59,520 --> 04:40:02,150
YouTubers probably every now and then I
would think or they really just found

8844
04:40:02,150 --> 04:40:02,160
would think or they really just found
 

8845
04:40:02,160 --> 04:40:06,430
would think or they really just found
the the um short random

8846
04:40:06,430 --> 04:40:06,440
the the um short random
 

8847
04:40:06,440 --> 04:40:09,750
the the um short random
but um I think generally even when it's

8848
04:40:09,750 --> 04:40:09,760
but um I think generally even when it's
 

8849
04:40:09,760 --> 04:40:13,390
but um I think generally even when it's
not in an aggressive way uh

8850
04:40:13,390 --> 04:40:13,400
not in an aggressive way uh
 

8851
04:40:13,400 --> 04:40:16,470
not in an aggressive way uh
because I I get it I partially totally

8852
04:40:16,470 --> 04:40:16,480
because I I get it I partially totally
 

8853
04:40:16,480 --> 04:40:18,270
because I I get it I partially totally
get it I get both

8854
04:40:18,270 --> 04:40:18,280
get it I get both
 

8855
04:40:18,280 --> 04:40:20,190
get it I get both
sides

8856
04:40:20,190 --> 04:40:20,200
sides
 

8857
04:40:20,200 --> 04:40:23,390
sides
um like the reasoning of why why are we

8858
04:40:23,390 --> 04:40:23,400
um like the reasoning of why why are we
 

8859
04:40:23,400 --> 04:40:26,510
um like the reasoning of why why are we
doing this so generally I want to make

explanation of what you could consider
and what makes it maybe more

8908
04:41:34,070 --> 04:41:34,080
and what makes it maybe more
 

8909
04:41:34,080 --> 04:41:35,190
and what makes it maybe more
understandable

8910
04:41:35,190 --> 04:41:35,200
understandable
 

8911
04:41:35,200 --> 04:41:37,830
understandable
of why we

8912
04:41:37,830 --> 04:41:37,840
of why we
 

8913
04:41:37,840 --> 04:41:43,190
of why we
uh don't show our hands or so um imagine

8914
04:41:43,190 --> 04:41:43,200
uh don't show our hands or so um imagine
 

8915
04:41:43,200 --> 04:41:44,150
uh don't show our hands or so um imagine
let's

8916
04:41:44,150 --> 04:41:44,160
let's
 

8917
04:41:44,160 --> 04:41:49,110
let's
say yeah I'm I'm white I'm white so it's

8918
04:41:49,110 --> 04:41:49,120
say yeah I'm I'm white I'm white so it's
 

8919
04:41:49,120 --> 04:41:51,948
say yeah I'm I'm white I'm white so it's
not a big surprise that I'm white we all

8920
04:41:51,948 --> 04:41:51,958
not a big surprise that I'm white we all
 

8921
04:41:51,958 --> 04:41:56,470
not a big surprise that I'm white we all
know I'm white but let's imagine someone

8922
04:41:56,470 --> 04:41:56,480
know I'm white but let's imagine someone
 

8923
04:41:56,480 --> 04:41:58,190
know I'm white but let's imagine someone
maybe doesn't have a skin tone that

8924
04:41:58,190 --> 04:41:58,200
maybe doesn't have a skin tone that
 

8925
04:41:58,200 --> 04:42:00,750
maybe doesn't have a skin tone that
matches too well with their Avatar and

8926
04:42:00,750 --> 04:42:00,760
matches too well with their Avatar and
 

8927
04:42:00,760 --> 04:42:03,628
matches too well with their Avatar and
let's say showing using gloves wasn't so

8928
04:42:03,628 --> 04:42:03,638
let's say showing using gloves wasn't so
 

8929
04:42:03,638 --> 04:42:06,430
let's say showing using gloves wasn't so
normal here whole life let's say it

8930
04:42:06,430 --> 04:42:06,440
normal here whole life let's say it
 

8931
04:42:06,440 --> 04:42:09,270
normal here whole life let's say it
would become more and more uh expected

8932
04:42:09,270 --> 04:42:09,280
would become more and more uh expected
 

8933
04:42:09,280 --> 04:42:12,390
would become more and more uh expected
to show your hands and then maybe that

8934
04:42:12,390 --> 04:42:12,400
to show your hands and then maybe that
 

8935
04:42:12,400 --> 04:42:14,590
to show your hands and then maybe that
maybe one person who doesn't have that

8936
04:42:14,590 --> 04:42:14,600
maybe one person who doesn't have that
 

8937
04:42:14,600 --> 04:42:17,510
maybe one person who doesn't have that
skin tone would be pressured and

8938
04:42:17,510 --> 04:42:17,520
skin tone would be pressured and
 

8939
04:42:17,520 --> 04:42:20,788
skin tone would be pressured and
wouldn't be able to show it that the way

8940
04:42:20,788 --> 04:42:20,798
wouldn't be able to show it that the way
 

8941
04:42:20,798 --> 04:42:23,150
wouldn't be able to show it that the way
that others would do and then you kind

8942
04:42:23,150 --> 04:42:23,160
that others would do and then you kind
 

8943
04:42:23,160 --> 04:42:25,510
that others would do and then you kind
of put in a different in a difficult

8944
04:42:25,510 --> 04:42:25,520
of put in a different in a difficult
 

8945
04:42:25,520 --> 04:42:27,868
of put in a different in a difficult
situation yeah for me it doesn't matter

8946
04:42:27,868 --> 04:42:27,878
situation yeah for me it doesn't matter
 

8947
04:42:27,878 --> 04:42:31,350
situation yeah for me it doesn't matter
I guess cuz pretty matching but for

8948
04:42:31,350 --> 04:42:31,360
I guess cuz pretty matching but for
 

8949
04:42:31,360 --> 04:42:34,830
I guess cuz pretty matching but for
others it might not be so matching and

8950
04:42:34,830 --> 04:42:34,840
others it might not be so matching and
 

8951
04:42:34,840 --> 04:42:37,150
others it might not be so matching and
uh of course it also has to do with like

8952
04:42:37,150 --> 04:42:37,160
uh of course it also has to do with like
 

8953
04:42:37,160 --> 04:42:41,910
uh of course it also has to do with like
safety uh I it may sound crazy but there

8954
04:42:41,910 --> 04:42:41,920
safety uh I it may sound crazy but there
 

8955
04:42:41,920 --> 04:42:44,830
safety uh I it may sound crazy but there
are a lot of really obsessed people out

8956
04:42:44,830 --> 04:42:44,840
are a lot of really obsessed people out
 

8957
04:42:44,840 --> 04:42:48,390
are a lot of really obsessed people out
there who will look at the hands and try

8958
04:42:48,390 --> 04:42:48,400
there who will look at the hands and try
 

8959
04:42:48,400 --> 04:42:51,430
there who will look at the hands and try
to like count moles or

8960
04:42:51,430 --> 04:42:51,440
to like count moles or
 

8961
04:42:51,440 --> 04:42:55,708
to like count moles or
whatever uh people go overboard you know

8962
04:42:55,708 --> 04:42:55,718
whatever uh people go overboard you know
 

8963
04:42:55,718 --> 04:42:59,788
whatever uh people go overboard you know
uh so it is a thing it has to do with

8964
04:42:59,788 --> 04:42:59,798
uh so it is a thing it has to do with
 

8965
04:42:59,798 --> 04:43:01,990
uh so it is a thing it has to do with
safety too

8966
04:43:01,990 --> 04:43:02,000
safety too
 

8967
04:43:02,000 --> 04:43:08,750
safety too
um and yeah so that's some reasons and

8968
04:43:08,750 --> 04:43:08,760
um and yeah so that's some reasons and
 

8969
04:43:08,760 --> 04:43:12,350
um and yeah so that's some reasons and
then actually I guess people perceive it

8970
04:43:12,350 --> 04:43:12,360

9019
04:44:22,160 --> 04:44:24,430
as well it was also both of us and I U
my code my own hand was visible and my

9020

my code my own hand was visible and my
 

9021
04:44:24,440 --> 04:44:26,670
my code my own hand was visible and my
code was visible and I was trying to get

9022
04:44:26,670 --> 04:44:26,680
code was visible and I was trying to get
 

9023
04:44:26,680 --> 04:44:31,190
code was visible and I was trying to get
that sensor too because codes definitely

9024
04:44:31,190 --> 04:44:31,200
that sensor too because codes definitely
 

9025
04:44:31,200 --> 04:44:32,708
that sensor too because codes definitely
are

9026
04:44:32,708 --> 04:44:32,718
are
 

9027
04:44:32,718 --> 04:44:36,430
