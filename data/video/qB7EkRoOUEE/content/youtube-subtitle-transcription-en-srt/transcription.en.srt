than so you can make it like off to the
 

2685
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:53,990
than so you can make it like off to the
side a little bit CU like right here

2686
01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:54,000
side a little bit CU like right here
 

2687
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,950
side a little bit CU like right here
probably maybe From Below
