to be honest I mean I guess I could try
 

479
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,529
to be honest I mean I guess I could try
using my mobile hotspot but I'm pretty

480
00:18:21,529 --> 00:18:21,539
using my mobile hotspot but I'm pretty
 

481
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:23,690
using my mobile hotspot but I'm pretty
sure it's also [\h__\h] it might be better

482
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:23,700
sure it's also [\h__\h] it might be better
 

483
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:29,029
sure it's also [\h__\h] it might be better
