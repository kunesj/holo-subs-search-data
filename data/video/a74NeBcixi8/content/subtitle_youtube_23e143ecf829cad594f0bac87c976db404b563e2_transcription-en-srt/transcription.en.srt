there might be something extra but I
don't really know what kind of program

4702
01:59:56,430 --> 01:59:56,440
don't really know what kind of program
 

4703
01:59:56,440 --> 02:00:00,510
don't really know what kind of program
are you running here oh my head is

4704
02:00:00,510 --> 02:00:00,520
are you running here oh my head is
 

4705
02:00:00,520 --> 02:00:03,709

4707
02:00:03,719 --> 02:00:05,870
spinning I think I don't know how though
because like here is an arrow as well

4708
02:00:05,870 --> 02:00:05,880
because like here is an arrow as well
 

4709
02:00:05,880 --> 02:00:07,629
because like here is an arrow as well
but that Arrow automatically goes up

4710
02:00:07,629 --> 02:00:07,639
but that Arrow automatically goes up
 

4711
02:00:07,639 --> 02:00:11,109
but that Arrow automatically goes up
there so I don't know like I don't think

our brain power okay so we want him to

5208
02:11:54,990 --> 02:11:55,000
our brain power okay so we want him to
 

5209
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:58,430
our brain power okay so we want him to
go here in the middle so he starts uh in

5210
02:11:58,430 --> 02:11:58,440
go here in the middle so he starts uh in
 

5211
02:11:58,440 --> 02:12:00,950
go here in the middle so he starts uh in
the middle this has to happen this has

5212
02:12:00,950 --> 02:12:00,960
the middle this has to happen this has
 

5213
02:12:00,960 --> 02:12:05,589
the middle this has to happen this has
to go here um and then he goes like this

5214
02:12:05,589 --> 02:12:05,599
to go here um and then he goes like this
 

5215
02:12:05,599 --> 02:12:07,669
to go here um and then he goes like this
like this like this like this like this

5216
02:12:07,669 --> 02:12:07,679
like this like this like this like this
 

5217

was good this was all perfect the only
 

5219
02:12:10,760 --> 02:12:16,069
was good this was all perfect the only
problem is I don't know how he can go

5220
02:12:16,069 --> 02:12:16,079

 

5221
02:12:16,079 --> 02:12:18,229

here if wait which way do you do you

5222
02:12:18,229 --> 02:12:18,239
here if wait which way do you do you
 

5223
02:12:18,239 --> 02:12:20,069
here if wait which way do you do you
want him to go into this one or do you

5224
02:12:20,069 --> 02:12:20,079
want him to go into this one or do you
 

5225
02:12:20,079 --> 02:12:22,390
want him to go into this one or do you
want him to go where you no no no the

5226
02:12:22,390 --> 02:12:22,400
want him to go where you no no no the
 

5227

the one that does you want him to go in
 

5229
02:12:24,280 --> 02:12:26,870
the one that does you want him to go in
the middle still yeah okay but he also

5230
02:12:26,870 --> 02:12:26,880
the middle still yeah okay but he also
 

5231
02:12:26,880 --> 02:12:31,310
the middle still yeah okay but he also
should touch all the golden

5232
02:12:31,310 --> 02:12:31,320

 

5233
02:12:31,320 --> 02:12:37,310

ones oh I think it works like this no no

5234
02:12:37,310 --> 02:12:37,320
ones oh I think it works like this no no
 

5235
02:12:37,320 --> 02:12:40,109
ones oh I think it works like this no no
no I mean Chad says it's possible but I

5236
02:12:40,109 --> 02:12:40,119
no I mean Chad says it's possible but I
 

5237
02:12:40,119 --> 02:12:41,709
no I mean Chad says it's possible but I
don't I don't see how it's possible

don't I don't see how it's possible
 

5239
02:12:41,719 --> 02:12:44,069
don't I don't see how it's possible
because I'm to hit all of them and also

5240
02:12:44,069 --> 02:12:44,079
because I'm to hit all of them and also
 

5241
02:12:44,079 --> 02:12:48,109
because I'm to hit all of them and also
go into the middle

5242
02:12:48,109 --> 02:12:48,119

 

5243
02:12:48,119 --> 02:12:50,669

yeah yeah cuz you can't do this I don't

5244
02:12:50,669 --> 02:12:50,679
yeah yeah cuz you can't do this I don't
 

5245

yeah yeah cuz you can't do this I don't
think it's it's I I think it's actually

5246
02:12:52,350 --> 02:12:52,360
think it's it's I I think it's actually
 

5247
02:12:52,360 --> 02:12:55,149
think it's it's I I think it's actually
impossible I think this is the wrong you

5248
02:12:55,149 --> 02:12:55,159
impossible I think this is the wrong you
 

5249
02:12:55,159 --> 02:12:59,030
impossible I think this is the wrong you
cannot change it while it's moving no I

5250
02:12:59,030 --> 02:12:59,040
cannot change it while it's moving no I
 

5251
02:12:59,040 --> 02:13:02,109
cannot change it while it's moving no I
yeah

5252
02:13:02,109 --> 02:13:02,119

 

5253
02:13:02,119 --> 02:13:04,549

um just does the ding thing for him cuz

5254
02:13:04,549 --> 02:13:04,559
um just does the ding thing for him cuz
 

5255
02:13:04,559 --> 02:13:07,830
um just does the ding thing for him cuz
he's special so he's supposed to go into

5256
02:13:07,830 --> 02:13:07,840
he's special so he's supposed to go into
 

5257
02:13:07,840 --> 02:13:10,350
he's special so he's supposed to go into
here and somebody goes into here and we

5258
02:13:10,350 --> 02:13:10,360
here and somebody goes into here and we
 

5259
02:13:10,360 --> 02:13:13,950
here and somebody goes into here and we
just have to figure out what it is that

5260
02:13:13,950 --> 02:13:13,960
just have to figure out what it is that
 

5261
02:13:13,960 --> 02:13:15,870
just have to figure out what it is that
both of us going into there

5262
02:13:15,870 --> 02:13:15,880
both of us going into there
 

5263
02:13:15,880 --> 02:13:17,830
both of us going into there
activates I hope it's not a thing where

5264
02:13:17,830 --> 02:13:17,840
activates I hope it's not a thing where
 

5265
02:13:17,840 --> 02:13:20,669
activates I hope it's not a thing where
you need more than three people no no

5266
02:13:20,669 --> 02:13:20,679
you need more than three people no no
 

5267
02:13:20,679 --> 02:13:22,870
you need more than three people no no
they said it's everything's doable with

5268
02:13:22,870 --> 02:13:22,880
they said it's everything's doable with
 

5269
02:13:22,880 --> 02:13:29,270
they said it's everything's doable with
just one person oh with one yeah okay so

5270
02:13:29,270 --> 02:13:29,280
just one person oh with one yeah okay so
 

5271
02:13:29,280 --> 02:13:30,350
just one person oh with one yeah okay so
actually I don't know how the puzzle

5272
02:13:30,350 --> 02:13:30,360
actually I don't know how the puzzle
 

5273
02:13:30,360 --> 02:13:31,709
actually I don't know how the puzzle
earlier would have been possible but I

5274
02:13:31,709 --> 02:13:31,719
earlier would have been possible but I
 

5275
02:13:31,719 --> 02:13:33,510
earlier would have been possible but I
doubt they would make it like okay I'm

5276
02:13:33,510 --> 02:13:33,520
doubt they would make it like okay I'm
 

5277
02:13:33,520 --> 02:13:35,990
doubt they would make it like okay I'm
going to reset it so that he goes into

5278
02:13:35,990 --> 02:13:36,000
going to reset it so that he goes into
 

5279
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:41,510
going to reset it so that he goes into
the far right one okay about that one

5280
02:13:41,510 --> 02:13:41,520

 

5281
02:13:41,520 --> 02:13:44,669

though oh wait what was it he goes this

5282
02:13:44,669 --> 02:13:44,679
though oh wait what was it he goes this
 

5283
02:13:44,679 --> 02:13:47,950
though oh wait what was it he goes this
way this is kind of easy who says this

5284
02:13:47,950 --> 02:13:47,960
way this is kind of easy who says this
 

5285
02:13:47,960 --> 02:13:48,830
way this is kind of easy who says this
is

5286
02:13:48,830 --> 02:13:48,840
is
 

5287
02:13:48,840 --> 02:13:51,229
is
easy they think it's easy cuz they don't

5288
02:13:51,229 --> 02:13:51,239
easy they think it's easy cuz they don't
 

5289
02:13:51,239 --> 02:13:52,549
easy they think it's easy cuz they don't
actually get

5290
02:13:52,549 --> 02:13:52,559
actually get
 

5291
02:13:52,559 --> 02:13:57,470
actually get
it are they fibbing they're fibbing uh

5292
02:13:57,470 --> 02:13:57,480
it are they fibbing they're fibbing uh
 

5293
02:13:57,480 --> 02:13:59,990
it are they fibbing they're fibbing uh

7221
03:02:10,319 --> 03:02:12,790

the water into like the open field that

7222
03:02:12,790 --> 03:02:12,800
the water into like the open field that
 

7223
03:02:12,800 --> 03:02:16,110
the water into like the open field that
was really cool I think the puzzle we

7224
03:02:16,110 --> 03:02:16,120

7225
03:02:16,120 --> 03:02:18,190
