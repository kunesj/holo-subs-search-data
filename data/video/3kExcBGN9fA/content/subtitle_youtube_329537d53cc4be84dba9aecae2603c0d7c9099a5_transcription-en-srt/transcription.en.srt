on it anymore but I just I didn't see it
that way I just thought when it was

1094
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:46,440
that way I just thought when it was
 

1095
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,230
that way I just thought when it was
combined because it was so small like a

1096
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:48,240
combined because it was so small like a
 

1097
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,830
combined because it was so small like a
tiny badge I just thought that was like

1098

tiny badge I just thought that was like
 

1099
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,389
tiny badge I just thought that was like
its own little design like cute bad just

1100
00:29:53,389 --> 00:29:53,399
its own little design like cute bad just
 

1101
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:56,549
its own little design like cute bad just
it's just a separate thing and I didn't

1102
00:29:56,549 --> 00:29:56,559
it's just a separate thing and I didn't
 

1103
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,630
it's just a separate thing and I didn't
see it as a hint that my Shield can

1104
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:58,640
see it as a hint that my Shield can
 

1105
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,669
see it as a hint that my Shield can
actually do that yeah but now it makes

1106
00:30:01,669 --> 00:30:01,679
actually do that yeah but now it makes
 

1107
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,509
actually do that yeah but now it makes
so much more sense because now I realize

1108
00:30:03,509 --> 00:30:03,519
so much more sense because now I realize
 

1109
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:06,830
so much more sense because now I realize
