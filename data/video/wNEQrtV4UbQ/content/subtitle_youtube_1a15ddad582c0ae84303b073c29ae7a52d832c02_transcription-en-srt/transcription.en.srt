2645
01:26:19,719 --> 01:26:25,350

wonder if anybody told her this before

2646
01:26:25,350 --> 01:26:25,360

 

2647
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:26,910

no one can hear me half of the time and

2648
01:26:26,910 --> 01:26:26,920
no one can hear me half of the time and
 

2649
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:29,830
no one can hear me half of the time and
it's so annoying really then there these

2650

it's so annoying really then there these
 

2651
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:31,470
it's so annoying really then there these
low talkers and then there's the kind of

2652
01:26:31,470 --> 01:26:31,480
low talkers and then there's the kind of
 

2653
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:33,790
low talkers and then there's the kind of
people who are just always screaming

2654
01:26:33,790 --> 01:26:33,800
people who are just always screaming
 

2655

right I think I have a more loud voice
 

2657
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:39,430
right I think I have a more loud voice
because I've

2658
01:26:39,430 --> 01:26:39,440
because I've
 

2659
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:43,189
because I've
been like kind of trained to speak and

a little pile of balls so I can always

a little pile of balls so I can always
grab them and then if I don't know if
