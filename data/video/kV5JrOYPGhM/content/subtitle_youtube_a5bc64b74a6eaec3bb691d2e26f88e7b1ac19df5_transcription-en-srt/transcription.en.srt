supposed to be muted who knows if i sit

208
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:45,600
supposed to be muted who knows if i sit
 

209
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,910
supposed to be muted who knows if i sit
on the egg maybe it will um hatch

210
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:47,920
on the egg maybe it will um hatch
 

211
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,230
on the egg maybe it will um hatch
eventually

212
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:50,240
eventually
 

213
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,110

growing limbs so i think it wants to get
 

219
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,110
growing limbs so i think it wants to get
out of its shell eventually maybe maybe

220
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:01,120
out of its shell eventually maybe maybe
 

221
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,630

we can activate

222
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:02,640
we can activate
 

223
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,750
we can activate
some hatching process by making it dance

224
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:05,760
some hatching process by making it dance
 

225
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,910
some hatching process by making it dance
yeah yeah yeah yeah oh god it's already

226
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:07,920
yeah yeah yeah yeah oh god it's already
 

227
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,949
yeah yeah yeah yeah oh god it's already
dancing oh yeah like warm it up

228
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:10,959
dancing oh yeah like warm it up
 

229
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,630
dancing oh yeah like warm it up
like you start to warm up your body and

230
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:12,640
like you start to warm up your body and
 

231
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,790
like you start to warm up your body and
that helps the egg hatch

232
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:14,800
that helps the egg hatch
 

233
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,670
that helps the egg hatch
yeah

234
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:15,680

3279
01:26:10,639 --> 01:26:12,950
ends something like this
a circle like that and then you put the

3280
01:26:12,950 --> 01:26:12,960
a circle like that and then you put the
 

3281
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:14,790
a circle like that and then you put the
pressure the weight on the other side

3282
01:26:14,790 --> 01:26:14,800
pressure the weight on the other side
 

3283
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:19,030

3289
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:30,470
and that's where we go basically
into the intro again

3290
