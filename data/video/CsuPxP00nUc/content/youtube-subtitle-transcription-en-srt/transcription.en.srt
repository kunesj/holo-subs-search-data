why I thought oh yeah okay this is the

174
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:46,199
why I thought oh yeah okay this is the
 

175
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,350

181
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,830
it I mean I understand the logic that
you know it recognizes the game on the

182
00:07:59,830 --> 00:07:59,840
you know it recognizes the game on the
 

183
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,790
you know it recognizes the game on the
PC so it just updates it even though I
