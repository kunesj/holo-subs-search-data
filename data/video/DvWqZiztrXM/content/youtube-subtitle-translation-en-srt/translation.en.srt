525
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,150
Then I saw Tiara grab another tissue and
try to give it to the lever,

526
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:35,160
try to give it to the lever,
 

527
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:39,909
try to give it to the lever,
but her little finger was fine.

528
00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:39,919

 

529
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,450

That's why she was going alone, but

530
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:45,409
That's why she was going alone, but
 

531
00:20:45,409 --> 00:20:45,419

 

532
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:50,409

even at the wrong place, she hit the tissue and it's

533
00:20:50,409 --> 00:20:50,419

 

534
00:20:50,419 --> 00:20:53,450

still an acorn.  I'm

535
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:53,460
still an acorn.  I'm
 

536
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:57,110
still an acorn.  I'm
used to going alone more than anywhere else, so I

537
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:57,120
used to going alone more than anywhere else, so I
 

538
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,789
used to going alone more than anywhere else, so I
don't want people to find out I'm crying alone,

539
00:20:58,789 --> 00:20:58,799
don't want people to find out I'm crying alone,
 

540
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,830
don't want people to find out I'm crying alone,
even though it's people I don't know.  I've

541
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:03,890
even though it's people I don't know.  I've
 

542
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:03,900

 

543
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,850

00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:09,650

 

546
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:09,660

 

547
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,370


548
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:10,380

 

549
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,450

lived my life in such a way that I can do anything about it even if I just get a little upset,

550
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:11,460
lived my life in such a way that I can do anything about it even if I just get a little upset,
 

551
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:14,630
lived my life in such a way that I can do anything about it even if I just get a little upset,
so I guess I've been trained to do that,

00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:19,029
so I guess I've been trained to do that,
 

553

might be better to reserve a bath for yourself, but I
wonder if we can do something about it.  I wonder

wonder if we can do something about it.  I wonder
 

1572

wonder if we can do something about it.  I wonder
if it's possible to do something like a store or something,

if it's possible to do something like a store or something,
 

1574

1591
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,750
if they're my first and second best friends, I
might be able to go there just in time.

went to the bath event, so I
 

1611
00:58:57,119 --> 00:59:00,589
went to the bath event, so I
kind of avoided the bath event.

1612
00:59:00,589 --> 00:59:00,599
kind of avoided the bath event.
 

1613
00:59:00,599 --> 00:59:04,490
kind of avoided the bath event.
If it was like taking separate baths, I wouldn't have done it at all.

I think it's good that we're separated, right? There's a time when we

I think it's good that we're separated, right? There's a time when we

So, is anyone else watching except Marin-senpai? I'll

1722
01:02:47,410 --> 01:02:47,420

 

1723
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:54,890

come in with you.  It's like,

1724
01:02:54,890 --> 01:02:54,900

 

1725
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:57,710

if it was a game, you'd just get stills, and

1726
01:02:57,710 --> 01:02:59,030
if it was a game, you'd just get stills, and
 

1727
01:02:59,030 --> 01:02:59,040

 

1728
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:01,910

then illustrations would come out.But then you take a bath after taking a sheep bath.That's

1729
01:03:01,910 --> 01:03:02,690
then illustrations would come out.But then you take a bath after taking a sheep bath.That's
 

1730
01:03:02,690 --> 01:03:02,700

 

1731
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:03,880

amazing.  There

1732
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:03,890
amazing.  There
 

1733
01:03:03,890 --> 01:03:05,150
amazing.  There

1734
01:03:05,150 --> 01:03:06,829

 

1735
01:03:06,829 --> 01:03:10,069

 

1736
01:03:10,069 --> 01:03:11,930

 

1737
01:03:11,930 --> 01:03:13,370

 

1738
01:03:13,370 --> 01:03:16,010

 

1739
01:03:16,010 --> 01:03:16,020

 

1740
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:17,690

was talk about how embarrassed I was about Suzu and how true it was during the broadcast.

1741
01:03:17,690 --> 01:03:17,700
was talk about how embarrassed I was about Suzu and how true it was during the broadcast.
 

1742
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:19,190
was talk about how embarrassed I was about Suzu and how true it was during the broadcast.
After it ended, I asked if it

1743
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:19,200
After it ended, I asked if it
 

1744
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,410
After it ended, I asked if it
was true

1745
01:03:20,410 --> 01:03:20,420
was true
 

1746
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:26,750
was true
and asked if I would be able to

1747
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:26,760

 

1748
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:31,010

enter. It's an age-

1749
01:03:31,010 --> 01:03:31,020

 

1750
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:35,329

restricted game and you

1751
01:03:35,329 --> 01:03:35,339

 

1752
01:03:35,339 --> 01:03:36,650

might not be able to see it in

1753
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:36,660
might not be able to see it in
 

1754
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:39,710
might not be able to see it in
other games.  But

1755
01:03:39,710 --> 01:03:39,720
other games.  But
 

1756
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:41,930
other games.  But
even though we said we'd go in together, aren't Japanese baths

1757
01:03:41,930 --> 01:03:41,940
even though we said we'd go in together, aren't Japanese baths
 

1758
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:46,490
even though we said we'd go in together, aren't Japanese baths
small? It

1759
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:46,500

 

1760
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:48,530

was ours, so Mel-chan

1761
01:03:48,530 --> 01:03:48,540
was ours, so Mel-chan
 

1762
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:51,650
was ours, so Mel-chan
went in first, and

1763
01:03:51,650 --> 01:03:51,660
went in first, and
 

1764
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:54,710
went in first, and
when Arai finished, her little finger went in, but

1765
01:03:54,710 --> 01:03:54,720
when Arai finished, her little finger went in, but
 

1766
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,329
when Arai finished, her little finger went in, but
just for a moment.

1767
01:03:56,329 --> 01:03:56,339
just for a moment.
 

1768
01:03:56,339 --> 01:03:58,010
just for a moment.
When I'm naked,

1769
01:03:58,010 --> 01:03:58,020
When I'm naked,
 

1770
01:03:58,020 --> 01:03:58,789
When I'm naked,
at the same time, I'm

1771
01:03:58,789 --> 01:03:58,799
at the same time, I'm
 

1772
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:01,430
at the same time, I'm
in the same room with my

1773
01:04:01,430 --> 01:04:01,440
in the same room with my
 

1774
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:04,630
in the same room with my
little finger, and while I'm being used, my pinky finger comes up and we

1775
01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:06,349
little finger, and while I'm being used, my pinky finger comes up and we
 

1776
01:04:06,349 --> 01:04:06,359

 

1777
01:04:06,359 --> 01:04:07,030

use it together. After all, I've

1778
01:04:07,030 --> 01:04:07,040
use it together. After all, I've
 

1779
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:14,270
use it together. After all, I've
seen it before, so I wonder

1780
01:04:14,270 --> 01:04:14,280

 

1781
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:17,390

if I'm not longing for it, but I

1782
01:04:17,390 --> 01:04:17,400
if I'm not longing for it, but I
 

1783
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:38,620
if I'm not longing for it, but I
can't go back.

1784
01:04:38,620 --> 01:04:38,630

 

1785

1842
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:07,460

because it was in the movie

Well, there must have been a school there, right? I
wonder if it

1861
01:06:38,809 --> 01:06:38,819
wonder if it
 

1862
01:06:38,819 --> 01:06:49,430
wonder if it
was the enemy's child.The school comes up quite a bit.Maybe I've

1863
01:06:49,430 --> 01:06:49,440

 

1864
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:52,970

1868
01:06:56,119 --> 01:07:00,049
n't know which one, but it
was there too.  I'm

1869

was there too.  I'm
 

1870
01:07:00,059 --> 01:07:01,609
was there too.  I'm
a little curious as to whether

1871
01:07:01,609 --> 01:07:01,619
a little curious as to whether
 

1872
01:07:01,619 --> 01:07:04,370
a little curious as to whether

1873
01:07:04,370 --> 01:07:04,380

 

1874
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:06,890
