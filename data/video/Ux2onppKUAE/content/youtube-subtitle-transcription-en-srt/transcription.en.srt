these aggressive teams play against each
 

2037
00:58:01,619 --> 00:58:04,490
these aggressive teams play against each
other so for us to first place if it

2038
00:58:04,490 --> 00:58:04,500
other so for us to first place if it
 

2039
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:05,870
other so for us to first place if it
were to happen

2040
00:58:05,870 --> 00:58:05,880
were to happen
 

2041
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,670
were to happen
um then

2042
00:58:07,670 --> 00:58:07,680
um then
 

2043
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:11,329
um then
what wait wait so if JP wins then we def

2044
00:58:11,329 --> 00:58:11,339
what wait wait so if JP wins then we def
 

2045
00:58:11,339 --> 00:58:12,770
what wait wait so if JP wins then we def
then JP definitely gets first place

2046
00:58:12,770 --> 00:58:12,780
then JP definitely gets first place
 

2047
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:13,849
then JP definitely gets first place
right

2048
00:58:13,849 --> 00:58:13,859
right
 

2049
00:58:13,859 --> 00:58:16,849
right
um so if ID wins then there might be a

2050
00:58:16,849 --> 00:58:16,859
um so if ID wins then there might be a
 

2051
00:58:16,859 --> 00:58:18,290
um so if ID wins then there might be a
chance depending on point difference it

2052
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:18,300
chance depending on point difference it
 

2053
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:20,510
chance depending on point difference it
might be but they could get like 800

2054
00:58:20,510 --> 00:58:20,520
might be but they could get like 800
 

2055
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:23,690
might be but they could get like 800
points yeah I don't know it could be a

2056
00:58:23,690 --> 00:58:23,700
points yeah I don't know it could be a
