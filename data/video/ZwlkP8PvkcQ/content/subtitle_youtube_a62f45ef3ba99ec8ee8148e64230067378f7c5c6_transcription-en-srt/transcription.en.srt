00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,350
town that took up quite a bit of my time
and thus we we weren't able to get that

280

the OG game as well and and it's just
like I guess with this kind of

9204
04:26:23,830 --> 04:26:23,840
like I guess with this kind of
 

9205
04:26:23,840 --> 04:26:27,790
like I guess with this kind of
angle there's not much you can do but uh

9206
04:26:27,790 --> 04:26:27,800
angle there's not much you can do but uh
 

9207
04:26:27,800 --> 04:26:31,429
angle there's not much you can do but uh
get used to the angle I guess

9208
04:26:31,429 --> 04:26:31,439
get used to the angle I guess
 

9209
04:26:31,439 --> 04:26:34,990
get used to the angle I guess
like optical illusions were tough on

9210
04:26:34,990 --> 04:26:35,000
like optical illusions were tough on
 

9211
04:26:35,000 --> 04:26:38,229
like optical illusions were tough on
me

9212
04:26:38,229 --> 04:26:38,239

M oh and I mean this seems to be an
issue that not many people have but the

9216
04:26:46,030 --> 04:26:46,040
issue that not many people have but the
 

9217
04:26:46,040 --> 04:26:48,429
issue that not many people have but the
timings were so difficult for me to

9218
04:26:48,429 --> 04:26:48,439
timings were so difficult for me to
 

9219
04:26:48,439 --> 04:26:51,910
timings were so difficult for me to
grasp a lot of the

9220
04:26:51,910 --> 04:26:51,920

 

9221
04:26:51,920 --> 04:26:55,349

time man you guys kept on roasting me I

9222
04:26:55,349 --> 04:26:55,359
time man you guys kept on roasting me I
 

9223

time man you guys kept on roasting me I
was so bad that people come in and think

9224
04:26:57,710 --> 04:26:57,720
was so bad that people come in and think
 

9225
04:26:57,720 --> 04:26:59,750
was so bad that people come in and think
that I'm like I don't even know about

9226
04:26:59,750 --> 04:26:59,760
that I'm like I don't even know about
 

9227
04:26:59,760 --> 04:27:01,429
that I'm like I don't even know about
the timings and I'm purposefully

9228
04:27:01,429 --> 04:27:01,439
the timings and I'm purposefully
 

9229
04:27:01,439 --> 04:27:04,710
the timings and I'm purposefully
ignoring them or so no I really

9230
04:27:04,710 --> 04:27:04,720
ignoring them or so no I really
 

9231
04:27:04,720 --> 04:27:07,830
ignoring them or so no I really
tried and I don't know I did not play

9232
04:27:07,830 --> 04:27:07,840
tried and I don't know I did not play
 

9233
04:27:07,840 --> 04:27:10,950
tried and I don't know I did not play
for OBS but I don't

9234
04:27:10,950 --> 04:27:10,960
for OBS but I don't
 

9235
04:27:10,960 --> 04:27:13,870
for OBS but I don't
know maybe we can blame the controller

9236
04:27:13,870 --> 04:27:13,880
know maybe we can blame the controller
 

9237
04:27:13,880 --> 04:27:16,070
know maybe we can blame the controller
maybe the delay or maybe it's just a

9238
04:27:16,070 --> 04:27:16,080
maybe the delay or maybe it's just a
 

9239
04:27:16,080 --> 04:27:21,030
maybe the delay or maybe it's just a
skill issue um but it didn't

9240
04:27:21,030 --> 04:27:21,040
skill issue um but it didn't
 

9241
04:27:21,040 --> 04:27:25,309
skill issue um but it didn't
really make like the

9242
04:27:25,309 --> 04:27:25,319
really make like the
 

9243
04:27:25,319 --> 04:27:29,070
really make like the
whole process of battling that much

9244
04:27:29,070 --> 04:27:29,080
whole process of battling that much
 

9245
04:27:29,080 --> 04:27:32,030
whole process of battling that much
worse for me for me in

9246
04:27:32,030 --> 04:27:32,040
worse for me for me in
 

9247
04:27:32,040 --> 04:27:34,630
worse for me for me in
particular only for me personally I

9248
04:27:34,630 --> 04:27:34,640
particular only for me personally I
 

9249
04:27:34,640 --> 04:27:39,109
particular only for me personally I
didn't feel like it was was a big

9250
04:27:39,109 --> 04:27:39,119
didn't feel like it was was a big
 

9251
04:27:39,119 --> 04:27:41,670
didn't feel like it was was a big
problem uh because I feel like I still

9252
04:27:41,670 --> 04:27:41,680
problem uh because I feel like I still
 

9253
04:27:41,680 --> 04:27:44,030
problem uh because I feel like I still
did a lot of damage and it maybe it made

9254
04:27:44,030 --> 04:27:44,040
did a lot of damage and it maybe it made
 

9255
04:27:44,040 --> 04:27:45,670
did a lot of damage and it maybe it made
the fights more interesting that the

9256
04:27:45,670 --> 04:27:45,680
the fights more interesting that the
 

9257
04:27:45,680 --> 04:27:47,269
the fights more interesting that the
timings aren't too easy because if

9258
04:27:47,269 --> 04:27:47,279
timings aren't too easy because if
 

9259
04:27:47,279 --> 04:27:48,510
timings aren't too easy because if
they're too easy you can block

9260
04:27:48,510 --> 04:27:48,520
they're too easy you can block
 

9261
04:27:48,520 --> 04:27:51,469
they're too easy you can block
everything and you can do huge damage

9262
04:27:51,469 --> 04:27:51,479
everything and you can do huge damage
 

9263
04:27:51,479 --> 04:27:54,229
everything and you can do huge damage
and it's like too easy maybe you know I

9264
04:27:54,229 --> 04:27:54,239
and it's like too easy maybe you know I
 

9265
04:27:54,239 --> 04:27:56,109
and it's like too easy maybe you know I
don't know I feel like it was fine the

9266
04:27:56,109 --> 04:27:56,119
don't know I feel like it was fine the
 

9267
04:27:56,119 --> 04:27:58,590
don't know I feel like it was fine the
amount of uh timings that I got right

9268
04:27:58,590 --> 04:27:58,600
amount of uh timings that I got right
 

9269
04:27:58,600 --> 04:28:02,389
amount of uh timings that I got right
was I feel like kind of kind of balanced

9270
04:28:02,389 --> 04:28:02,399
was I feel like kind of kind of balanced
 

9271
04:28:02,399 --> 04:28:07,429
was I feel like kind of kind of balanced
out in a in a good way maybe

9272
04:28:07,429 --> 04:28:07,439
out in a in a good way maybe
 

9273
04:28:07,439 --> 04:28:11,109

9279
04:28:16,439 --> 04:28:18,469
know and I'm just generally not good
with timing things like that's why I

9280
04:28:18,469 --> 04:28:18,479
with timing things like that's why I
 

9281
04:28:18,479 --> 04:28:21,950
with timing things like that's why I
can't play Rhythm

9282
04:28:21,950 --> 04:28:21,960

04:28:21,960 --> 04:28:25,149

games some some like for example the the

9284
04:28:25,149 --> 04:28:25,159
games some some like for example the the
 

9285
04:28:25,159 --> 04:28:27,990

always got that right and Bowser attacks
 

9289
04:28:30,840 --> 04:28:32,910
always got that right and Bowser attacks
too there's certain attacks that were

9290
04:28:32,910 --> 04:28:32,920
too there's certain attacks that were
 

9291
04:28:32,920 --> 04:28:36,149
too there's certain attacks that were
just extremely unpredictable to me and

9292
04:28:36,149 --> 04:28:36,159
just extremely unpredictable to me and
 

9293
04:28:36,159 --> 04:28:38,910
just extremely unpredictable to me and
um hard to remember because especially

9294
04:28:38,910 --> 04:28:38,920
um hard to remember because especially
 

9295
04:28:38,920 --> 04:28:40,389
um hard to remember because especially
even when you get it right the

9296
04:28:40,389 --> 04:28:40,399
even when you get it right the
 

9297
04:28:40,399 --> 04:28:42,670
even when you get it right the
exclamation mark

9298
04:28:42,670 --> 04:28:42,680
exclamation mark
 

9299
04:28:42,680 --> 04:28:45,710
exclamation mark
disappears and then you then I forget it

9300
04:28:45,710 --> 04:28:45,720
disappears and then you then I forget it
 

9301
04:28:45,720 --> 04:28:47,950
disappears and then you then I forget it

that point one more criticism I I don't
 

9349
04:29:50,880 --> 04:29:54,070
that point one more criticism I I don't
think I really liked the way the stats

9350
04:29:54,070 --> 04:29:54,080
think I really liked the way the stats
 

9351
04:29:54,080 --> 04:29:57,389
think I really liked the way the stats
worked like how they would more or less

9352
04:29:57,389 --> 04:29:57,399
worked like how they would more or less
 

9353
04:29:57,399 --> 04:30:00,070
worked like how they would more or less
force you to go for certain stats

9354
04:30:00,070 --> 04:30:00,080
force you to go for certain stats
 

9355
04:30:00,080 --> 04:30:01,870
force you to go for certain stats
because they're buffed so you should go

9356
04:30:01,870 --> 04:30:01,880
because they're buffed so you should go
 

9357
04:30:01,880 --> 04:30:04,349
because they're buffed so you should go
for those you can't really get your own

9358
04:30:04,349 --> 04:30:04,359
for those you can't really get your own
 

9359
04:30:04,359 --> 04:30:05,870
for those you can't really get your own
build I mean you could but you're

9360
04:30:05,870 --> 04:30:05,880
build I mean you could but you're
 

9361
04:30:05,880 --> 04:30:07,910
build I mean you could but you're
ignoring all the the potential extra

9362
04:30:07,910 --> 04:30:07,920
ignoring all the the potential extra
 

9363

also at the same time gives me a guide I
 

9369
04:30:16,319 --> 04:30:20,070
also at the same time gives me a guide I
guess that for some for a first player

9370
04:30:20,070 --> 04:30:20,080
guess that for some for a first player
 

9371

tells me what's the best thing to do
 

9373
04:30:22,239 --> 04:30:24,630
tells me what's the best thing to do
maybe because as from what I heard it's

9374
04:30:24,630 --> 04:30:24,640
maybe because as from what I heard it's
 

9375
04:30:24,640 --> 04:30:28,189
maybe because as from what I heard it's
not random it's like there's a pattern

9376
04:30:28,189 --> 04:30:28,199
not random it's like there's a pattern
 

9377
04:30:28,199 --> 04:30:33,269
not random it's like there's a pattern
in uh what stats get buffed and maybe

9378
04:30:33,269 --> 04:30:33,279
in uh what stats get buffed and maybe
 

9379
04:30:33,279 --> 04:30:35,750
in uh what stats get buffed and maybe
there's like this whole plan they have

9380

in mind as to what stats are the best to
 

9383
04:30:39,319 --> 04:30:40,950
in mind as to what stats are the best to
get for these characters and that's why

04:32:53,630 --> 04:32:53,640
they attack with their fists this and
 

9487
04:32:53,640 --> 04:32:54,990
they attack with their fists this and
that and then they always attack the

04:32:54,990 --> 04:32:55,000
that and then they always attack the
 

9489
04:32:55,000 --> 04:32:56,870
that and then they always attack the
same way but this this gives it like a

9490
04:32:56,870 --> 04:32:56,880
same way but this this gives it like a
 

9491
04:32:56,880 --> 04:32:59,229
same way but this this gives it like a
lot of variety again so it's like you

cuz there's just general variety is like
 

9497
04:33:03,720 --> 04:33:06,709
cuz there's just general variety is like
