14211
06:34:15,798 --> 06:34:17,150
compared to Fest because Fest is bigger
but that doesn't necessarily make it

14212
06:34:17,150 --> 06:34:17,160
but that doesn't necessarily make it
 

14213
06:34:17,160 --> 06:34:20,510
but that doesn't necessarily make it
better if you are originally an Ian fan

14214
06:34:20,510 --> 06:34:20,520
better if you are originally an Ian fan
 

14215
06:34:20,520 --> 06:34:23,110
better if you are originally an Ian fan
then an Ian concert will be just more

14216
06:34:23,110 --> 06:34:23,120
then an Ian concert will be just more
 

14217
06:34:23,120 --> 06:34:25,910
then an Ian concert will be just more
hype and also a smaller

14218
06:34:25,910 --> 06:34:25,920
hype and also a smaller
 

14219
06:34:25,920 --> 06:34:28,270
hype and also a smaller
venue bigger venue will like be

14220
06:34:28,270 --> 06:34:28,280
venue bigger venue will like be
 

14221
06:34:28,280 --> 06:34:30,190
venue bigger venue will like be
impressive and hype and louder and all

14222
06:34:30,190 --> 06:34:30,200
impressive and hype and louder and all
 

14223
06:34:30,200 --> 06:34:32,150
impressive and hype and louder and all
that but smaller venue can also just be

14224
06:34:32,150 --> 06:34:32,160
that but smaller venue can also just be
 

14225
06:34:32,160 --> 06:34:34,150
that but smaller venue can also just be
more intimate and that's why makes it

14226
06:34:34,150 --> 06:34:34,160
more intimate and that's why makes it
 

14227
06:34:34,160 --> 06:34:36,868
more intimate and that's why makes it
more hype it's all like contained in

14228
06:34:36,868 --> 06:34:36,878
more hype it's all like contained in
 

14229
06:34:36,878 --> 06:34:40,230
more hype it's all like contained in
