197
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,149
GS see who would win five people on
Summoner Rift or a billion GS we just

198
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:34,159
Summoner Rift or a billion GS we just
 

199
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:34,799

existential thoughts of how life is
 

233
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:24,829
existential thoughts of how life is
fleeting and then um um um the world is

ending just kidding it wasn't like that

236
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:26,720
ending just kidding it wasn't like that
 

237
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,630

but I was kind of looking at my schedule
 

239
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,910
but I was kind of looking at my schedule
and stuff and making schedules is

240
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:30,920
and stuff and making schedules is
 

241
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,230
and stuff and making schedules is
definitely one of the hardest thing like

242
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:32,240
definitely one of the hardest thing like
 

243
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,150
definitely one of the hardest thing like
what am I going to stream and I have to

244
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,160
what am I going to stream and I have to
 

245
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,790
what am I going to stream and I have to
make sure it's varied and I have to try

246
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:36,800
make sure it's varied and I have to try
 

247
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,310
make sure it's varied and I have to try
new stuff and and blah blah blah blah

248
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:39,320
new stuff and and blah blah blah blah
 

249
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,790

what about head empty things and then I

252
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:43,760
what about head empty things and then I
 

253
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,710
what about head empty things and then I
was like oh but if I'm going to be here

254
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:46,720
was like oh but if I'm going to be here
 

255
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,230
was like oh but if I'm going to be here
for a long time and then it's definitely

256
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:49,240
for a long time and then it's definitely
 

257
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,030
for a long time and then it's definitely
going to be for a while so I might as

258
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:52,040
going to be for a while so I might as
 

259
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,910
going to be for a while so I might as
well it's like there's a lot of time to

260
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:53,920
well it's like there's a lot of time to
 

261
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,190
well it's like there's a lot of time to
play games so I might as well just play

262
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:56,200
play games so I might as well just play
 

263
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,590
play games so I might as well just play
some some filler TFT and no one will

264
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:58,600
some some filler TFT and no one will
 

265
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,470
some some filler TFT and no one will
mind some fill TFT some head empty

272
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:10,079
TFT and then the next move that I slowly
 

273
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,509
TFT and then the next move that I slowly
make is I start going live randomly

274
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:12,519
make is I start going live randomly
 

275
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:14,949
make is I start going live randomly

I end stream that's probably how the TFT

294
00:10:43,069 --> 00:10:43,079
I end stream that's probably how the TFT
 

295
00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:47,069
I end stream that's probably how the TFT

00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:52,440
yeah I I think in my
 

301
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,790
yeah I I think in my
head I'm definitely like oh but if I

302
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:56,800
head I'm definitely like oh but if I
 

303
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,030
head I'm definitely like oh but if I
stream something then I should be

304
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,040
stream something then I should be
 

305
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,790
stream something then I should be
100% um

306
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:03,800
100% um
 

307
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:08,110
100% um
like I have to be giving 500% and then

308
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:08,120
like I have to be giving 500% and then
 

309
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,069
like I have to be giving 500% and then
sometimes I'm like but when I think

310
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:10,079
sometimes I'm like but when I think
 

311
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,269
sometimes I'm like but when I think
about the kind of content I watch I love

312
00:11:12,269 --> 00:11:12,279
about the kind of content I watch I love
 

313
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:13,829
about the kind of content I watch I love

about that too and I was like that maybe

324
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:23,440
about that too and I was like that maybe
 

325
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,910
about that too and I was like that maybe
I should I should do

326
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:24,920
I should I should do
 

327
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,470
