3008
01:24:27,189 --> 01:24:27,199
with like 400 500 plus
 

3009
01:24:27,199 --> 01:24:29,910

guests uh and I've been to like smaller

3010
01:24:29,910 --> 01:24:29,920
guests uh and I've been to like smaller
 

3011
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:33,990
guests uh and I've been to like smaller
weddings with like only maybe about

3012
01:24:33,990 --> 01:24:34,000

100

3014
01:24:36,470 --> 01:24:36,480
100
 

3015
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:39,430
100
so

3016
01:24:39,430 --> 01:24:39,440
so
 

3017
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:43,669
so
personally I think it

3018
01:24:43,669 --> 01:24:43,679

 

3019
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:45,990

depends I think it depends I don't know

3020
01:24:45,990 --> 01:24:46,000
depends I think it depends I don't know
 

3021
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,950
depends I think it depends I don't know
if I want 100 small well think of it

3022
01:24:48,950 --> 01:24:48,960
if I want 100 small well think of it
 

3023
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:51,350
if I want 100 small well think of it
even if you only invite 50

3024
01:24:51,350 --> 01:24:51,360
even if you only invite 50
 

3025
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:52,870
even if you only invite 50
people

3026
01:24:52,870 --> 01:24:52,880
people
 

3027
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:54,790
people
if you give everyone a plus one and

3028
01:24:54,790 --> 01:24:54,800
if you give everyone a plus one and
 

3029
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:56,229
if you give everyone a plus one and
everyone brings one you're probably

3030
01:24:56,229 --> 01:24:56,239
everyone brings one you're probably
 

3031
01:24:56,239 --> 01:24:59,629
everyone brings one you're probably
going to have about a 100

3032
01:24:59,629 --> 01:24:59,639

 

3033
01:24:59,639 --> 01:25:02,950

guests you know like 100 I would say I

3034
01:25:02,950 --> 01:25:02,960
guests you know like 100 I would say I
 

3035
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:05,070
guests you know like 100 I would say I
don't think 100 is a large

3036
01:25:05,070 --> 01:25:05,080
don't think 100 is a large
 

3037
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:07,189
don't think 100 is a large
wedding I've never been to a wedding

3038
01:25:07,189 --> 01:25:07,199
