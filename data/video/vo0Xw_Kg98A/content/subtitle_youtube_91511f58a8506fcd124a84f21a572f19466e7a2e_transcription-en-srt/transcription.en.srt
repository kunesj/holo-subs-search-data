00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:42,840
time we cannot cheat we have to have the
 

757
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,470
time we cannot cheat we have to have the
same P ideally but since we're six

758
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:45,480
same P ideally but since we're six
 

759
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,870
same P ideally but since we're six
members and that's maybe a little bit

760
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:46,880
members and that's maybe a little bit
 

761
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,110
members and that's maybe a little bit
too difficult we will make it a little

762
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:49,120
too difficult we will make it a little
 

763
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,710
too difficult we will make it a little
bit easier only four members out of the

764
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:51,720
bit easier only four members out of the
 

765
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,830
bit easier only four members out of the
six will have to have the same post if

but if there's four minimum we will get

770
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:58,440
but if there's four minimum we will get
 

771
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,669
but if there's four minimum we will get
at one

772
