4017
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:33,950
now new clue new
options oh you think there's new options

4018
01:51:33,950 --> 01:51:33,960

 

4019
01:51:33,960 --> 01:51:39,510

here I don't

4020
01:51:39,510 --> 01:51:39,520

 

4021
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:41,830

know you think I can solve it and maybe

4022
01:51:41,830 --> 01:51:41,840
know you think I can solve it and maybe
 

4023
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:46,990
know you think I can solve it and maybe
I can brute force it but I guess no BR

4024
01:51:46,990 --> 01:51:47,000
I can brute force it but I guess no BR
 

4025
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:51,109
I can brute force it but I guess no BR
forcing is basically deducting

forcing is basically deducting
 

4027
01:51:51,119 --> 01:51:54,470
forcing is basically deducting
so but he it does say 17 out of 17 so I

02:21:06,319 --> 02:21:08,469
about his uh present he did say it like
as if it's really special so I I think

5106
02:21:08,469 --> 02:21:08,479
as if it's really special so I I think
 

5107
02:21:08,479 --> 02:21:11,030
as if it's really special so I I think
because he also still loves her we all

5120
02:21:34,830 --> 02:21:34,840
cake I totally forgot about Sophie's you
 

5121
02:21:34,840 --> 02:21:36,190
cake I totally forgot about Sophie's you
forgot about Sophie's birthday so you

5122
02:21:36,190 --> 02:21:36,200
forgot about Sophie's birthday so you
 

5123
02:21:36,200 --> 02:21:39,150
forgot about Sophie's birthday so you
didn't gift

5124
02:21:39,150 --> 02:21:39,160
didn't gift
 

5125
02:21:39,160 --> 02:21:41,030
didn't gift
anything but I don't have you on the

5126
02:21:41,030 --> 02:21:41,040
anything but I don't have you on the
 

5127
02:21:41,040 --> 02:21:43,830
anything but I don't have you on the
list anyway right now but that's a good

5128
02:21:43,830 --> 02:21:43,840
list anyway right now but that's a good
 

5129
02:21:43,840 --> 02:21:45,910
list anyway right now but that's a good
deduction he said his gift was romantic

5130
02:21:45,910 --> 02:21:45,920
deduction he said his gift was romantic
 

5131
02:21:45,920 --> 02:21:46,950
deduction he said his gift was romantic
yeah so that's why I think it's the

5132
02:21:46,950 --> 02:21:46,960
yeah so that's why I think it's the
 

5133
02:21:46,960 --> 02:21:50,070
yeah so that's why I think it's the
necklace honestly it's got to be the

5134
02:21:50,070 --> 02:21:50,080
necklace honestly it's got to be the
 

5135
02:21:50,080 --> 02:21:54,389
necklace honestly it's got to be the
necklace is see it became not free or

5136
02:21:54,389 --> 02:21:54,399
necklace is see it became not free or
 

5137
02:21:54,399 --> 02:21:55,910
necklace is see it became not free or
more it became

02:21:55,910 --> 02:21:55,920
more it became
 

5139
02:21:55,920 --> 02:22:00,270
more it became
free so definitely trust me I'm the

5140
