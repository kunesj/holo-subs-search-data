wasn't such a big deal because the

10214
04:53:46,910 --> 04:53:46,920
wasn't such a big deal because the
 

10215
04:53:46,920 --> 04:53:48,830
wasn't such a big deal because the
flight was very late at night which

10216

flight was very late at night which
 

10217
04:53:48,840 --> 04:53:52,070
flight was very late at night which
means that actually having the room for

they used to use the same artist for the
 

11505
05:26:12,360 --> 05:26:14,690
they used to use the same artist for the
early games like again and again and

11506
05:26:14,690 --> 05:26:14,700
early games like again and again and
 

11507
05:26:14,700 --> 05:26:16,250
early games like again and again and
again and then later on they started

11508
05:26:16,250 --> 05:26:16,260
again and then later on they started
 

11509
05:26:16,260 --> 05:26:19,070
again and then later on they started
using different artists and maybe

11510
05:26:19,070 --> 05:26:19,080
using different artists and maybe
 

11511
05:26:19,080 --> 05:26:22,070
using different artists and maybe
maybe it felt the same way like oh this

11512
05:26:22,070 --> 05:26:22,080
maybe it felt the same way like oh this
 

11513
05:26:22,080 --> 05:26:23,448
maybe it felt the same way like oh this
is so unusual

11514
05:26:23,448 --> 05:26:23,458
is so unusual
 

11515
05:26:23,458 --> 05:26:24,830
is so unusual
but

11516
05:26:24,830 --> 05:26:24,840
but
 

11517
05:26:24,840 --> 05:26:27,110
but
I only really got into the atlio games

11518
05:26:27,110 --> 05:26:27,120
I only really got into the atlio games
 

11519
05:26:27,120 --> 05:26:30,708
I only really got into the atlio games
after they started switching artists

11520
05:26:30,708 --> 05:26:30,718
after they started switching artists
 

11521
05:26:30,718 --> 05:26:32,690
after they started switching artists
so I can't quite relate to that feeling

11522
05:26:32,690 --> 05:26:32,700
so I can't quite relate to that feeling
 

11523
05:26:32,700 --> 05:26:35,990
so I can't quite relate to that feeling
until now like for fighting I feel that

11524
05:26:35,990 --> 05:26:36,000
until now like for fighting I feel that
 

11525
05:26:36,000 --> 05:26:38,628
until now like for fighting I feel that
a little bit right now but I only played

the usual style was suddenly changed and

11534
05:26:50,390 --> 05:26:50,400
