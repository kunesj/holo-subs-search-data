it's like a different kind of connection

8000
03:50:43,349 --> 03:50:43,359
it's like a different kind of connection
 

8001
03:50:43,359 --> 03:50:45,670
it's like a different kind of connection
i don't understand or the difference is

8002
03:50:45,670 --> 03:50:45,680
i don't understand or the difference is
 

8003
03:50:45,680 --> 03:50:45,990
i don't understand or the difference is
but

8004
03:50:45,990 --> 03:50:46,000
but
 

8005
03:50:46,000 --> 03:50:47,110
but
apparently it's a different kind of

8006
03:50:47,110 --> 03:50:47,120
apparently it's a different kind of
 

8007
03:50:47,120 --> 03:50:49,269
apparently it's a different kind of
connection and he said that it wouldn't

8008
03:50:49,269 --> 03:50:49,279
connection and he said that it wouldn't
 

8009
03:50:49,279 --> 03:50:49,830
connection and he said that it wouldn't
it

8010
03:50:49,830 --> 03:50:49,840
it
 

8011
03:50:49,840 --> 03:50:52,070
it
it might be fast but it's not very

8012
03:50:52,070 --> 03:50:52,080
it might be fast but it's not very
 

8013
03:50:52,080 --> 03:50:53,110
it might be fast but it's not very
stable

8014
03:50:53,110 --> 03:50:53,120
stable
 

8015
03:50:53,120 --> 03:50:56,630
stable
so yeah but but maybe yeah maybe i just

8016
03:50:56,630 --> 03:50:56,640
so yeah but but maybe yeah maybe i just
 

8017
03:50:56,640 --> 03:50:57,590
so yeah but but maybe yeah maybe i just
get both of them

8018
03:50:57,590 --> 03:50:57,600
get both of them
 

8019
03:50:57,600 --> 03:50:59,990
get both of them
so that i i mainly use the fast one

8020
03:50:59,990 --> 03:51:00,000
so that i i mainly use the fast one
 

8021
03:51:00,000 --> 03:51:02,150
so that i i mainly use the fast one
which apparently is not very stable

8022
03:51:02,150 --> 03:51:02,160
which apparently is not very stable
 

8023
03:51:02,160 --> 03:51:05,269
which apparently is not very stable
but when that one uh like fails then i

8024
03:51:05,269 --> 03:51:05,279
but when that one uh like fails then i
 

8025
03:51:05,279 --> 03:51:07,030
but when that one uh like fails then i
might still be able to

8026
03:51:07,030 --> 03:51:07,040
might still be able to
 

8027
03:51:07,040 --> 03:51:10,229
might still be able to
use the other one

8028
03:51:10,229 --> 03:51:10,239
use the other one
 

8029
03:51:10,239 --> 03:51:13,910
use the other one
but then again having two

8030
03:51:13,910 --> 03:51:13,920
