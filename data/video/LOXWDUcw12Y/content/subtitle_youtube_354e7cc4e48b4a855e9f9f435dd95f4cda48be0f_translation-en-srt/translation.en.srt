Because it was that oxygen, Mr. Sol just

1379
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:30,880
Because it was that oxygen, Mr. Sol just
 

1380
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,549
Because it was that oxygen, Mr. Sol just
disappeared, and the love in the upper right above Noah also disappeared, and someone must have

1381
00:37:33,549 --> 00:37:33,559
disappeared, and the love in the upper right above Noah also disappeared, and someone must have
 

1382
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:36,519
disappeared, and the love in the upper right above Noah also disappeared, and someone must have
lost the three Sols on the right. I wonder

1383
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:36,529
lost the three Sols on the right. I wonder
 

1384
00:37:36,529 --> 00:37:39,160
lost the three Sols on the right. I wonder
if there was someone going to school?

1385
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:39,170
if there was someone going to school?
 

1386
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:42,279
if there was someone going to school?
So I...  Even after I went

1387
00:37:42,279 --> 00:37:42,289
So I...  Even after I went
 

1388
00:37:42,289 --> 00:37:44,500
So I...  Even after I went
to the weapon room and went to the cafe because I thought someone might be dead during the undressing route, there was a

1389
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:47,200
to the weapon room and went to the cafe because I thought someone might be dead during the undressing route, there was a

1391
00:37:50,799 --> 00:37:50,809

 

1392
00:37:50,809 --> 00:37:52,400

difference between the

1393
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:52,410
difference between the
 

1394
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:55,700
difference between the
members and Nibu-chan.  I think it stopped

1395
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:55,710
members and Nibu-chan.  I think it stopped
 

1396
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:58,370
members and Nibu-chan.  I think it stopped
Even though I turned off all the

1397
00:37:58,370 --> 00:37:58,380
Even though I turned off all the
 

1398
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:01,580
Even though I turned off all the
oxygen, there are people who don't admit that they saw it.On the other hand, the person who didn't turn off the oxygen

1399
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:01,590
oxygen, there are people who don't admit that they saw it.On the other hand, the person who didn't turn off the oxygen
 

1400
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:04,010
oxygen, there are people who don't admit that they saw it.On the other hand, the person who didn't turn off the oxygen
didn't come.When I tried to go to Rabin, it

Noel went to the security side, so

3850
01:45:07,340 --> 01:45:07,350
Noel went to the security side, so
 

3851
01:45:07,350 --> 01:45:11,510
Noel went to the security side, so
I went down from the electric to the right side, and

3852
01:45:11,510 --> 01:45:11,520
I went down from the electric to the right side, and
 

3853
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:15,040
I went down from the electric to the right side, and
at that time, it flopped down, so the

3854
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:16,050
at that time, it flopped down, so the
 

3855
01:45:16,050 --> 01:45:16,060

 

3856
01:45:16,060 --> 01:45:19,920

moment Noel came in, another person killed the dog and

3857
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:19,930
moment Noel came in, another person killed the dog and
 

3858
01:45:19,930 --> 01:45:23,430
moment Noel came in, another person killed the dog and
made a U-turn.  But it's not impossible.

3859
01:45:23,430 --> 01:45:23,440
made a U-turn.  But it's not impossible.
 

3860
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:28,830
made a U-turn.  But it's not impossible.
That's what I thought when I was down. If

That's what I thought when I was down. If
 

3862
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:31,290
That's what I thought when I was down. If
the moment I really recovered was security, then it would be

3863
01:45:31,290 --> 01:45:31,300
the moment I really recovered was security, then it would be
 

3864
01:45:31,300 --> 01:45:33,010
the moment I really recovered was security, then it would be
a bit strange. It was a

3865
01:45:33,010 --> 01:45:33,020
a bit strange. It was a
 

3866
01:45:33,020 --> 01:45:34,820
a bit strange. It was a
year ago when I was in Pleo.

3867
