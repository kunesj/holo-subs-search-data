so I think

5606
02:54:10,070 --> 02:54:10,080
so I think
 

5607
02:54:10,080 --> 02:54:14,510
so I think
my my uh spoken

5608
02:54:14,510 --> 02:54:14,520
my my uh spoken
 

5609
02:54:14,520 --> 02:54:17,349
my my uh spoken
translation gets into more detail than

5610
02:54:17,349 --> 02:54:17,359
translation gets into more detail than
 

5611
02:54:17,359 --> 02:54:19,469
translation gets into more detail than
the typed out translation cuz they have

5612
02:54:19,469 --> 02:54:19,479
the typed out translation cuz they have
 

5613
02:54:19,479 --> 02:54:22,550
the typed out translation cuz they have
a limit of letters and while they're

5614
02:54:22,550 --> 02:54:22,560
a limit of letters and while they're
 

5615
02:54:22,560 --> 02:54:25,110
a limit of letters and while they're
typing we already continue talking and

5616
02:54:25,110 --> 02:54:25,120
typing we already continue talking and
 

5617
02:54:25,120 --> 02:54:27,429
typing we already continue talking and
so on I think they do skip some things

5618
02:54:27,429 --> 02:54:27,439
so on I think they do skip some things
 

5619
02:54:27,439 --> 02:54:30,030
so on I think they do skip some things
and stuff

5620
02:54:30,030 --> 02:54:30,040
and stuff
 

5621
02:54:30,040 --> 02:54:34,510
and stuff

5625
02:54:36,200 --> 02:54:39,750
I think those translations are extremely
useful and dope and I think

5626
02:54:39,750 --> 02:54:39,760
useful and dope and I think
 

5627
02:54:39,760 --> 02:54:43,790
useful and dope and I think
um that they help a lot for many

5628
02:54:43,790 --> 02:54:43,800
um that they help a lot for many
 

5629
02:54:43,800 --> 02:54:47,429
um that they help a lot for many
