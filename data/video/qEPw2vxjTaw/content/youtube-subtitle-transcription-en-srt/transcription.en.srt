play-through
 

2649
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:04,950
play-through
and then i saw that there's a remake

2650
01:04:04,950 --> 01:04:04,960
and then i saw that there's a remake
 

2651
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:07,670
and then i saw that there's a remake
being planned being made right now and i

2652
01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:07,680
being planned being made right now and i
 

2653
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:09,430
being planned being made right now and i
was like maybe i should wait for that to

2654
01:04:09,430 --> 01:04:09,440
was like maybe i should wait for that to
 

2655
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,510
was like maybe i should wait for that to
come out

2656
01:04:11,510 --> 01:04:11,520
come out
 

2657
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,510
come out
since i don't think and i don't think we

2658
01:04:13,510 --> 01:04:13,520
since i don't think and i don't think we
 

2659
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:15,190
since i don't think and i don't think we
have permissions for gothic right now

2660
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:15,200
have permissions for gothic right now
 

2661
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:16,950
have permissions for gothic right now
anyway but maybe for the remake it would

2662
01:04:16,950 --> 01:04:16,960
anyway but maybe for the remake it would
 

2663
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,630
anyway but maybe for the remake it would
be easier to get them you know what i

2664
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:18,640
be easier to get them you know what i
 

2665
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:19,430
be easier to get them you know what i
mean

2666

and then yeah i don't know when
 

2669
01:04:21,839 --> 01:04:24,789
