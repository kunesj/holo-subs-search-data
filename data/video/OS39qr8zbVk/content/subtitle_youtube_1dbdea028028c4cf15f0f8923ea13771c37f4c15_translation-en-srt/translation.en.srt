2003
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:15,750
be a flea market or something like that.Maybe there
was an antique shop or something like that in the past.

2004
01:08:15,750 --> 01:08:20,149
was an antique shop or something like that in the past.
 

2005
01:08:20,149 --> 01:08:24,430

 

2006
01:08:24,430 --> 01:08:27,550

 

2007
01:08:27,550 --> 01:08:30,149

 

2008
01:08:30,149 --> 01:08:33,470

 

2009
01:08:33,470 --> 01:08:36,390

 

2010
01:08:36,390 --> 01:08:36,400

 

2011
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:41,149

It's not there, it's this, this, this, this, this, this, this, antique, antique, antique, old, old, old, old, all, ah, antique, antique, antique.  I

2014
01:08:44,279 --> 01:08:46,669

think I've seen a lot of tableware that looks like Kinji's, but I

2015
01:08:46,669 --> 01:08:46,679
think I've seen a lot of tableware that looks like Kinji's, but I
 

2016
01:08:46,679 --> 01:08:50,229
think I've seen a lot of tableware that looks like Kinji's, but I
wonder if it's a fake.  They

2017
01:08:50,229 --> 01:08:50,239
wonder if it's a fake.  They
 

2018
01:08:50,239 --> 01:08:52,749
wonder if it's a fake.  They
only do it on the outside, but it doesn't really matter if it's

2019
01:08:52,749 --> 01:08:52,759
only do it on the outside, but it doesn't really matter if it's
 

2020
01:08:52,759 --> 01:08:56,189
only do it on the outside, but it doesn't really matter if it's
broken or not, it looks like it's because of their eyes, so it's

2021
01:08:56,189 --> 01:08:57,910
broken or not, it looks like it's because of their eyes, so it's
 

2022
01:08:57,910 --> 01:08:57,920

 

2023
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:01,189

fashionable, so they just make it that way.Maybe they

2024
01:09:01,189 --> 01:09:01,199
fashionable, so they just make it that way.Maybe they
 

2025
01:09:01,199 --> 01:09:04,229
fashionable, so they just make it that way.Maybe they
incorporate it into the design.I

2026
01:09:04,229 --> 01:09:04,239
incorporate it into the design.I
 

2027
01:09:04,239 --> 01:09:07,510
incorporate it into the design.I
don't know.  It's not that gold-plated one, but the

2028
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:07,520
don't know.  It's not that gold-plated one, but the
 

2029
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:10,950
don't know.  It's not that gold-plated one, but the
rolls that could be rolled are also made of gold powder.So I put

2030
01:09:10,950 --> 01:09:10,960
rolls that could be rolled are also made of gold powder.So I put
 

2031
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:13,510
rolls that could be rolled are also made of gold powder.So I put
a little bit of lacquer on the surface, and

2032
01:09:13,510 --> 01:09:13,520
a little bit of lacquer on the surface, and
 

2033
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:17,349
a little bit of lacquer on the surface, and
then sprinkled some gold powder on it.

2034
01:09:17,349 --> 01:09:20,630
then sprinkled some gold powder on it.
 

2035
01:09:20,630 --> 01:09:20,640

 

2036

see it for a long time.  I've been

2040
01:09:30,789 --> 01:09:34,550

2041
01:09:34,550 --> 01:09:39,070

 

2042
01:09:39,070 --> 01:09:39,080

 

2043
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:43,950

studying a lot and I

2044
01:09:43,950 --> 01:09:43,960
studying a lot and I
 

2045
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:47,229
studying a lot and I
can speak a lot of things, so thank you very much.I'm

a bit of an expert, so

2048
01:09:53,070 --> 01:09:53,080
a bit of an expert, so
 

2049
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:55,590
a bit of an expert, so
this English pronunciation is

2050
01:09:55,590 --> 01:09:55,600
this English pronunciation is
 

2051
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:58,870
this English pronunciation is
a bit too high, so I suddenly thought it would

2052
01:09:58,870 --> 01:09:58,880
a bit too high, so I suddenly thought it would
 

2053
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:00,990
a bit too high, so I suddenly thought it would
be better to learn from that base.  I

2054
01:10:00,990 --> 01:10:01,000
be better to learn from that base.  I
 

2055
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,950
be better to learn from that base.  I
think I'll do my best from the basics. I've

2056
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:04,960
think I'll do my best from the basics. I've
 

2057
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:11,390
think I'll do my best from the basics. I've

01:10:11,390 --> 01:10:11,400
learned how to say things. She's
 

2059
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:13,149
learned how to say things. She's
cute. I

2060
01:10:13,149 --> 01:10:13,159

2069
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:28,790

But she's really energetic and looks like a dog,

2070
01:10:28,790 --> 01:10:28,800
But she's really energetic and looks like a dog,
 

2071
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:31,790
But she's really energetic and looks like a dog,
so today was the day.  Because I was really looking forward to it,

2072
01:10:31,790 --> 01:10:34,830
so today was the day.  Because I was really looking forward to it,
