feeling that his aggro is kind of always
 

1589
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,150
feeling that his aggro is kind of always
on the one who last hit him which is

1590
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:43,160
on the one who last hit him which is
 

1591
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:46,069
on the one who last hit him which is
probably just my imagination but so what

1592
00:49:46,069 --> 00:49:46,079
probably just my imagination but so what
 

1593
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:48,829
probably just my imagination but so what
the [\h__\h] am I supposed to already heal

1594
00:49:48,829 --> 00:49:48,839
the [\h__\h] am I supposed to already heal

02:57:44,229 --> 02:57:44,239

 

5299
02:57:44,239 --> 02:57:48,870

go debuffs

5300
02:57:48,870 --> 02:57:48,880

 

5301
02:57:48,880 --> 02:57:51,030

increases MP

5302
02:57:51,030 --> 02:57:51,040
increases MP
 

5303
02:57:51,040 --> 02:57:53,750
increases MP
absorption of basic

5304
02:57:53,750 --> 02:57:53,760
absorption of basic
 

5305
02:57:53,760 --> 02:57:55,790
absorption of basic
attacks I don't think I have anything

5306
02:57:55,790 --> 02:57:55,800
attacks I don't think I have anything
 

5307
02:57:55,800 --> 02:58:00,469
attacks I don't think I have anything
that absorbs

5308
02:58:00,469 --> 02:58:00,479

 

5309
02:58:00,479 --> 02:58:05,030

MP I could do electric

5310
02:58:05,030 --> 02:58:05,040
MP I could do electric
 

5311
02:58:05,040 --> 02:58:13,150
MP I could do electric
attacks cuz no wait no he doesn't have

5312
02:58:13,150 --> 02:58:13,160

 

5313
02:58:13,160 --> 02:58:15,550

electric

5314
02:58:15,550 --> 02:58:15,560
electric
 

5315
02:58:15,560 --> 02:58:20,190
electric
Bloodshed yo but not that one right

5316
02:58:20,190 --> 02:58:20,200

 

5317
02:58:20,200 --> 02:58:24,030

what there stronger

5318
02:58:24,030 --> 02:58:24,040

 

5319
02:58:24,040 --> 02:58:27,510

Bloodshed what just this

5320
02:58:27,510 --> 02:58:27,520
Bloodshed what just this
 

5321
02:58:27,520 --> 02:58:31,750
Bloodshed what just this
one you want me to put this one the $5

5322
02:58:31,750 --> 02:58:31,760
one you want me to put this one the $5
 

5323
02:58:31,760 --> 02:58:34,870
one you want me to put this one the $5
one I mean yeah it increases the success

5324
02:58:34,870 --> 02:58:34,880
one I mean yeah it increases the success
 

5325
02:58:34,880 --> 02:58:40,429
one I mean yeah it increases the success
rate even more that makes sense in

5326
02:58:40,429 --> 02:58:40,439

 

5327
02:58:40,439 --> 02:58:43,309

combination but maybe this like bleed is

5328
02:58:43,309 --> 02:58:43,319
combination but maybe this like bleed is
 

5329
02:58:43,319 --> 02:58:46,750
combination but maybe this like bleed is
a debuff so basically I can put this one

5330
02:58:46,750 --> 02:58:46,760
a debuff so basically I can put this one
 

5331
02:58:46,760 --> 02:58:50,429
a debuff so basically I can put this one
on right then it increas es it

5332
02:58:50,429 --> 02:58:50,439
on right then it increas es it
 

5333
02:58:50,439 --> 02:58:53,670
on right then it increas es it
greatly or does this not count for bleed

5334
02:58:53,670 --> 02:58:53,680
greatly or does this not count for bleed
 

5335
02:58:53,680 --> 02:58:56,790
greatly or does this not count for bleed
oh I guess it's not a debuff it's an a

5336
02:58:56,790 --> 02:58:56,800
oh I guess it's not a debuff it's an a
 

5337
02:58:56,800 --> 02:58:59,190
oh I guess it's not a debuff it's an a
is it an a is that

5338
02:58:59,190 --> 02:58:59,200
is it an a is that
 

5339
02:58:59,200 --> 02:59:02,750
is it an a is that
wait a wait is it the same thing in the

5340
02:59:02,750 --> 02:59:02,760
wait a wait is it the same thing in the
 

5341
02:59:02,760 --> 02:59:04,429
wait a wait is it the same thing in the
game or are

5342
02:59:04,429 --> 02:59:04,439
game or are
 

5343
02:59:04,439 --> 02:59:07,550

ailments and debuffs separate but which

5344
02:59:07,550 --> 02:59:07,560
ailments and debuffs separate but which
 

5345
02:59:07,560 --> 02:59:10,030

one is ailman and which one ailman

5346
02:59:10,030 --> 02:59:10,040

out what do we give

5374
02:59:57,510 --> 02:59:57,520
out what do we give
 

5375
02:59:57,520 --> 03:00:00,510
out what do we give
her fire attacks ice attacks electric

5376
03:00:00,510 --> 03:00:00,520
her fire attacks ice attacks electric
 

5377
03:00:00,520 --> 03:00:05,150
her fire attacks ice attacks electric
attacks blade she does do blade attacks

5378
03:00:05,150 --> 03:00:05,160
attacks blade she does do blade attacks
 

5379
03:00:05,160 --> 03:00:09,630
attacks blade she does do blade attacks
a lot but also gun attacks both I gave

5380
03:00:09,630 --> 03:00:09,640
a lot but also gun attacks both I gave
 

5381
03:00:09,640 --> 03:00:12,309
a lot but also gun attacks both I gave
the blade one to uh someone else so

5382
03:00:12,309 --> 03:00:12,319
the blade one to uh someone else so
 

5383
03:00:12,319 --> 03:00:15,870
the blade one to uh someone else so
maybe we can give her the gun

5384
03:00:15,870 --> 03:00:15,880
maybe we can give her the gun
 

5385
03:00:15,880 --> 03:00:18,870
maybe we can give her the gun
one or even the crit why not give

5386
03:00:18,870 --> 03:00:18,880
one or even the crit why not give
 

5387
03:00:18,880 --> 03:00:22,030
one or even the crit why not give
somebody the crit though maybe 10% isn't

5388
03:00:22,030 --> 03:00:22,040
somebody the crit though maybe 10% isn't
 

5389
03:00:22,040 --> 03:00:23,190
somebody the crit though maybe 10% isn't
so

5390
03:00:23,190 --> 03:00:23,200
so
 

5391
03:00:23,200 --> 03:00:27,510
so
much she does apply debuff debuff

5392
03:00:27,510 --> 03:00:27,520
much she does apply debuff debuff
 

5393
03:00:27,520 --> 03:00:31,670
much she does apply debuff debuff
seal debuff what are we debuffing them

seal debuff what are we debuffing them
 

5395
03:00:31,680 --> 03:00:35,429
seal debuff what are we debuffing them
with makes me think again if what's the

5396
03:00:35,429 --> 03:00:35,439
with makes me think again if what's the
 

5397

right does that work together to though

5408
03:00:55,510 --> 03:00:55,520
right does that work together to though
 

5409
03:00:55,520 --> 03:01:01,229
right does that work together to though
I don't know does

5410
03:01:01,229 --> 03:01:01,239

 

5411
03:01:01,239 --> 03:01:04,030

it cuz you know what I'm thinking is if

5412
03:01:04,030 --> 03:01:04,040
it cuz you know what I'm thinking is if
 

5413
03:01:04,040 --> 03:01:08,070
it cuz you know what I'm thinking is if
the game is programmed like this success

03:01:25,710 --> 03:01:25,720
enough to program that or if that's even
 

5427
03:01:25,720 --> 03:01:28,229
enough to program that or if that's even
like what they would want but I guess we

5428
03:01:28,229 --> 03:01:28,239
like what they would want but I guess we
 

5429
03:01:28,239 --> 03:01:31,389
like what they would want but I guess we
can

13067
08:14:42,798 --> 08:14:47,308

then his base attack has got to be

13068
08:14:47,308 --> 08:14:47,318
then his base attack has got to be
 

13069
08:14:47,318 --> 08:14:50,308
then his base attack has got to be
already strong enough in this class and

already strong enough in this class and

then I would think that's true like the
 

13073

then I would think that's true like the
higher his class is the more damage he

13074
08:14:55,590 --> 08:14:55,600
higher his class is the more damage he
 

13075
08:14:55,600 --> 08:14:57,670
