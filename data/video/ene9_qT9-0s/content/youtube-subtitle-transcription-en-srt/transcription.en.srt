if you buy this a lot it's a lot but I

920
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:29,279
if you buy this a lot it's a lot but I
 

921
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,250
if you buy this a lot it's a lot but I
think in Japan you know

922

think in Japan you know
mostly places are very thin walled so

924
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:36,600
mostly places are very thin walled so
 

925
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,990
mostly places are very thin walled so
it's worth the investment if you have a

926
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:39,000
it's worth the investment if you have a

never have to walk up because after
 

2145
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:29,930
never have to walk up because after
going up to the very top and walking

2146
00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:29,940
going up to the very top and walking
 

2147
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:31,910
going up to the very top and walking
around a little bit you will eventually

2148
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:31,920
around a little bit you will eventually
 

2149
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,370
around a little bit you will eventually
be going down to go to the cave and then

2150
00:55:34,370 --> 00:55:34,380
be going down to go to the cave and then
 

2151
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:37,430
be going down to go to the cave and then

2152
00:55:37,430 --> 00:55:37,440
you have to walk back up again in order
 

2153
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,109
you have to walk back up again in order

remember trying out where you ask a

remember trying out where you ask a
 

5205
02:17:46,380 --> 02:17:48,049
remember trying out where you ask a
question or something and then it

5206
02:17:48,049 --> 02:17:48,059
question or something and then it
 

5207
02:17:48,059 --> 02:17:50,750
question or something and then it
answers you with lighting up I think

5208
02:17:50,750 --> 02:17:50,760
answers you with lighting up I think
 

5209
02:17:50,760 --> 02:17:52,730
answers you with lighting up I think
once or twice and depending on how many

5210
02:17:52,730 --> 02:17:52,740
once or twice and depending on how many
 

5211
02:17:52,740 --> 02:17:55,009

02:17:55,009 --> 02:17:55,019
times it lit up and made noises you
 

5213
02:17:55,019 --> 02:17:57,290
times it lit up and made noises you
would get the answer but I was looking

5214
02:17:57,290 --> 02:17:57,300
would get the answer but I was looking
 

5215
02:17:57,300 --> 02:17:59,629
would get the answer but I was looking
forward to that and now somehow that

5216
02:17:59,629 --> 02:17:59,639
forward to that and now somehow that
 

5217
02:17:59,639 --> 02:18:01,429
forward to that and now somehow that
whole mechanism was gone and I'm like

5218
02:18:01,429 --> 02:18:01,439
whole mechanism was gone and I'm like
 

5219
02:18:01,439 --> 02:18:04,190
whole mechanism was gone and I'm like
wait did I imagine that but no it's

5221
02:18:04,200 --> 02:18:05,990

actually gone so it's even less

let's see
 

8839
03:49:50,760 --> 03:49:53,090
let's see
before Kelly came you know I was trying

8840
03:49:53,090 --> 03:49:53,100
before Kelly came you know I was trying
 

8841
03:49:53,100 --> 03:49:56,710
before Kelly came you know I was trying
to have conversation with no idea

8842
03:49:56,710 --> 03:49:56,720
to have conversation with no idea
 

8843
03:49:56,720 --> 03:50:00,170

but it was really hard you want to know

8844
03:50:00,170 --> 03:50:00,180
but it was really hard you want to know
 

8845
03:50:00,180 --> 03:50:01,190
but it was really hard you want to know
why

8846
03:50:01,190 --> 03:50:01,200
why
 

8847
03:50:01,200 --> 03:50:02,690
why
because even though it was a private

8848
03:50:02,690 --> 03:50:02,700
because even though it was a private
 

8849
03:50:02,700 --> 03:50:05,330
because even though it was a private

03:50:11,389 --> 03:50:11,399
but I guess because it was kind of fancy
 

8855
03:50:11,399 --> 03:50:14,929
but I guess because it was kind of fancy

[\h__\h] what's going on this is like
history in the making life changing

9018
03:54:17,290 --> 03:54:17,300
history in the making life changing
 

9019
03:54:17,300 --> 03:54:20,030

from the beginning until the end and I

9020
03:54:20,030 --> 03:54:20,040
from the beginning until the end and I
 

9021
03:54:20,040 --> 03:54:20,990
from the beginning until the end and I
think

9022
03:54:20,990 --> 03:54:21,000

9023
03:54:21,000 --> 03:54:26,090
think
I think maybe just maybe it's because I

9024
03:54:26,090 --> 03:54:26,100

 

9025
03:54:26,100 --> 03:54:27,710
