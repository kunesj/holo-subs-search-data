um yeah well temperature we can still
 

1107
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,190
um yeah well temperature we can still
rule out some

1108
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:33,200
rule out some
 

1109
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,109
rule out some
so um

1110
00:36:37,109 --> 00:36:37,119
so um
 

1111
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:43,270
so um
can be erased

1112
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:43,280

 

1113
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,310

we didn't have emp emf 5 though we only

1114
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:46,320
we didn't have emp emf 5 though we only
 

1115
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,589
we didn't have emp emf 5 though we only
had emf

1116
00:36:47,589 --> 00:36:47,599
had emf
 

1117
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:52,069
had emf
2 unless it booked out

1118
00:36:52,069 --> 00:36:52,079
2 unless it booked out
 

1119
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:53,990
2 unless it booked out
so we can rule out a few more too

1120
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:54,000
so we can rule out a few more too
 

1121
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,670
so we can rule out a few more too
actually
