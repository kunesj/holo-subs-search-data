your MC was in the

2960
01:21:40,590 --> 01:21:40,600
your MC was in the

do something specific that fits that
 

2965
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:48,550
do something specific that fits that
moment right and we were like in the

2966
01:21:48,550 --> 01:21:48,560
moment right and we were like in the
 

2967
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:53,910
moment right and we were like in the
middle is so they wrote down do the wave

2968
01:21:53,910 --> 01:21:53,920
middle is so they wrote down do the wave
 

2969
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:56,270
middle is so they wrote down do the wave
say hi do introductions through the wave

2970
01:21:56,270 --> 01:21:56,280
say hi do introductions through the wave
 

2971
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:58,629
say hi do introductions through the wave
and then do the capture the moment thing

2972
01:21:58,629 --> 01:21:58,639
and then do the capture the moment thing
 

2973
01:21:58,639 --> 01:22:00,390
and then do the capture the moment thing
and that's pretty much it the rest we

2974
01:22:00,390 --> 01:22:00,400
and that's pretty much it the rest we
 

2975
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:03,030
and that's pretty much it the rest we
can do whatever we want uh but even the

2976
01:22:03,030 --> 01:22:03,040
can do whatever we want uh but even the
 

2977
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:05,189
can do whatever we want uh but even the
wave I would say was of course optional

2978
01:22:05,189 --> 01:22:05,199
wave I would say was of course optional
 

2979
01:22:05,199 --> 01:22:07,189
wave I would say was of course optional
we don't have to it's just like an idea

01:24:08,550 --> 01:24:08,560
how about we follow that up with
 

3065
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:11,390
how about we follow that up with
something new that is like similar and

3066
01:24:11,390 --> 01:24:11,400
something new that is like similar and
 

3067
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:13,350
something new that is like similar and
she's like oh that sounds good I like

3068
01:24:13,350 --> 01:24:13,360

3069
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:15,030
she's like oh that sounds good I like
that I like that so I started thinking

3070
01:24:15,030 --> 01:24:15,040
that I like that so I started thinking
 

3071
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:17,110
that I like that so I started thinking
up some things that I could teach her

3072
01:24:17,110 --> 01:24:17,120
up some things that I could teach her
 

3073
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:18,470
up some things that I could teach her
and like thinking of a whole

3074
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:18,480
and like thinking of a whole
 

3075
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:21,270
and like thinking of a whole
conversation that would have a good flow

3076
01:24:21,270 --> 01:24:21,280
conversation that would have a good flow
 

3077
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:22,510
conversation that would have a good flow
and that makes

3078
01:24:22,510 --> 01:24:22,520
and that makes
 

3079
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:25,870
and that makes
sense uh with maybe you know like some

3080
01:24:25,870 --> 01:24:25,880
sense uh with maybe you know like some
 

3081

the points all the Talking Points in my

3150
01:26:23,109 --> 01:26:23,119
the points all the Talking Points in my
 

3151
01:26:23,119 --> 01:26:25,750
the points all the Talking Points in my
brain uh and it was it was difficult I

3152
01:26:25,750 --> 01:26:25,760
brain uh and it was it was difficult I
 

3153
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:26,830
brain uh and it was it was difficult I
was

3154
01:26:26,830 --> 01:26:26,840
was
 

3155
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:29,189
was
nervous such a big

3156
01:26:29,189 --> 01:26:29,199

uh we're like behind the scenes behind
 

3163
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:40,950
uh we're like behind the scenes behind
the stage right and and we're like uh

3164
01:26:40,950 --> 01:26:40,960
the stage right and and we're like uh
 

3165
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:42,669
the stage right and and we're like uh
through the monitor we can like watch

3166
01:26:42,669 --> 01:26:42,679
through the monitor we can like watch
 

3167
01:26:42,679 --> 01:26:45,590
through the monitor we can like watch
the others what's going on and all that

01:26:45,590 --> 01:26:45,600
the others what's going on and all that
 

3169
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:51,310
the others what's going on and all that
and the first MC happens the first

3170
01:26:51,310 --> 01:26:51,320
and the first MC happens the first
 

3171
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:56,070
and the first MC happens the first
MC and they do the wave I'm like

3172
01:26:56,070 --> 01:26:56,080
MC and they do the wave I'm like
 

3173
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:59,189
MC and they do the wave I'm like
there's like a there's a screen here and

3174
01:26:59,189 --> 01:26:59,199
there's like a there's a screen here and
 

3175
01:26:59,199 --> 01:27:01,590
there's like a there's a screen here and
we all like ended up like Gathering

3176
01:27:01,590 --> 01:27:01,600
we all like ended up like Gathering
 

3177
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:05,590
we all like ended up like Gathering
gathering around it you know and I GAA

3178
01:27:05,590 --> 01:27:05,600
gathering around it you know and I GAA
 

3179
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:09,229
gathering around it you know and I GAA
stayed here though and and then I see I

3180
01:27:09,229 --> 01:27:09,239
stayed here though and and then I see I
 

3181
01:27:09,239 --> 01:27:14,870
stayed here though and and then I see I
see the wave and I look back I'm

3182
01:27:14,870 --> 01:27:14,880

 

3183
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:17,149

like I'm like

3184
01:27:17,149 --> 01:27:17,159
like I'm like
 

3185
01:27:17,159 --> 01:27:22,229
like I'm like
Y and she looks to me she's also like y

3186
01:27:22,229 --> 01:27:22,239
Y and she looks to me she's also like y
 

3187
01:27:22,239 --> 01:27:24,189
Y and she looks to me she's also like y
we just give our ourselves these like

3193
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:32,229

eyes for hours we were under the

3194
01:27:32,229 --> 01:27:32,239
eyes for hours we were under the
 

3195
01:27:32,239 --> 01:27:33,870
eyes for hours we were under the
impression we can do the wave and I'm

3196
01:27:33,870 --> 01:27:33,880
impression we can do the wave and I'm
 

3197
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:35,790
impression we can do the wave and I'm
like I mean in hindsight we probably

3198
01:27:35,790 --> 01:27:35,800
like I mean in hindsight we probably
 

3199
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:37,750
like I mean in hindsight we probably
could have but I wanted to like not be

3200
01:27:37,750 --> 01:27:37,760
could have but I wanted to like not be
 

3201
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:40,669
could have but I wanted to like not be
too repetitive you know uh and then on

3202
01:27:40,669 --> 01:27:40,679
too repetitive you know uh and then on
 

3203
01:27:40,679 --> 01:27:43,310
too repetitive you know uh and then on
on the last very last stage free there

3204
01:27:43,310 --> 01:27:43,320
on the last very last stage free there
 

3205
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:46,990
on the last very last stage free there
were like four four wave MC's or so in

3206
01:27:46,990 --> 01:27:47,000
were like four four wave MC's or so in
 

3207
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,430
were like four four wave MC's or so in
the end so maybe I could have done the

3208
01:27:48,430 --> 01:27:48,440
the end so maybe I could have done the
 

3209
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:49,910
the end so maybe I could have done the
second wave yeah but in that moment I

3210
01:27:49,910 --> 01:27:49,920
second wave yeah but in that moment I
 

3211
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:51,910
second wave yeah but in that moment I
thought maybe it's not good to repeat it

3212
01:27:51,910 --> 01:27:51,920
thought maybe it's not good to repeat it
 

3213
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:53,709
thought maybe it's not good to repeat it
maybe may now I got to come up with

3214
01:27:53,709 --> 01:27:53,719
maybe may now I got to come up with
 

3215
01:27:53,719 --> 01:27:57,149
maybe may now I got to come up with
something else so we we got together I'm

3216
01:27:57,149 --> 01:27:57,159
something else so we we got together I'm
 

3217
01:27:57,159 --> 01:28:00,030
something else so we we got together I'm
like I go over I'm like emergency

3218
01:28:00,030 --> 01:28:00,040
like I go over I'm like emergency
 

3219
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:02,910
like I go over I'm like emergency
meeting goba what else can we do and

3220
01:28:02,910 --> 01:28:02,920
meeting goba what else can we do and
 

3221
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:05,270
meeting goba what else can we do and
then goba wanted to do some kind of like

3222
01:28:05,270 --> 01:28:05,280
then goba wanted to do some kind of like
 

3223
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:07,910
then goba wanted to do some kind of like
call and response so I'm like okay okay

3224
01:28:07,910 --> 01:28:07,920
call and response so I'm like okay okay
 

3225
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:09,750

3227
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:13,149
okay leave it to me I'll I'll plan out
the call and response so we were

3228
01:28:13,149 --> 01:28:13,159
the call and response so we were
 

3229
01:28:13,159 --> 01:28:14,430
the call and response so we were
thinking we're going to do like some

3230
01:28:14,430 --> 01:28:14,440
thinking we're going to do like some
 

3231
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:18,109
thinking we're going to do like some
kind of battle where you want to like

3232
01:28:18,109 --> 01:28:18,119
kind of battle where you want to like
 

3233
01:28:18,119 --> 01:28:22,109
kind of battle where you want to like
split um the audience in half two sides

3234
01:28:22,109 --> 01:28:22,119
split um the audience in half two sides
 

3235
01:28:22,119 --> 01:28:24,390
split um the audience in half two sides
and they also will change their colors

3236
01:28:24,390 --> 01:28:24,400
and they also will change their colors
 

3237
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:26,950
and they also will change their colors
right uh into orange and blue and like

3238
01:28:26,950 --> 01:28:26,960
right uh into orange and blue and like
 

3239
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:28,350
right uh into orange and blue and like
split it like

3240
01:28:28,350 --> 01:28:28,360
split it like
 

3241
01:28:28,360 --> 01:28:30,470
split it like
this and then we're going to see who's

3242
01:28:30,470 --> 01:28:30,480
this and then we're going to see who's
 

3243
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:32,510
this and then we're going to see who's
louder so guda will

3244
01:28:32,510 --> 01:28:32,520
louder so guda will
 

3245
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:34,669
louder so guda will
say and they

3246
01:28:34,669 --> 01:28:34,679
say and they
 

3247
01:28:34,679 --> 01:28:38,310
say and they
say but I think they ended up saying Sam

3248
01:28:38,310 --> 01:28:38,320
say but I think they ended up saying Sam
 

3249
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:41,390
say but I think they ended up saying Sam
was thinking they would say Doo but

3250
01:28:41,390 --> 01:28:41,400
was thinking they would say Doo but
 

3251
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:43,830
was thinking they would say Doo but
while we heard everything the Acoustics

3252
01:28:43,830 --> 01:28:43,840
while we heard everything the Acoustics
 

3253
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:45,910
while we heard everything the Acoustics
were kind of confusing so I don't think

3254
01:28:45,910 --> 01:28:45,920
were kind of confusing so I don't think
 

3255
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:48,070
were kind of confusing so I don't think
we heard clearly what people were saying

3256
01:28:48,070 --> 01:28:48,080
we heard clearly what people were saying
 

3257

maybe was looking at the clock

3494
01:34:46,550 --> 01:34:46,560
maybe was looking at the clock
 

3495
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:49,270
maybe was looking at the clock

3496
01:34:49,270 --> 01:34:49,280
too but she told me afterwards that she
 

3497
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:51,830
too but she told me afterwards that she
didn't see it at all she didn't even

3498
01:34:51,830 --> 01:34:51,840
didn't see it at all she didn't even
 

3499
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:54,750
didn't see it at all she didn't even
like realize there was a timer there

3503
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:00,109
she wasn't aware uh and I I tried to
make her aware though by pointing at it

3504

make her aware though by pointing at it
 

3505
01:35:00,119 --> 01:35:02,109

on that stage you know you got to
 

3747
01:41:28,280 --> 01:41:30,310
on that stage you know you got to

3751
01:41:33,159 --> 01:41:40,350

that yeah I think it's free

3752
01:41:40,350 --> 01:41:40,360

 

3753
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:44,270

Halls she thought there was a mirror oh

Halls she thought there was a mirror oh
cuz it's so big well I can see how you

3756
01:41:46,390 --> 01:41:46,400
cuz it's so big well I can see how you
 

3757
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:47,790
cuz it's so big well I can see how you
might think that that would be an insane

3758
01:41:47,790 --> 01:41:47,800
might think that that would be an insane
 

3759
01:41:47,800 --> 01:41:48,910
might think that that would be an insane
mirror

3760
01:41:48,910 --> 01:41:48,920
mirror
 

3761
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:54,149
mirror
though uh so uh the

3762
01:41:54,149 --> 01:41:54,159
though uh so uh the
 

3763
01:41:54,159 --> 01:41:56,510
though uh so uh the
the middle stage was kind of the main

3764
01:41:56,510 --> 01:41:56,520
the middle stage was kind of the main
 

3765
01:41:56,520 --> 01:41:59,270
the middle stage was kind of the main
stage but like here I guess in this case

3766
01:41:59,270 --> 01:41:59,280
stage but like here I guess in this case
 

3767
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:04,189
stage but like here I guess in this case
we're over here I think judging

3768
01:42:04,189 --> 01:42:04,199
we're over here I think judging
 

3769
01:42:04,199 --> 01:42:08,750
we're over here I think judging
by judging by uh the view I think we

3770
01:42:08,750 --> 01:42:08,760
by judging by uh the view I think we
 

3771
01:42:08,760 --> 01:42:13,870
by judging by uh the view I think we
were here on this stage the MC was was

3772
01:42:13,870 --> 01:42:13,880
were here on this stage the MC was was
 

3773
01:42:13,880 --> 01:42:16,070
were here on this stage the MC was was
the MC in the middle stage I actually

3774
01:42:16,070 --> 01:42:16,080
the MC in the middle stage I actually
 

3775
01:42:16,080 --> 01:42:18,270
the MC in the middle stage I actually
don't know where we

3776
01:42:18,270 --> 01:42:18,280
don't know where we
 

3777
01:42:18,280 --> 01:42:20,870
don't know where we
were I actually don't know it was uh

3778
01:42:20,870 --> 01:42:20,880
were I actually don't know it was uh
 

3779
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:24,669
were I actually don't know it was uh
hard to grasp reality do you guys

3780
01:42:24,669 --> 01:42:24,679
hard to grasp reality do you guys
 

3781
01:42:24,679 --> 01:42:30,790
hard to grasp reality do you guys
know and where was where was my

3782
01:42:30,790 --> 01:42:30,800

 

3783
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:33,629

solo it was hard to really grasp where

3784
01:42:33,629 --> 01:42:33,639
solo it was hard to really grasp where
 

3785
01:42:33,639 --> 01:42:34,620
solo it was hard to really grasp where
the [\h__\h] we

3786
01:42:34,620 --> 01:42:34,630
the [\h__\h] we
 

3787
01:42:34,630 --> 01:42:35,750
the [\h__\h] we
[Laughter]

3788
01:42:35,750 --> 01:42:35,760
[Laughter]
 

3789
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:38,669

[Music]
 

3791
01:42:38,679 --> 01:42:43,550
[Music]
are like yeah the osata yeah that's the

3792
01:42:43,550 --> 01:42:43,560
are like yeah the osata yeah that's the
 

3793
01:42:43,560 --> 01:42:45,750
are like yeah the osata yeah that's the
only problem I think there's good sides

3794
01:42:45,750 --> 01:42:45,760
only problem I think there's good sides
 

3795
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:46,750
only problem I think there's good sides
and

3796
01:42:46,750 --> 01:42:46,760
and
 

3797
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:49,350
and
downsides yeah to this like the good

3798
01:42:49,350 --> 01:42:49,360
downsides yeah to this like the good
 

3799
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:51,390
downsides yeah to this like the good
side is that even like let's say there's

3800
01:42:51,390 --> 01:42:51,400
side is that even like let's say there's
 

3801
01:42:51,400 --> 01:42:53,229
side is that even like let's say there's
only one stage and you get like a seat

3802
01:42:53,229 --> 01:42:53,239
only one stage and you get like a seat
 

3803
01:42:53,239 --> 01:42:55,550
only one stage and you get like a seat
over here and there's no side

3804
01:42:55,550 --> 01:42:55,560
over here and there's no side
 

3805
01:42:55,560 --> 01:43:00,229
over here and there's no side
stages yeah then you're kind of oh then

3806
01:43:00,229 --> 01:43:00,239
stages yeah then you're kind of oh then
 

3807
01:43:00,239 --> 01:43:02,709
stages yeah then you're kind of oh then
you're kind of

3808
01:43:02,709 --> 01:43:02,719
you're kind of
 

3809
01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:06,390
you're kind of
um effed maybe but this way you're lucky

3810
01:43:06,390 --> 01:43:06,400
um effed maybe but this way you're lucky
 

3811
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:07,950
um effed maybe but this way you're lucky
because sometimes you know maybe there's

3812
01:43:07,950 --> 01:43:07,960
because sometimes you know maybe there's
 

3813
01:43:07,960 --> 01:43:10,070
because sometimes you know maybe there's
something going on on this stage but

3814
01:43:10,070 --> 01:43:10,080
something going on on this stage but
 

3815
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:13,390
something going on on this stage but
then on other times then on other times

3816
01:43:13,390 --> 01:43:13,400
then on other times then on other times
 

3817
01:43:13,400 --> 01:43:15,270
then on other times then on other times
maybe Oshi appears here but you're all

3818
01:43:15,270 --> 01:43:15,280
maybe Oshi appears here but you're all
 

3819
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:16,910

of being in the front than if there was

3826
01:43:26,669 --> 01:43:26,679
of being in the front than if there was
 

3827
01:43:26,679 --> 01:43:29,030
of being in the front than if there was
only one stage perhaps you were the

3828
01:43:29,030 --> 01:43:29,040
only one stage perhaps you were the
 

3829
01:43:29,040 --> 01:43:30,870
only one stage perhaps you were the
furest from me most of the time ah I'm

3830
01:43:30,870 --> 01:43:30,880
furest from me most of the time ah I'm
 

3831
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:49,910
furest from me most of the time ah I'm
so

3832
01:43:49,910 --> 01:43:49,920

 

3833
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:52,350

sorry gotta positioning I was lucky with

3834
01:43:52,350 --> 01:43:52,360
sorry gotta positioning I was lucky with
 

3835
01:43:52,360 --> 01:43:54,990
sorry gotta positioning I was lucky with
the MC but the was abstracted for me

3836
01:43:54,990 --> 01:43:55,000
the MC but the was abstracted for me
 

3837
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:56,350
the MC but the was abstracted for me
yeah as you can see in the picture

3838
01:43:56,350 --> 01:43:56,360
yeah as you can see in the picture
 

3839
01:43:56,360 --> 01:44:00,430
yeah as you can see in the picture
there's like a few big poles holding the

3840
01:44:00,430 --> 01:44:00,440
there's like a few big poles holding the
 

3841
01:44:00,440 --> 01:44:02,030
there's like a few big poles holding the
venue

3842
01:44:02,030 --> 01:44:02,040
venue
 

3843
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:05,189
venue
together um I

3844
01:44:05,189 --> 01:44:05,199
together um I
 

3845
01:44:05,199 --> 01:44:08,589
together um I
think uh from what I've seen they kept

3846
01:44:08,589 --> 01:44:08,599
think uh from what I've seen they kept
 

3847
01:44:08,599 --> 01:44:11,270
think uh from what I've seen they kept
some space where there were no seats

3848
01:44:11,270 --> 01:44:11,280
some space where there were no seats
 

3849
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:13,990
some space where there were no seats
around it but even then I guess when you

3850
01:44:13,990 --> 01:44:14,000
around it but even then I guess when you
 

3851
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:18,669
around it but even then I guess when you
sit here and you look you look that like

3852
01:44:18,669 --> 01:44:18,679
sit here and you look you look that like
 

3853
01:44:18,679 --> 01:44:20,709
sit here and you look you look that like
why am I doing this with squares you

3854
01:44:20,709 --> 01:44:20,719
why am I doing this with squares you
 

3855
01:44:20,719 --> 01:44:24,629
why am I doing this with squares you
look that way I guess it could be

3856
01:44:24,629 --> 01:44:24,639
look that way I guess it could be
 

3857
01:44:24,639 --> 01:44:26,629
look that way I guess it could be
obstructed

3858
01:44:26,629 --> 01:44:26,639
obstructed
 

3859
01:44:26,639 --> 01:44:29,430
obstructed
yeah it but I think

3860
01:44:29,430 --> 01:44:29,440
yeah it but I think
 

3861
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:32,109
yeah it but I think
still uh this is pretty dope because we

3862
01:44:32,109 --> 01:44:32,119
still uh this is pretty dope because we
 

3863
01:44:32,119 --> 01:44:34,189
still uh this is pretty dope because we
can still stay in the same venue for the

3864
01:44:34,189 --> 01:44:34,199
can still stay in the same venue for the
 

3865
01:44:34,199 --> 01:44:39,350
can still stay in the same venue for the
Expo to be like next to us and uh have a

3866
01:44:39,350 --> 01:44:39,360
Expo to be like next to us and uh have a

02:42:54,040 --> 02:42:57,269
later on they actually did get rid of
them pretty soon after even and didn't
