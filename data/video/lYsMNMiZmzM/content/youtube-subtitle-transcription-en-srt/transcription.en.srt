2480
01:11:38,110 --> 01:11:38,120
multipliers now so if I let's say I have
 

2481
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:40,910
multipliers now so if I let's say I have
two pairs and then I'd have a throwaway

2482
01:11:40,910 --> 01:11:40,920
two pairs and then I'd have a throwaway
 

2483
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:43,430
two pairs and then I'd have a throwaway
card if I put the multiplier on the

2484
01:11:43,430 --> 01:11:43,440
card if I put the multiplier on the
 

2485
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:46,590
card if I put the multiplier on the
throwaway card then it will suddenly be

2486
01:11:46,590 --> 01:11:46,600
throwaway card then it will suddenly be
 

2487
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:51,709
throwaway card then it will suddenly be
useful that's a good way to use it

2488
01:11:51,709 --> 01:11:51,719

 

2489
01:11:51,719 --> 01:11:56,990

do
 

2863
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:11,229
do
that oh but ah this one still had the

2864
01:22:11,229 --> 01:22:11,239
that oh but ah this one still had the
 

2865
01:22:11,239 --> 01:22:13,590
that oh but ah this one still had the
multiplier now I'm like not using it

2866
01:22:13,590 --> 01:22:13,600
multiplier now I'm like not using it
 

2867
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:16,870
multiplier now I'm like not using it
that's so

2868
01:22:16,870 --> 01:22:16,880

 

2869
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:20,669

sad it is what it is right we just need

2870
01:22:20,669 --> 01:22:20,679
sad it is what it is right we just need
 

2871
01:22:20,679 --> 01:22:22,350
sad it is what it is right we just need
one more Heart Card we're definitely

2872

one more Heart Card we're definitely
 

2873
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:25,070
one more Heart Card we're definitely
going to get that it's fine you can use

2874
01:22:25,070 --> 01:22:25,080
going to get that it's fine you can use
 

2875
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:29,950
going to get that it's fine you can use
it later oh does that start stay in

2876
01:22:29,950 --> 01:22:29,960

 

2877
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:33,629

there you can hold

2878
01:22:33,629 --> 01:22:33,639
there you can hold
 

2879
01:22:33,639 --> 01:22:36,510
there you can hold
it I can keep it if I want I mean what's

2880
01:22:36,510 --> 01:22:36,520
it I can keep it if I want I mean what's
 

2881
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:38,110
it I can keep it if I want I mean what's
the point if we're probably getting a

2882
01:22:38,110 --> 01:22:38,120
the point if we're probably getting a
 

2883
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:40,750
the point if we're probably getting a
heart so we're just going to play it

2884
01:22:40,750 --> 01:22:40,760
heart so we're just going to play it
 

2885
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:44,030
heart so we're just going to play it
right so I don't know yeah it reshuffles

2886
01:22:44,030 --> 01:22:44,040
right so I don't know yeah it reshuffles
 

2887
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:47,669
right so I don't know yeah it reshuffles
after every blun okay

2888
01:22:47,669 --> 01:22:47,679

 

2889
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:51,870

discard I think one two three we got

2890
01:22:51,870 --> 01:22:51,880
discard I think one two three we got
 

2891
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:55,950
discard I think one two three we got
one and now should I sort by r no I

2892
01:22:55,950 --> 01:22:55,960
one and now should I sort by r no I
 

2893
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:59,629
one and now should I sort by r no I
guess it's sorted by rank already as

2894
01:22:59,629 --> 01:22:59,639
guess it's sorted by rank already as
 

2895
01:22:59,639 --> 01:23:03,750
guess it's sorted by rank already as
well so throwing it in like this is

2896
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:03,760
well so throwing it in like this is
 

2897
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:06,750
well so throwing it in like this is
fine yay flush almost a straight FL is a

no I don't

2950
01:24:26,470 --> 01:24:26,480
no I don't
 

2951
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:29,070
no I don't
know at two pair wi so we can discard

2952
01:24:29,070 --> 01:24:29,080
know at two pair wi so we can discard
 

2953
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:30,910

will I know after this like how many
sevens I have I guess when they're

5262
02:29:17,230 --> 02:29:17,240
sevens I have I guess when they're
 

5263

5908
02:46:56,349 --> 02:46:56,359

5909
02:46:56,359 --> 02:46:57,670

if there's sevens in there but we

5910
02:46:57,670 --> 02:46:57,680
if there's sevens in there but we
 

5911
02:46:57,680 --> 02:46:59,230
if there's sevens in there but we
wouldn't know so okay yeah I guess that

5912
02:46:59,230 --> 02:46:59,240
wouldn't know so okay yeah I guess that
 

5913
02:46:59,240 --> 02:47:01,269
wouldn't know so okay yeah I guess that
makes sense

5914
02:47:01,269 --> 02:47:01,279
makes sense
 

5915
02:47:01,279 --> 02:47:05,349
makes sense
yeah that makes sense

5916
02:47:05,349 --> 02:47:05,359
yeah that makes sense
 

5917
02:47:05,359 --> 02:47:09,670

um or what this car wait what the

5918
02:47:09,670 --> 02:47:09,680
um or what this car wait what the
 

5919
02:47:09,680 --> 02:47:11,670
um or what this car wait what the
firstand so if I wait wait wait okay

5920
02:47:11,670 --> 02:47:11,680

5921
02:47:11,680 --> 02:47:15,110

9741
04:25:48,520 --> 04:25:51,590
