like a final episode or or like um
I don't know

3612
01:48:32,570 --> 01:48:32,580
I don't know
 

3613
01:48:32,580 --> 01:48:34,729
I don't know
the end of an era but it wasn't really

3614
01:48:34,729 --> 01:48:34,739
the end of an era but it wasn't really
 

3615
01:48:34,739 --> 01:48:37,010
the end of an era but it wasn't really
because like I checked the episodes and

3616
01:48:37,010 --> 01:48:37,020
because like I checked the episodes and
 

3617
01:48:37,020 --> 01:48:38,510
because like I checked the episodes and
they're still like three four episodes

3618
01:48:38,510 --> 01:48:38,520
they're still like three four episodes
 

3619
01:48:38,520 --> 01:48:40,669
they're still like three four episodes
left so I really wonder why they did

3620
01:48:40,669 --> 01:48:40,679
left so I really wonder why they did
 

3621
01:48:40,679 --> 01:48:42,169
left so I really wonder why they did

season that's just what's confusing me
 

3625
01:48:45,060 --> 01:48:46,790
season that's just what's confusing me
because the episode afterwards is

3626
01:48:46,790 --> 01:48:46,800
because the episode afterwards is
 

3627
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:49,129
because the episode afterwards is
completely back to normal again to the

3628

reasons for me playing it so much in
 

9745
04:34:02,160 --> 04:34:06,289
reasons for me playing it so much in
totk's case is there was so much that I

9746
04:34:06,289 --> 04:34:06,299
totk's case is there was so much that I
 

9747
04:34:06,299 --> 04:34:10,070
totk's case is there was so much that I
felt like it it wouldn't be a loss to

04:34:10,070 --> 04:34:10,080
felt like it it wouldn't be a loss to
 

9749
04:34:10,080 --> 04:34:12,830
felt like it it wouldn't be a loss to
not stream it it would actually only

9750
04:34:12,830 --> 04:34:12,840
not stream it it would actually only
 

9751
04:34:12,840 --> 04:34:15,709
not stream it it would actually only
help the playthrough if I were to not

9752
04:34:15,709 --> 04:34:15,719
help the playthrough if I were to not
 

9753
04:34:15,719 --> 04:34:18,890
help the playthrough if I were to not
stream it and like a lot of side stuff

9754
04:34:18,890 --> 04:34:18,900
stream it and like a lot of side stuff
 

9755
04:34:18,900 --> 04:34:21,051
stream it and like a lot of side stuff
that takes a lot of time at the same

9756
04:34:21,051 --> 04:34:21,061
that takes a lot of time at the same
 

9757
04:34:21,061 --> 04:34:23,269
that takes a lot of time at the same
time it's not like it's boring stuff

9758
04:34:23,269 --> 04:34:23,279
time it's not like it's boring stuff
 

9759
04:34:23,279 --> 04:34:25,609
time it's not like it's boring stuff
it's still very entertaining for me

9765
04:34:28,439 --> 04:34:31,789
yeah
it's like I think uh we only benefited

9766
04:34:31,789 --> 04:34:31,799
it's like I think uh we only benefited
 

9767
04:34:31,799 --> 04:34:35,209
it's like I think uh we only benefited
from me doing the side stuff mostly off

9768
04:34:35,209 --> 04:34:35,219
from me doing the side stuff mostly off
 

9769
04:34:35,219 --> 04:34:37,910
from me doing the side stuff mostly off

04:34:42,349 --> 04:34:42,359
um I know that when seriouses go on for
 

9777
04:34:42,359 --> 04:34:44,209
um I know that when seriouses go on for
too long then they overstay their

9778
04:34:44,209 --> 04:34:44,219
too long then they overstay their
 

9779
04:34:44,219 --> 04:34:45,709
too long then they overstay their
welcome as well and then it's less fun

9780
04:34:45,709 --> 04:34:45,719
welcome as well and then it's less fun
 

9781
04:34:45,719 --> 04:34:47,150
welcome as well and then it's less fun
for you guys as well

so I think it made the series a lot more
 

9785
04:34:49,859 --> 04:34:51,470
so I think it made the series a lot more
compact

9786
04:34:51,470 --> 04:34:51,480
compact
 

9787
04:34:51,480 --> 04:34:54,830
compact
