when we were together with Marin, we were both embarrassed,

1369
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:30,720
when we were together with Marin, we were both embarrassed,
 

1370
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,030
when we were together with Marin, we were both embarrassed,
so we tried not to touch each other anymore.  I was

1371
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:34,040

1385
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:01,349

turned on the air conditioner to prevent the noise. I think that's totally possible.

1386
00:52:01,349 --> 00:52:01,359
turned on the air conditioner to prevent the noise. I think that's totally possible.
 

1387
