or bored as well
 

2629
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,190
or bored as well
and so that's

2630
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:33,200
and so that's
 

2631
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,069
and so that's
what

2632
00:56:34,069 --> 00:56:34,079
what
 

2633
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:36,390

00:56:39,030 --> 00:56:39,040
uh the air ever made it like move
 

2637

uh the air ever made it like move
outside so that's

7306
02:49:11,269 --> 02:49:11,279
the storyboard and like decided on like
 

7307
02:49:11,279 --> 02:49:13,510
the storyboard and like decided on like
what i want and all that

7308
02:49:13,510 --> 02:49:13,520
what i want and all that
 

7309
02:49:13,520 --> 02:49:16,550
what i want and all that
to be honest like i know the 80s only

7310
02:49:16,550 --> 02:49:16,560
to be honest like i know the 80s only
 

7311
02:49:16,560 --> 02:49:19,590
to be honest like i know the 80s only
very superficially obviously and i

7312
02:49:19,590 --> 02:49:19,600
very superficially obviously and i
 

7313
02:49:19,600 --> 02:49:22,550
very superficially obviously and i
couldn't think of much that was

7314
02:49:22,550 --> 02:49:22,560
couldn't think of much that was
 

7315
02:49:22,560 --> 02:49:26,469
couldn't think of much that was
80s and 70s to me

7316
02:49:26,469 --> 02:49:26,479
80s and 70s to me
