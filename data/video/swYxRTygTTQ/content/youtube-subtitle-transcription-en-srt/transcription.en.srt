i had a delay
 

3445
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:25,430
i had a delay
that that was why the whole like taking

3446
01:13:25,430 --> 01:13:25,440
that that was why the whole like taking
 

3447
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:26,790
that that was why the whole like taking
a photo

3448
01:13:26,790 --> 01:13:26,800
a photo
 

3449
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:29,590
a photo
section was so awkward and the times in

3450
01:13:29,590 --> 01:13:29,600
section was so awkward and the times in
 

3451
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:31,350
section was so awkward and the times in
between when the dancers put on like

3452
01:13:31,350 --> 01:13:31,360
between when the dancers put on like
 

3453
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:33,270
between when the dancers put on like
their knee protectors

3454
01:13:33,270 --> 01:13:33,280
their knee protectors
 

3455
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:35,110
their knee protectors
i didn't know when they were done

3456
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:35,120
i didn't know when they were done
 

3457
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:37,669
i didn't know when they were done
because my video feed was 10 seconds

3458
01:13:37,669 --> 01:13:37,679
because my video feed was 10 seconds
 

3459
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:41,030
because my video feed was 10 seconds
delayed i had no audio feedback

3460
01:13:41,030 --> 01:13:41,040
delayed i had no audio feedback
 

3461
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:41,910
delayed i had no audio feedback
uh

3462
01:13:41,910 --> 01:13:41,920
uh
 

3463
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:42,790
uh
so

3464
01:13:42,790 --> 01:13:42,800
so
 

3465
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:46,229
so
it was really awkward

3466
01:13:46,229 --> 01:13:46,239
it was really awkward
 

3467
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:48,790
it was really awkward

3471
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,149
especially the photo part because i was
trying to communicate to them that i
