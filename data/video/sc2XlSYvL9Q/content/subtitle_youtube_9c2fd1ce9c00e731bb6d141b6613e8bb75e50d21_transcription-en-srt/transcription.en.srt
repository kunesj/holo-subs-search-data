00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:06,910
you came prepared let's say it like that
um

294
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:06,920
um
 

295
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:11,630
um
is that for me also like I think it was

296
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:11,640
is that for me also like I think it was
 

297
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,550
is that for me also like I think it was
um maybe it's

298
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:13,560
um maybe it's
 

299
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,710
um maybe it's
it's kind of applies to all of myth but

300
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:15,720
it's kind of applies to all of myth but
 

301
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,110
it's kind of applies to all of myth but
you know especially for me

302
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:18,120
you know especially for me
 

303
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,030
you know especially for me
um because like I'm like a part-time

304
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:20,040
um because like I'm like a part-time
 

305
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,190
um because like I'm like a part-time
Warrior

306
