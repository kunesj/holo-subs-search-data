uh calling it Africa TV gives it like
the impression maybe that it's like it

462
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:22,160
the impression maybe that it's like it
 

463
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,309
the impression maybe that it's like it
belongs to one country or so and and

464
00:16:25,309 --> 00:16:25,319
belongs to one country or so and and

really

2158
01:02:30,589 --> 01:02:30,599
really
 

2159
01:02:30,599 --> 01:02:32,789
really
know I did it right this time but

2160
01:02:32,789 --> 01:02:32,799
know I did it right this time but
 

2161
01:02:32,799 --> 01:02:34,870
know I did it right this time but
normally I [\h__\h] up but it's it's usually

2162
01:02:34,870 --> 01:02:34,880
normally I [\h__\h] up but it's it's usually
 

2163
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:36,109
normally I [\h__\h] up but it's it's usually
fine I

2164
01:02:36,109 --> 01:02:36,119
fine I
 

2165
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:39,069

horny meter makes up maybe for a less

2168
01:02:42,349 --> 01:02:42,359
horny meter makes up maybe for a less
 

2169
01:02:42,359 --> 01:02:46,069
horny meter makes up maybe for a less
efficient

2170
01:02:46,069 --> 01:02:46,079

 

2171
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:49,549

ulti I would say oh I got the ulti right

2172
01:02:49,549 --> 01:02:49,559
ulti I would say oh I got the ulti right
 

2173
01:02:49,559 --> 01:02:50,910
ulti I would say oh I got the ulti right
back

2174
01:02:50,910 --> 01:02:50,920
back
 

2175
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:53,349
back
again because the horn meter is is

2176
01:02:53,349 --> 01:02:53,359
again because the horn meter is is
 

2177
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:58,990
again because the horn meter is is
pretty good I must say

2178
01:02:58,990 --> 01:02:59,000

 

2179
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,390

also I guess maybe it's less about

2180
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:00,400
also I guess maybe it's less about
 

2181
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,349
also I guess maybe it's less about
clearing everything on the board and

4004
01:52:52,149 --> 01:52:52,159
stream cuz today I mean it worked out
 

4005
01:52:52,159 --> 01:52:55,270
stream cuz today I mean it worked out
pretty well but there was some delay I

4006
01:52:55,270 --> 01:52:55,280
pretty well but there was some delay I
 

4007
01:52:55,280 --> 01:52:58,629
pretty well but there was some delay I
think in how early each of us heard

4008
01:52:58,629 --> 01:52:58,639
think in how early each of us heard
 

4009
01:52:58,639 --> 01:53:00,470
think in how early each of us heard
maybe a little bit not too much though

4010
01:53:00,470 --> 01:53:00,480
maybe a little bit not too much though
 

4011
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:04,030
maybe a little bit not too much though
because uh I think staff s played the

4012
01:53:04,030 --> 01:53:04,040
because uh I think staff s played the
 

4013
01:53:04,040 --> 01:53:08,669
because uh I think staff s played the
music I think so yeah if one of us would

4014
01:53:08,669 --> 01:53:08,679
music I think so yeah if one of us would
 

4015
01:53:08,679 --> 01:53:09,550
music I think so yeah if one of us would
have played it there would have been

4016
01:53:09,550 --> 01:53:09,560
have played it there would have been
 

4017
01:53:09,560 --> 01:53:14,229
have played it there would have been
more delay but staan played it

4018
01:53:14,229 --> 01:53:14,239

 

4019
01:53:14,239 --> 01:53:16,229

so I feel like there was a tiny bit

4020
01:53:16,229 --> 01:53:16,239
so I feel like there was a tiny bit
 

4021
01:53:16,239 --> 01:53:17,390
so I feel like there was a tiny bit
delay but not as much as that could have

4022
01:53:17,390 --> 01:53:17,400
delay but not as much as that could have
 

4023
01:53:17,400 --> 01:53:19,669
delay but not as much as that could have
been but also not ideal like if if we're

in the enir
 

5443
02:31:50,720 --> 02:31:53,790
in the enir
the frey environment where if we walk

5444
02:31:53,790 --> 02:31:53,800
the frey environment where if we walk
 

5445
02:31:53,800 --> 02:31:56,910
the frey environment where if we walk
through this portal the whole map or so

5446

6781
03:09:33,720 --> 03:09:35,630
say that that's an important Point
that's missing here in the instructions

6782
03:09:35,630 --> 03:09:35,640
that's missing here in the instructions
 

6783

making it with the original instruction
 

6805
03:10:18,880 --> 03:10:21,030

6845
03:11:17,720 --> 03:11:20,229

noodles back in they probably probably

6846
03:11:20,229 --> 03:11:20,239
noodles back in they probably probably
 

6847
03:11:20,239 --> 03:11:23,190

just at that point they expect you to

just at that point they expect you to
 

6849
03:11:23,200 --> 03:11:25,630
just at that point they expect you to
put the noodles into a bowl finish

6850
03:11:25,630 --> 03:11:25,640
put the noodles into a bowl finish
 

6851
03:11:25,640 --> 03:11:27,670
put the noodles into a bowl finish
cooking the soup and then top the

6852

that's 5D chest yeah I think also like

6862
03:11:54,950 --> 03:11:54,960
that's 5D chest yeah I think also like
 

6863
03:11:54,960 --> 03:11:58,750
that's 5D chest yeah I think also like
once the real product is out um the

6864
03:11:58,750 --> 03:11:58,760
once the real product is out um the
 

6865
03:11:58,760 --> 03:12:00,590
once the real product is out um the
instructions will probably just be these

03:12:00,590 --> 03:12:00,600
instructions will probably just be these
 

6867
03:12:00,600 --> 03:12:02,269

maybe this is a hack you that you guys

6874
03:12:09,309 --> 03:12:09,319
maybe this is a hack you that you guys
 

6875
03:12:09,319 --> 03:12:14,990
maybe this is a hack you that you guys
can also

6877
03:12:15,000 --> 03:12:17,670

use based on the

sounds like you need to strain most of
 

6881
03:12:19,040 --> 03:12:21,590
sounds like you need to strain most of
