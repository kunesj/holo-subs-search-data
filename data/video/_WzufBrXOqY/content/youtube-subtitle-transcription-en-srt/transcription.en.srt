00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:52,480
so her answer is
 

365
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,590
so her answer is
she knows no you don't

366
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:57,600

 

367
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,389

375
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,829

so she says yes

376
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:16,839

377
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,590

391
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,510
and we did not have to deal with adam
because he

392
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:47,520

look the way it looks in the photos but

2512
01:26:28,550 --> 01:26:28,560
look the way it looks in the photos but
 

2513
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:31,350
look the way it looks in the photos but
but it was such an important part of the

2514
01:26:31,350 --> 01:26:31,360
but it was such an important part of the
 

2515
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:32,310
but it was such an important part of the
room

2516
01:26:32,310 --> 01:26:32,320
room
 

2517
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:34,070
room
and literally the reason why we booked

2518
01:26:34,070 --> 01:26:34,080
and literally the reason why we booked
 

2519
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:35,669
and literally the reason why we booked
it and the thing is like we we went

2520
01:26:35,669 --> 01:26:35,679
it and the thing is like we we went
 

2521
01:26:35,679 --> 01:26:37,830
it and the thing is like we we went
outside to the pool area

2522
01:26:37,830 --> 01:26:37,840
outside to the pool area
 

2523
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:39,990
outside to the pool area
of our room and we looked left and then

2524
01:26:39,990 --> 01:26:40,000
of our room and we looked left and then
 

2525
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,990
of our room and we looked left and then
there was the same room next to us

2526
01:26:41,990 --> 01:26:42,000
there was the same room next to us
 

2527
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,990
there was the same room next to us
supposedly the same room category but

2528
01:26:43,990 --> 01:26:44,000
supposedly the same room category but
 

2529
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,390
supposedly the same room category but
that room had the thing

2530
01:26:46,390 --> 01:26:46,400
that room had the thing
 

2531
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:48,870
that room had the thing
that room had the thing and the room

2532
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:48,880
that room had the thing and the room
 

2533
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:50,629
that room had the thing and the room
next to it as well the room next to it

2534
01:26:50,629 --> 01:26:50,639
next to it as well the room next to it
 

2535
01:26:50,639 --> 01:26:53,669
next to it as well the room next to it
as well in the room next to it as well

2536
01:26:53,669 --> 01:26:53,679
as well in the room next to it as well
 

2537
01:26:53,679 --> 01:26:58,149
as well in the room next to it as well
so both me and rmt

2538
01:26:58,149 --> 01:26:58,159
so both me and rmt
 

2539
01:26:58,159 --> 01:27:01,669
so both me and rmt
start getting pretty mad because

2540
01:27:01,669 --> 01:27:01,679
start getting pretty mad because
 

2541
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:03,590
start getting pretty mad because
if it doesn't have the thing that we

2542
01:27:03,590 --> 01:27:03,600
if it doesn't have the thing that we
 

2543
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:05,430
if it doesn't have the thing that we
could have just booked a cheaper room

2544
01:27:05,430 --> 01:27:05,440
could have just booked a cheaper room
 

2545
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:06,629
could have just booked a cheaper room
because other than that

2546
01:27:06,629 --> 01:27:06,639
because other than that
 

2547
01:27:06,639 --> 01:27:09,350
because other than that
there is barely a difference even the

2548
01:27:09,350 --> 01:27:09,360
there is barely a difference even the
 

2549
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:12,390
there is barely a difference even the
bathroom is smaller

2550
01:27:12,390 --> 01:27:12,400
bathroom is smaller
 

2551
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:15,990
bathroom is smaller

be a karen we tried but we failed
 

2569
01:27:35,679 --> 01:27:36,310
be a karen we tried but we failed
because
