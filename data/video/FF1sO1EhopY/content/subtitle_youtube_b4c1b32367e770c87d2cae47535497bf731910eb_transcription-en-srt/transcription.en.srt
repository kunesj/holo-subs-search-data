yeah so the blueprints that i saw

386
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:39,760
yeah so the blueprints that i saw
 

387
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,269
yeah so the blueprints that i saw
require

388
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:41,279
require
 

389
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,550
require
uh like a

390
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:44,560
uh like a
 

391
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,990
uh like a
block down here so the the rail

392
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:48,000
block down here so the the rail
 

393
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,590
block down here so the the rail
would be this height where this block is

394
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:51,600
would be this height where this block is
 

395
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,189
would be this height where this block is
here but because your floor

396
00:13:53,189 --> 00:13:53,199
here but because your floor
 

397
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,629
here but because your floor
is essentially this block we either have

398
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:56,639
is essentially this block we either have
 

399
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,870
is essentially this block we either have
to raise it on the inside by one block

400
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:58,880
to raise it on the inside by one block
 

401
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,069
to raise it on the inside by one block
so we can dig this out

402
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:00,079
so we can dig this out
 

403
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,509
so we can dig this out
and then put it back because we need to

404
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:01,519
and then put it back because we need to
 

405
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,350
and then put it back because we need to
get in there to be able to put the rails

406
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:03,360
get in there to be able to put the rails
 

407
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,629
get in there to be able to put the rails
on this level

408
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:04,639
on this level
 

409
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,629
on this level
so that uh it can collect the eggs at

410
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:06,639
so that uh it can collect the eggs at
 

411
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:13,110
so that uh it can collect the eggs at
the right height

412
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:13,120

 

413
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,910

i am confused i am confused uh what is

414
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:15,920
i am confused i am confused uh what is
 

415
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,470
i am confused i am confused uh what is
the better option mrs amelia watson

416
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:18,480
the better option mrs amelia watson
 

417
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,470
the better option mrs amelia watson
um let me let me let me assess the

418
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:22,480
um let me let me let me assess the
 

419
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:28,829
um let me let me let me assess the
situation here

420
00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:28,839

 

421
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:30,230

um

422
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:30,240
um
 

423
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,430
um
i think what we could do here is we'll

424
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:33,440
i think what we could do here is we'll
 

425
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,069
i think what we could do here is we'll
kill

426
00:14:34,069 --> 00:14:34,079
kill
 

427
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,509
kill
like half of them okay

428
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:37,519
like half of them okay
 

429
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,030
like half of them okay
i don't have enough eggs why why would

430
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:41,040
i don't have enough eggs why why would
 

431
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,230
i don't have enough eggs why why would
the kill half of them what is that

432
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:42,240
the kill half of them what is that
 

433
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,829
the kill half of them what is that
necessary

434
00:14:45,829 --> 00:14:45,839

 

435
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,670

we'll split it in half with a fence and

436
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:47,680
we'll split it in half with a fence and
 

437
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,790
we'll split it in half with a fence and
then we'll kill one half

438
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:50,800
then we'll kill one half
 

439
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,590
then we'll kill one half
one so that we can fill that half with

440
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:53,600
one so that we can fill that half with
 

441
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,069
one so that we can fill that half with
dirt

442
00:14:54,069 --> 00:14:54,079
dirt
 

443
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:55,910
dirt
and then bring the other chickens from

444
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:55,920
and then bring the other chickens from
 

445
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,509
and then bring the other chickens from
the other side onto the raised

446
00:14:57,509 --> 00:14:57,519
the other side onto the raised
 

447
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,790
the other side onto the raised
dirt and then we can fill it fill the

448
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:00,800
dirt and then we can fill it fill the
 

449
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,629
dirt and then we can fill it fill the
other half with dirt so that

450
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:02,639
other half with dirt so that
 

451
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:07,750
other half with dirt so that
we fill the whole thing but in in steps

452
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:07,760

 

453
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,670

yep glitches really go endlessly what if
 

1041
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,630
yep glitches really go endlessly what if
we log out what if

1042
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:46,640
we log out what if
 

1043
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,149
we log out what if
does it still collect when we're all

1044
00:29:48,149 --> 00:29:48,159
does it still collect when we're all
 

1045
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,470
does it still collect when we're all
logged out uh it should

1046
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:50,480
logged out uh it should
 

1047
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,149
logged out uh it should
i think so then uh the chest we would

1048
00:29:54,149 --> 00:29:54,159
i think so then uh the chest we would
 

1049
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,029
i think so then uh the chest we would
put like here

1050
00:29:57,029 --> 00:29:57,039

 

1051
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:59,190

and then uh we could shorten this to

1052
00:29:59,190 --> 00:29:59,200
and then uh we could shorten this to
 

1053
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,070
and then uh we could shorten this to
make it like

1054
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:00,080
make it like
 

1055
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,510
make it like
two steps instead of three

1581
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,390

well then i i have to i have to think

1582
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:32,400
well then i i have to i have to think
 

1583
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,990
well then i i have to i have to think
about how we're gonna make this or where

1584
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:34,000
about how we're gonna make this or where
 

1585
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:34,710
about how we're gonna make this or where
we're gonna make

1586
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:34,720
we're gonna make
 

1587
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:39,750
we're gonna make
it okay let me think about it a bit

1588
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:39,760

 

1589
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,430

because i kind of i guess the pyramid

1590
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:41,440
because i kind of i guess the pyramid
 

1591
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,470
because i kind of i guess the pyramid
the upside down pyramid is like the most

1592
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:44,480
the upside down pyramid is like the most
 

1593
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,309
the upside down pyramid is like the most
it doesn't have to be yeah i guess it

1594
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:46,319
it doesn't have to be yeah i guess it
 

1595
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:47,910
it doesn't have to be yeah i guess it
makes sense for it to be an upside-down

1596
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:47,920
makes sense for it to be an upside-down
 

1597
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,910
makes sense for it to be an upside-down
pyramid

1598
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:49,920
pyramid
 

1599
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,270

3281
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:32,950
we're gonna be building a upside down
pyramid

3282
01:26:32,950 --> 01:26:32,960
pyramid
 

3283
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:35,350
pyramid
so i don't know exactly how to start it

3284
01:26:35,350 --> 01:26:35,360
so i don't know exactly how to start it

3301
01:26:57,120 --> 01:27:00,790

uh the base here is that the smallest

3302
01:27:00,790 --> 01:27:00,800
uh the base here is that the smallest
 

3303
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:03,110
uh the base here is that the smallest
point of the tip of the

3304
01:27:03,110 --> 01:27:03,120
point of the tip of the
 

3305
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:06,310
point of the tip of the
pyramid or do i build a tiny tip on

3306
01:27:06,310 --> 01:27:06,320
pyramid or do i build a tiny tip on
 

3307
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:10,629
pyramid or do i build a tiny tip on
on top of that

3308
01:27:10,629 --> 01:27:10,639

 

3309
01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:15,669

01:27:41,910 --> 01:27:41,920
hey you can like do a little guide okay
 

3331
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:46,790
hey you can like do a little guide okay
i'm coming up

3332
01:27:46,790 --> 01:27:46,800
i'm coming up
 

3333
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:50,310
i'm coming up
you know that uh deutsche technology is

3334
01:27:50,310 --> 01:27:50,320
you know that uh deutsche technology is
 

3335
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:53,430
you know that uh deutsche technology is
best to take a look uh

3336
01:27:53,430 --> 01:27:53,440
best to take a look uh
 

3337
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:57,510
best to take a look uh
okay i'm here okay question was

3338
01:27:57,510 --> 01:27:57,520
okay i'm here okay question was
 

3339
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:59,590
okay i'm here okay question was
it so if you're feeling an upside down

3340
01:27:59,590 --> 01:27:59,600
it so if you're feeling an upside down
 

3341
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:00,709
it so if you're feeling an upside down
pyramid

3342
01:28:00,709 --> 01:28:00,719
pyramid
 

3343
01:28:00,719 --> 01:28:04,310
pyramid
um does is it like the tiny

3344
01:28:04,310 --> 01:28:04,320
um does is it like the tiny
 

3345
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:07,430
um does is it like the tiny
tip the one block tip of the pyramid

3346
01:28:07,430 --> 01:28:07,440
tip the one block tip of the pyramid
 

3347
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:10,950
tip the one block tip of the pyramid
yeah so or is this huge

3348
01:28:10,950 --> 01:28:10,960
yeah so or is this huge
 

3349
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:14,149
yeah so or is this huge
platform the the smallest uh tip

3350
01:28:14,149 --> 01:28:14,159
platform the the smallest uh tip
 

3351
01:28:14,159 --> 01:28:17,750
platform the the smallest uh tip
smallest uh whatever

3352
01:28:17,750 --> 01:28:17,760
smallest uh whatever
 

3353
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:22,470
smallest uh whatever
whatever okay so

3354
01:28:22,470 --> 01:28:22,480

 

3355
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:23,750

there this is this is the tip of the

3356
01:28:23,750 --> 01:28:23,760
there this is this is the tip of the
 

3357
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:29,350
there this is this is the tip of the
pyramid you see this

3358
01:28:29,350 --> 01:28:29,360
pyramid you see this
 

3359
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:32,870
pyramid you see this
okay so we'll build

3360
01:28:32,870 --> 01:28:32,880
okay so we'll build
 

3361
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:34,470
okay so we'll build
this is the perimeter of the tip and

3362
01:28:34,470 --> 01:28:34,480
this is the perimeter of the tip and
 

3363
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:36,390
this is the perimeter of the tip and
then we build like staircases

3364
01:28:36,390 --> 01:28:36,400
then we build like staircases
 

3365
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:39,189
then we build like staircases
up you understand like uh we should be

3366
01:28:39,189 --> 01:28:39,199
up you understand like uh we should be
 

3367
01:28:39,199 --> 01:28:40,790
up you understand like uh we should be
