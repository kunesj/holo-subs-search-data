then i'm like
 

4241
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:05,270
then i'm like
okay i guess like

4242
01:47:05,270 --> 01:47:05,280
okay i guess like
 

4243
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:06,870
okay i guess like
if they

4244
01:47:06,870 --> 01:47:06,880
if they
 

4245
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:08,149
if they
yeah yeah another thing i always

4246
01:47:08,149 --> 01:47:08,159
yeah yeah another thing i always
 

4247
01:47:08,159 --> 01:47:10,870
yeah yeah another thing i always
consider is like if they sleep before me

4248
01:47:10,870 --> 01:47:10,880
consider is like if they sleep before me
 

4249
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:12,709
consider is like if they sleep before me
then i feel like you know

4250
01:47:12,709 --> 01:47:12,719
then i feel like you know
 

4251
01:47:12,719 --> 01:47:15,109
then i feel like you know
they're gonna wake up before me probably

4252
01:47:15,109 --> 01:47:15,119
they're gonna wake up before me probably
 

4253
01:47:15,119 --> 01:47:17,430
they're gonna wake up before me probably
they're gonna get more sleep than me

4254
01:47:17,430 --> 01:47:17,440
they're gonna get more sleep than me
 

4255
01:47:17,440 --> 01:47:19,350
they're gonna get more sleep than me
and then i'll be super sleepy because i

4256
01:47:19,350 --> 01:47:19,360
and then i'll be super sleepy because i
 

4257
01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:21,270
and then i'll be super sleepy because i
have to kind of usually get up together

4258
01:47:21,270 --> 01:47:21,280
have to kind of usually get up together
 

4259
01:47:21,280 --> 01:47:24,790
have to kind of usually get up together
with whoever i'm staying with right

4260
01:47:24,790 --> 01:47:24,800
with whoever i'm staying with right
 

4261
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:26,870
with whoever i'm staying with right
so then i'll be lacking sleep if i stay

4262
01:47:26,870 --> 01:47:26,880
so then i'll be lacking sleep if i stay
 

4263
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:28,070
so then i'll be lacking sleep if i stay
up too long

4264
01:47:28,070 --> 01:47:28,080
up too long
 

4265
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:29,669
up too long
just because i have to get up at the

4266
01:47:29,669 --> 01:47:29,679
just because i have to get up at the

6773
02:51:13,600 --> 02:51:16,230

and then sometimes out of reflex

6774
02:51:16,230 --> 02:51:16,240
and then sometimes out of reflex
 

6775
02:51:16,240 --> 02:51:18,389
and then sometimes out of reflex
i would flush it anyway

6776
02:51:18,389 --> 02:51:18,399
i would flush it anyway
 

6777
02:51:18,399 --> 02:51:20,630
i would flush it anyway
and then i would be like [\h__\h] [\h__\h] [\h__\h]

6778
02:51:20,630 --> 02:51:20,640
and then i would be like [\h__\h] [\h__\h] [\h__\h]
 

6779
02:51:20,640 --> 02:51:24,309
and then i would be like [\h__\h] [\h__\h] [\h__\h]
it all happened too fast

6780
02:51:24,309 --> 02:51:24,319

 

6781
02:51:24,319 --> 02:51:25,110
