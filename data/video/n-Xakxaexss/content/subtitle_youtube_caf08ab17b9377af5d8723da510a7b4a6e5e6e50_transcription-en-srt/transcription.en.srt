the textbooks they always write

3548
01:57:52,070 --> 01:57:52,080
the textbooks they always write
 

3549
01:57:52,080 --> 01:57:55,209
the textbooks they always write
this but it's the same right

3550
01:57:55,209 --> 01:57:55,219
this but it's the same right
 

3551
01:57:55,219 --> 01:57:58,370
this but it's the same right
or because there's also

3552
01:57:58,370 --> 01:57:58,380
or because there's also
 

3553
01:57:58,380 --> 01:58:01,370

like this

3554
01:58:01,370 --> 01:58:01,380

5511
02:48:00,420 --> 02:48:02,590
ah Chloe's Chloe's free DMV is I think
from the same creator

5512
02:48:02,590 --> 02:48:02,600
from the same creator
 

5513
02:48:02,600 --> 02:48:06,849
from the same creator
yeah I think they could

5514
02:48:06,849 --> 02:48:06,859
yeah I think they could
 

5515
02:48:06,859 --> 02:48:11,630
yeah I think they could
probably do something like the K-pop mvs

5516
02:48:11,630 --> 02:48:11,640
probably do something like the K-pop mvs
 

5517
02:48:11,640 --> 02:48:14,990
probably do something like the K-pop mvs
that I have in mind

02:48:18,309 --> 02:48:18,319
but usually so far from my experience
 

5521
02:48:18,319 --> 02:48:21,770
but usually so far from my experience

um
 

5531
02:48:31,760 --> 02:48:36,770
um

5532
02:48:36,770 --> 02:48:36,780
maybe it's a case-by-case we'll see
 

5533

5535
02:48:39,720 --> 02:48:42,170
I'll see like choreographies as well
when I ask Japanese choreographers they

5536
02:48:42,170 --> 02:48:42,180
when I ask Japanese choreographers they
 

5537
02:48:42,180 --> 02:48:44,510
when I ask Japanese choreographers they
were more expensive way more way more

5538
