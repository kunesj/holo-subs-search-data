girls can probably see them in the

560
00:16:30,749 --> 00:16:30,759
girls can probably see them in the
 

561
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:33,230
girls can probably see them in the
settings uh on the on the computer here

562
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:33,240
settings uh on the on the computer here
 

563
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,550
settings uh on the on the computer here
there's a scientist who can access a

564
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:35,560
there's a scientist who can access a
 

565
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,670
there's a scientist who can access a
portable vitals panel so they can check

566
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:37,680
portable vitals panel so they can check
 

567
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,389
portable vitals panel so they can check
at any point of time if there's somebody

568
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:40,399
at any point of time if there's somebody
 

569
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,509
at any point of time if there's somebody
dead so they always see the status of

570
00:16:42,509 --> 00:16:42,519
dead so they always see the status of
 

571
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:45,670
dead so they always see the status of
the crew and then there's an engineer

572
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:45,680
the crew and then there's an engineer
 

573
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,309
the crew and then there's an engineer
who can use the vents even though

574
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:47,319
who can use the vents even though
 

575
00:16:47,319 --> 00:16:48,949
who can use the vents even though
they're not an impostor but then you

576
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:48,959
they're not an impostor but then you
 

577
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,910
they're not an impostor but then you
might be sused and you have to be like

578
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:50,920
might be sused and you have to be like
 

579
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,910
might be sused and you have to be like
I'm not the Imposter I just vent because

580
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:52,920
I'm not the Imposter I just vent because
 

581
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,949
I'm not the Imposter I just vent because
I can oh that's pretty

582
00:16:54,949 --> 00:16:54,959
I can oh that's pretty
 

583
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:58,069
I can oh that's pretty
cool and then the guardian angel uh is

584
00:16:58,069 --> 00:16:58,079
cool and then the guardian angel uh is
 

585
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,870
cool and then the guardian angel uh is
to go of the very first one of us that

586
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:01,880
to go of the very first one of us that
 

587
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,069
to go of the very first one of us that
dies oh is that how it works the first

588
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:04,079
dies oh is that how it works the first
 

589
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,750
dies oh is that how it works the first
person that dies oh yeah something like

590
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:05,760
person that dies oh yeah something like
 

591

00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:09,600
the first Dead crew mate they can
 

595
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,710
the first Dead crew mate they can
temporarily shield and protect other

596
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:11,720
temporarily shield and protect other
 

597
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,669
temporarily shield and protect other
living crew mates oh yeah so I guess if

598
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:13,679
living crew mates oh yeah so I guess if
 

599
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,189
living crew mates oh yeah so I guess if
you're the first one that dies you

600
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:15,199
you're the first one that dies you
 

601
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,069
you're the first one that dies you
become the guardian angel and then you

602
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:17,079
become the guardian angel and then you
 

603
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:19,549
become the guardian angel and then you
can protect somebody else so that they

604
00:17:19,549 --> 00:17:19,559
can protect somebody else so that they
 

605
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:23,590
can protect somebody else so that they
don't die yeah if you do it properly and

606
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:23,600
don't die yeah if you do it properly and
 

607
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,029
don't die yeah if you do it properly and
well timed you'll be able to prevent

608
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:25,039
well timed you'll be able to prevent
 

609
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,510
well timed you'll be able to prevent
imposters from killing their victims

610
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:26,520
imposters from killing their victims
 

611
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,310
imposters from killing their victims
sounds amazing me throwing so that I can

612
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:29,320
sounds amazing me throwing so that I can
 

613
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,950

to find too because then you know the
 

633
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,669
to find too because then you know the
Imposter can say I'm the engineer and oh

634
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:55,679
Imposter can say I'm the engineer and oh
 

635

you moved away from the the radio like

1588
00:44:30,109 --> 00:44:30,119
you moved away from the the radio like
 

1589
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:33,829
you moved away from the the radio like
where everyone was trying to fix it

1590
00:44:33,829 --> 00:44:33,839
where everyone was trying to fix it
 

1591
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:36,670
where everyone was trying to fix it
and well you needed to go do the other

1592
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:36,680
and well you needed to go do the other
 

1593
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,390
