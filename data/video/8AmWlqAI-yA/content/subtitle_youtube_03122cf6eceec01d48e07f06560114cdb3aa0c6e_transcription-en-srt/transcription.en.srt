favorable window around here anymore so
 

3923
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:36,790
favorable window around here anymore so

8674
03:56:52,070 --> 03:56:52,080
where the freak is the boss door i
 

8675
03:56:52,080 --> 03:57:05,189
where the freak is the boss door i
didn't see it yet

8677
03:57:05,199 --> 03:57:13,750

i see it i see the map but

8678
03:57:13,750 --> 03:57:13,760

 

8679
03:57:13,760 --> 03:57:16,870

i think

8680
03:57:16,870 --> 03:57:16,880

 

8681
03:57:16,880 --> 03:57:24,070

the map is confusing me a little bit

8682
03:57:24,070 --> 03:57:24,080

 

8683
03:57:24,080 --> 03:57:25,990

because it doesn't show in which rooms

8684
03:57:25,990 --> 03:57:26,000
because it doesn't show in which rooms
 

8685
03:57:26,000 --> 03:57:33,429
because it doesn't show in which rooms
you can go down to b1

8687
03:57:33,439 --> 03:57:35,349

i mean we can go down to b1 here

8688
03:57:35,349 --> 03:57:35,359
i mean we can go down to b1 here
 

8689
03:57:35,359 --> 03:57:41,429
i mean we can go down to b1 here
obviously but then

to one side
 

9827
04:30:28,880 --> 04:30:31,510
to one side
well maybe the other side

9828
04:30:31,510 --> 04:30:31,520
well maybe the other side
 

9829
04:30:31,520 --> 04:30:41,349
well maybe the other side
the right one that one goes faster

9830
04:30:41,349 --> 04:30:41,359

 

9831
04:30:41,359 --> 04:30:43,510

but now in theory there's more time to

9832
04:30:43,510 --> 04:30:43,520
but now in theory there's more time to
 

9833
04:30:43,520 --> 04:30:45,510
but now in theory there's more time to
walk through because it needs more time

9834
04:30:45,510 --> 04:30:45,520
walk through because it needs more time
 

9835
04:30:45,520 --> 04:30:52,950
walk through because it needs more time
to get to one side

9836
04:30:52,950 --> 04:30:52,960

 

9837
04:30:52,960 --> 04:30:54,149

14144
06:23:17,190 --> 06:23:17,200
about that but i'm just thinking um um
 

14145
06:23:17,200 --> 06:23:19,910
about that but i'm just thinking um um
one of the booths will surely comply

14146
06:23:19,910 --> 06:23:19,920
one of the booths will surely comply
 

14147
06:23:19,920 --> 06:23:22,628
one of the booths will surely comply
and then basically what you can do is if

14148
06:23:22,628 --> 06:23:22,638
and then basically what you can do is if
 

14149
06:23:22,638 --> 06:23:24,468
and then basically what you can do is if
you're an applicant then you know that

14150
06:23:24,468 --> 06:23:24,478
you're an applicant then you know that
 

14151

you applied so you know now that you're
 

14153
06:23:26,718 --> 06:23:29,590
you applied so you know now that you're
supposed to get a card so uh you can

14154
06:23:29,590 --> 06:23:29,600
