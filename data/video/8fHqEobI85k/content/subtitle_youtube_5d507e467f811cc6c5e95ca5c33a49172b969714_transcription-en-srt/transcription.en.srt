it's going to be very unlikely that
that's going to be relevant for us but

1362
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:24,200
that's going to be relevant for us but

time goes up as well why does it say
casual 1.5 oh because the speed of the

1372
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:37,480
casual 1.5 oh because the speed of the

whereas normal is 1.7 so it's going to
 

1377
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,510
whereas normal is 1.7 so it's going to
be a little bit slower than the normal

00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:43,520
be a little bit slower than the normal

01:56:51,320 --> 01:56:54,629
berries are we know that we have a
really bad Uh Wood situation all of that

4618
01:56:54,629 --> 01:56:54,639
really bad Uh Wood situation all of that
 

4619
01:56:54,639 --> 01:56:57,870
really bad Uh Wood situation all of that
we know where our opponent

4620
01:56:57,870 --> 01:56:57,880
we know where our opponent
 

4621
01:56:57,880 --> 01:57:01,550
we know where our opponent
is true like somewhere here I think

4622
01:57:01,550 --> 01:57:01,560
is true like somewhere here I think
 

4623
01:57:01,560 --> 01:57:04,870
is true like somewhere here I think
yeah somewhere there so we have a little

4624
01:57:04,870 --> 01:57:04,880
yeah somewhere there so we have a little
 

4625
01:57:04,880 --> 01:57:07,910
yeah somewhere there so we have a little
bit of an advantage now no no so the

4626
01:57:07,910 --> 01:57:07,920
bit of an advantage now no no so the
 

4627
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:11,390
bit of an advantage now no no so the
same modus operandi got the two houses

4628
01:57:11,390 --> 01:57:11,400
same modus operandi got the two houses
 

4629
01:57:11,400 --> 01:57:12,510
same modus operandi got the two houses
we can try to be a little bit more

4630
01:57:12,510 --> 01:57:12,520
we can try to be a little bit more
 

4631
01:57:12,520 --> 01:57:14,390
we can try to be a little bit more
efficient with the killing of the boar

4632
01:57:14,390 --> 01:57:14,400
efficient with the killing of the boar
 

4633
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:15,470
efficient with the killing of the boar
and

4634
01:57:15,470 --> 01:57:15,480
and
 

4635
01:57:15,480 --> 01:57:19,109
and
the yes good good good C villagers that

4636
01:57:19,109 --> 01:57:19,119
the yes good good good C villagers that
 

4637
01:57:19,119 --> 01:57:24,189
the yes good good good C villagers that
should be the first thing you do oh

4638
01:57:24,189 --> 01:57:24,199

 

4639
01:57:24,199 --> 01:57:26,950

okay so put one uh goat underneath the

4640
01:57:26,950 --> 01:57:26,960
okay so put one uh goat underneath the
 

4641
01:57:26,960 --> 01:57:28,470
okay so put one uh goat underneath the
town center and the other two further

4642
01:57:28,470 --> 01:57:28,480
town center and the other two further
 

4643
01:57:28,480 --> 01:57:30,790
town center and the other two further
away so they don't accidentally die and

4644
01:57:30,790 --> 01:57:30,800
away so they don't accidentally die and
 

4645
01:57:30,800 --> 01:57:35,669
away so they don't accidentally die and
now you can shift click oh yes perfect

4646
01:57:35,669 --> 01:57:35,679
now you can shift click oh yes perfect
 

4647
01:57:35,679 --> 01:57:37,870
now you can shift click oh yes perfect
all right all right all right okay let's

4648
01:57:37,870 --> 01:57:37,880
all right all right all right okay let's

goat Maybe go can you go to your options
right now actually I think you can

4658
01:57:52,350 --> 01:57:52,360
right now actually I think you can
 

4659
01:57:52,360 --> 01:57:55,069
right now actually I think you can
change your hotkeys right now yeah uh

4660
01:57:55,069 --> 01:57:55,079
change your hotkeys right now yeah uh
 

4661
01:57:55,079 --> 01:57:57,990
change your hotkeys right now yeah uh
yeah let's go to hotkeys um group

4662
01:57:57,990 --> 01:57:58,000
yeah let's go to hotkeys um group
 

4663
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:02,430
yeah let's go to hotkeys um group
commands because I think we can do the

4664
01:58:02,430 --> 01:58:02,440
commands because I think we can do the
 

4665
01:58:02,440 --> 01:58:05,149
commands because I think we can do the
um uh select all Stables because we're

4666
01:58:05,149 --> 01:58:05,159
um uh select all Stables because we're
 

4667
01:58:05,159 --> 01:58:06,589
um uh select all Stables because we're
going to want to go for the horsey

4668
01:58:06,589 --> 01:58:06,599
going to want to go for the horsey
 

4669
01:58:06,599 --> 01:58:10,390
going to want to go for the horsey
thingy uhuh so I think it would be what

4670
01:58:10,390 --> 01:58:10,400
thingy uhuh so I think it would be what
 

4671
01:58:10,400 --> 01:58:14,470
thingy uhuh so I think it would be what
would it be in game commands

4672
01:58:14,470 --> 01:58:14,480

 

4673
01:58:14,480 --> 01:58:17,870

maybe no unit commands let's just kind

4674
01:58:17,870 --> 01:58:17,880
maybe no unit commands let's just kind
 

4675
01:58:17,880 --> 01:58:20,030
maybe no unit commands let's just kind
of go down

4676
01:58:20,030 --> 01:58:20,040
of go down
 

4677
01:58:20,040 --> 01:58:23,149
of go down
stable so ah stable no this is just

4678
01:58:23,149 --> 01:58:23,159
stable so ah stable no this is just
 

4679
01:58:23,159 --> 01:58:25,229
stable so ah stable no this is just
making the thing we need we need the one

4680
01:58:25,229 --> 01:58:25,239
making the thing we need we need the one
 

4681
01:58:25,239 --> 01:58:27,950
making the thing we need we need the one
for the buildings uh it would be in

4682
01:58:27,950 --> 01:58:27,960
for the buildings uh it would be in
 

4683
01:58:27,960 --> 01:58:31,270
for the buildings uh it would be in
cycle commands I think cycle commands

4684
01:58:31,270 --> 01:58:31,280
cycle commands I think cycle commands
 

4685
01:58:31,280 --> 01:58:33,109
cycle commands I think cycle commands
and then we want to say yeah uh select

4686
01:58:33,109 --> 01:58:33,119
and then we want to say yeah uh select
 

4687
01:58:33,119 --> 01:58:35,189
and then we want to say yeah uh select
all

4688
01:58:35,189 --> 01:58:35,199
all
 

4689
01:58:35,199 --> 01:58:38,669
all
Stables it only has go to I think it's

4690
01:58:38,669 --> 01:58:38,679
Stables it only has go to I think it's
 

4691
01:58:38,679 --> 01:58:42,589
Stables it only has go to I think it's
further down oh it doesn't go lower it

4692
01:58:42,589 --> 01:58:42,599
further down oh it doesn't go lower it
 

4693
01:58:42,599 --> 01:58:44,109
further down oh it doesn't go lower it
doesn't go over there's no select all

4694
01:58:44,109 --> 01:58:44,119
doesn't go over there's no select all
 

4695
01:58:44,119 --> 01:58:47,310
doesn't go over there's no select all
Stables no just go to maybe go to all

4696
01:58:47,310 --> 01:58:47,320
Stables no just go to maybe go to all
 

4697
01:58:47,320 --> 01:58:50,069
Stables no just go to maybe go to all
Stables is that not one am I blind

stable just stable then it must be in
game commands if we scroll down a little

4710
01:59:05,430 --> 01:59:05,440
game commands if we scroll down a little
 

4711
01:59:05,440 --> 01:59:07,350
game commands if we scroll down a little
bit this is just going to make it easier

4712
01:59:07,350 --> 01:59:07,360
bit this is just going to make it easier

the mouse before you do it like

5768
02:24:55,230 --> 02:24:55,240
the mouse before you do it like
 

5769
02:24:55,240 --> 02:24:58,070
the mouse before you do it like
here um that's a little bit more risky

5770
02:24:58,070 --> 02:24:58,080
here um that's a little bit more risky
 

5771
02:24:58,080 --> 02:25:00,950
here um that's a little bit more risky
because they're going to be within range

5772
02:25:00,950 --> 02:25:00,960
because they're going to be within range
 

5773
02:25:00,960 --> 02:25:03,670
because they're going to be within range
of the building like while I'm building

5774
02:25:03,670 --> 02:25:03,680
of the building like while I'm building
 

5775
02:25:03,680 --> 02:25:05,670
of the building like while I'm building
it you mean you want to make it a little

5776
02:25:05,670 --> 02:25:05,680
it you mean you want to make it a little
 

5777
02:25:05,680 --> 02:25:07,990
it you mean you want to make it a little
bit behind so it has more chance of

5778
02:25:07,990 --> 02:25:08,000
bit behind so it has more chance of
 

5779
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:09,590
bit behind so it has more chance of
going up so if you take all of those

5780
02:25:09,590 --> 02:25:09,600
going up so if you take all of those
 

5781
02:25:09,600 --> 02:25:14,510
going up so if you take all of those

better at it just because I can't accept
 

8497
03:26:39,600 --> 03:26:43,030
better at it just because I can't accept
losing against stupid AI

8498
03:26:43,030 --> 03:26:43,040
losing against stupid AI
 

8499
03:26:43,040 --> 03:26:44,910
losing against stupid AI
and yeah and I want to be able to clear

8500
03:26:44,910 --> 03:26:44,920
and yeah and I want to be able to clear
 

8501
03:26:44,920 --> 03:26:46,870
and yeah and I want to be able to clear
all the campaigns and stuff cuz the

8502
03:26:46,870 --> 03:26:46,880
all the campaigns and stuff cuz the
 

8503
03:26:46,880 --> 03:26:48,750
all the campaigns and stuff cuz the
campaigns were actually like the first

8504
03:26:48,750 --> 03:26:48,760
campaigns were actually like the first
 

8505
03:26:48,760 --> 03:26:51,150
campaigns were actually like the first
thing I where I realized oh damn maybe

8506
03:26:51,150 --> 03:26:51,160
thing I where I realized oh damn maybe
 

8507
03:26:51,160 --> 03:26:53,950
thing I where I realized oh damn maybe
I'm not not made for Age of Empires but

8508
03:26:53,950 --> 03:26:53,960
I'm not not made for Age of Empires but
 

8509
03:26:53,960 --> 03:26:55,550
I'm not not made for Age of Empires but
then I realized the skirmishes are

8510
03:26:55,550 --> 03:26:55,560
then I realized the skirmishes are
 

8511
03:26:55,560 --> 03:26:59,349
then I realized the skirmishes are
actually way more like something I can

8512
03:26:59,349 --> 03:26:59,359
actually way more like something I can
 

8513
03:26:59,359 --> 03:27:03,030
actually way more like something I can
handle and somehow easier than the

8514
03:27:03,030 --> 03:27:03,040
handle and somehow easier than the
 

8515
03:27:03,040 --> 03:27:05,750
handle and somehow easier than the
campaigns mhm

8516
03:27:05,750 --> 03:27:05,760

a year and a half possibly longer wa but

8554
03:28:03,150 --> 03:28:03,160
a year and a half possibly longer wa but
 

8555
03:28:03,160 --> 03:28:05,590
a year and a half possibly longer wa but
like even even then I saw you like

8556
03:28:05,590 --> 03:28:05,600
like even even then I saw you like
 

8557
03:28:05,600 --> 03:28:07,950
like even even then I saw you like
micromanaging so it's like it how long

8558
03:28:07,950 --> 03:28:07,960
micromanaging so it's like it how long
 

8559
03:28:07,960 --> 03:28:09,590
micromanaging so it's like it how long
would you say it takes to get to like

8560
03:28:09,590 --> 03:28:09,600
would you say it takes to get to like
 

8561
03:28:09,600 --> 03:28:12,189
would you say it takes to get to like
your level

8562
03:28:12,189 --> 03:28:12,199
your level
 

8563
03:28:12,199 --> 03:28:14,269
your level
oh I mean that comes the more you play

8564
03:28:14,269 --> 03:28:14,279
oh I mean that comes the more you play
 

8565
03:28:14,279 --> 03:28:15,950
oh I mean that comes the more you play
like you can even see in the course of

8566
03:28:15,950 --> 03:28:15,960
like you can even see in the course of
 

8567
03:28:15,960 --> 03:28:18,189
like you can even see in the course of
this game uh your farm placement has

8568
03:28:18,189 --> 03:28:18,199
this game uh your farm placement has
 

8569
03:28:18,199 --> 03:28:20,070
this game uh your farm placement has
improved and your speed improved and

practicing micromanaging or like
 

8591
03:28:44,160 --> 03:28:47,150
practicing micromanaging or like
multitasking for 24 years right and

or
inside H that would be inside right the

11202
04:31:06,469 --> 04:31:06,479
inside H that would be inside right the
