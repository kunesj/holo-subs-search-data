113
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,830
everything
and i woke up so early even though i

114
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:51,840
and i woke up so early even though i
 

115
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,189
and i woke up so early even though i
didn't even have to

116
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:53,199
didn't even have to
 

117
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,390
didn't even have to
because first of all i hurt my neighbors

118
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:56,400
because first of all i hurt my neighbors
 

119
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,830
because first of all i hurt my neighbors
so so clearly even though they weren't

120
00:04:59,830 --> 00:04:59,840
so so clearly even though they weren't
 

121
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,909
so so clearly even though they weren't
even talking that loud

122
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:01,919
even talking that loud
 

123
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,710
even talking that loud
and because i had no curtains and i have

124
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:04,720
and because i had no curtains and i have
 

125
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,550
and because i had no curtains and i have
like a million windows

126
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:06,560
like a million windows
 

127
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,029
like a million windows
it was so bright and i don't know it's

128
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:09,039
it was so bright and i don't know it's
 

129
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:09,670
it was so bright and i don't know it's
just

130
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:09,680
just
 

131
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,710
just
i think that would have been the key to

132
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:12,720
i think that would have been the key to
 

133
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,110
i think that would have been the key to
fix my sleeping schedule if i would have

134
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:15,120
fix my sleeping schedule if i would have
 

135
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,390
fix my sleeping schedule if i would have
ever opened

136
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:16,400
ever opened
 

137
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,350
ever opened
the the curtains and just let the light

138
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:19,360
the the curtains and just let the light
 

139
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:19,830
the the curtains and just let the light
in

140
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:19,840
in
 

141
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,469
in
when it's supposed to be in there yeah i

142
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:22,479
when it's supposed to be in there yeah i
 

143
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:23,590
when it's supposed to be in there yeah i
think the lights

144
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:23,600
think the lights
 

145
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,790
think the lights
really woke me up um

146
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:26,800
really woke me up um
 

147
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,550
really woke me up um
we're in combination with my neighbors

148
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:28,560
we're in combination with my neighbors
 

149
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,310
we're in combination with my neighbors
though

150
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:30,320
though
 

151
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,990
though
so yeah but because of that i think they

152
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,000
so yeah but because of that i think they
 

153
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,749
so yeah but because of that i think they
definitely hear me because i heard them

154
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:33,759
definitely hear me because i heard them
 

155
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:34,390
definitely hear me because i heard them
in the morning

156
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:34,400
in the morning
 

157
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,310
in the morning
very clearly i heard like every word

158
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:36,320
very clearly i heard like every word
 

159
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,749
very clearly i heard like every word
they were saying but i wasn't sure if

160
00:05:37,749 --> 00:05:37,759
they were saying but i wasn't sure if
 

161
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:38,150
they were saying but i wasn't sure if
they

162
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:38,160
they
 

163
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,590
they
had a window open and maybe that's why i

164
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:41,600
had a window open and maybe that's why i
 

165
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,950
had a window open and maybe that's why i
heard them so clearly or they were

166
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:42,960
heard them so clearly or they were
 

167
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,270

on the switch would be even the safer
 

1119
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,349
on the switch would be even the safer
option because i guess the switch

1120
00:37:33,349 --> 00:37:33,359
option because i guess the switch
 

1121
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:35,990
option because i guess the switch
doesn't take any internet speed

1122

1127
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,910
playing but i feel like that might even
be the safer option

1128
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:41,920
