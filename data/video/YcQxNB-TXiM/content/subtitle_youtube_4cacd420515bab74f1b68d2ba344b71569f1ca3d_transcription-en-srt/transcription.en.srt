4833
02:21:07,120 --> 02:21:08,790
uh it wasn't so much the water flow but
the water flow was indeed broken the

02:21:08,790 --> 02:21:08,800
the water flow was indeed broken the
 

4835
02:21:08,800 --> 02:21:09,910
the water flow was indeed broken the
airflow

4836
02:21:09,910 --> 02:21:09,920

that by placing one torch you destroy

4856
02:21:31,030 --> 02:21:31,040
that by placing one torch you destroy
 

4857
02:21:31,040 --> 02:21:33,750
that by placing one torch you destroy
everything i wouldn't have known eva i'm

4861
02:21:35,760 --> 02:21:36,389
not mad at her at all this is totally
fine but

4862
02:21:36,389 --> 02:21:36,399
fine but
 

4863
02:21:36,399 --> 02:21:39,190
fine but
she was like that's the moment when she

4864
02:21:39,190 --> 02:21:39,200
she was like that's the moment when she
 

4865
02:21:39,200 --> 02:21:43,670
she was like that's the moment when she
realized oh that must have been me

4866
02:21:43,670 --> 02:21:43,680

 

4867
02:21:43,680 --> 02:21:45,510

and then she just panicked and i was

4868
02:21:45,510 --> 02:21:45,520
and then she just panicked and i was
 

4869
02:21:45,520 --> 02:21:47,590
and then she just panicked and i was
like kiana you're so amazing you're

4870
02:21:47,590 --> 02:21:47,600
like kiana you're so amazing you're
 

4871
02:21:47,600 --> 02:21:49,110
like kiana you're so amazing you're
great another why did you not open the

4872
02:21:49,110 --> 02:21:49,120
great another why did you not open the
 

4873
02:21:49,120 --> 02:21:51,990
great another why did you not open the
trapdoor uh it was not possible i think

4874
02:21:51,990 --> 02:21:52,000
trapdoor uh it was not possible i think
 

4875
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:55,190
trapdoor uh it was not possible i think
that's literally the isn't that

4876
02:21:55,190 --> 02:21:55,200
that's literally the isn't that
 

4877
02:21:55,200 --> 02:21:56,469
that's literally the isn't that
isn't that literally the one

4878
02:21:56,469 --> 02:21:56,479
isn't that literally the one
 

4879
02:21:56,479 --> 02:21:58,550
isn't that literally the one
functionality of trapdoors that if

4880
02:21:58,550 --> 02:21:58,560
functionality of trapdoors that if
 

4881
02:21:58,560 --> 02:22:00,070
functionality of trapdoors that if
you're behind them

4882
02:22:00,070 --> 02:22:00,080
you're behind them
 

4883
02:22:00,080 --> 02:22:06,150
you're behind them
you're trapped doesn't that make sense

4884
02:22:06,150 --> 02:22:06,160

 

4885
02:22:06,160 --> 02:22:08,230

the reason why they were trapdoors door

4886
02:22:08,230 --> 02:22:08,240
the reason why they were trapdoors door
 

4887
02:22:08,240 --> 02:22:09,990
the reason why they were trapdoors door
there to begin with they were never

4888
02:22:09,990 --> 02:22:10,000
there to begin with they were never
 

4889
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:11,510
there to begin with they were never
supposed to be closed they were they

4890
02:22:11,510 --> 02:22:11,520
supposed to be closed they were they
 

4891
02:22:11,520 --> 02:22:12,469
supposed to be closed they were they
were just there

4892
02:22:12,469 --> 02:22:12,479
were just there
 

4893
02:22:12,479 --> 02:22:16,230
were just there
to stop the water from uh overflowing

4894
02:22:16,230 --> 02:22:16,240
to stop the water from uh overflowing
 

4895
02:22:16,240 --> 02:22:17,910
to stop the water from uh overflowing
you could put something else there too

4896
02:22:17,910 --> 02:22:17,920
you could put something else there too
 

4897
02:22:17,920 --> 02:22:19,750
you could put something else there too
but at the moment i only had trapdoors

4898
02:22:19,750 --> 02:22:19,760
but at the moment i only had trapdoors
 

4899
02:22:19,760 --> 02:22:21,590
but at the moment i only had trapdoors
so i put trapdoors there

4900
02:22:21,590 --> 02:22:21,600
so i put trapdoors there
 

4901
02:22:21,600 --> 02:22:23,910
so i put trapdoors there
i didn't think that you know they

4902
02:22:23,910 --> 02:22:23,920
i didn't think that you know they
 

4903
02:22:23,920 --> 02:22:25,429
i didn't think that you know they
someone would just

4904
02:22:25,429 --> 02:22:25,439
someone would just
 

4905
02:22:25,439 --> 02:22:27,429
someone would just
put them down and then you would be

4906
02:22:27,429 --> 02:22:27,439
put them down and then you would be
 

4907
02:22:27,439 --> 02:22:29,670
put them down and then you would be
stuck there no i wasn't able to open it

4908
02:22:29,670 --> 02:22:29,680
stuck there no i wasn't able to open it
 

4909
02:22:29,680 --> 02:22:31,349
stuck there no i wasn't able to open it
for some reason i couldn't destroy the

4910
02:22:31,349 --> 02:22:31,359
for some reason i couldn't destroy the
 

4911
02:22:31,359 --> 02:22:32,389
for some reason i couldn't destroy the
blocks either

4912
02:22:32,389 --> 02:22:32,399
blocks either
 

4913
02:22:32,399 --> 02:22:35,349
blocks either
because i was in the water i think when

4914
02:22:35,349 --> 02:22:35,359
because i was in the water i think when
 

4915
02:22:35,359 --> 02:22:37,349
because i was in the water i think when
you're in the water then you know

4916
02:22:37,349 --> 02:22:37,359
you're in the water then you know
 

4917
02:22:37,359 --> 02:22:39,910
you're in the water then you know
things are way more difficult to break

4918
02:22:39,910 --> 02:22:39,920
things are way more difficult to break
 

4919
02:22:39,920 --> 02:22:40,790
things are way more difficult to break
so that was an

4920
02:22:40,790 --> 02:22:40,800
so that was an
 

4921
02:22:40,800 --> 02:22:44,150
so that was an
issue it's all good though i got my

4922
02:22:44,150 --> 02:22:44,160
issue it's all good though i got my
 

4923
02:22:44,160 --> 02:22:46,230
issue it's all good though i got my
stuff back i think

4924
02:22:46,230 --> 02:22:46,240
stuff back i think
 

4925
02:22:46,240 --> 02:22:48,870
stuff back i think
i think i got all my stuff like but i

4926
02:22:48,870 --> 02:22:48,880
i think i got all my stuff like but i
 

4927
02:22:48,880 --> 02:22:49,429
i think i got all my stuff like but i
think

4928
02:22:49,429 --> 02:22:49,439
think
 

4929
02:22:49,439 --> 02:22:52,550
think
gooda still has something for me but i

4930
02:22:52,550 --> 02:22:52,560
gooda still has something for me but i
 

4931
02:22:52,560 --> 02:22:53,750
gooda still has something for me but i
don't care it's okay she can keep

4932
02:22:53,750 --> 02:22:53,760
don't care it's okay she can keep
 

4933
02:22:53,760 --> 02:22:55,429

02:22:55,439 --> 02:22:57,670
whatever she has
it probably wasn't such a important

4936
02:22:57,670 --> 02:22:57,680
it probably wasn't such a important
 

4937
02:22:57,680 --> 02:23:00,230
it probably wasn't such a important
thing anyway

4938
02:23:00,230 --> 02:23:00,240
thing anyway
 

4939
02:23:00,240 --> 02:23:02,790
thing anyway
yeah what makes breaking stuff much much

4940
02:23:02,790 --> 02:23:02,800
yeah what makes breaking stuff much much
 

4941
02:23:02,800 --> 02:23:09,110
yeah what makes breaking stuff much much
much much much slower on you

4942
02:23:09,110 --> 02:23:09,120

 

4943
02:23:09,120 --> 02:23:12,150

i don't know i couldn't get through eh

4944
02:23:12,150 --> 02:23:12,160
i don't know i couldn't get through eh
 

4945
