Joy I for God joystick joystick yeah cuz

250
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:02,120
Joy I for God joystick joystick yeah cuz
 

251
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,990
Joy I for God joystick joystick yeah cuz
the joystick can't really pick up those

252
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:05,000
the joystick can't really pick up those
 

253
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,509
the joystick can't really pick up those
movements so well when you're in such a

254
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:07,519
movements so well when you're in such a
 

255
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,829
movements so well when you're in such a
highpe speed range and you need to have

256
00:11:10,829 --> 00:11:10,839
highpe speed range and you need to have
 

257
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:14,990
highpe speed range and you need to have
more sensitive motions right so I

258
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:15,000
more sensitive motions right so I
 

259
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,910
more sensitive motions right so I
thought oh that makes a lot of sense

260
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:16,920
thought oh that makes a lot of sense
 

261
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,750

01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:31,789
was I was by the way considering doing a
a wheel camera but I ran out of time

2182
01:07:31,789 --> 01:07:31,799
a wheel camera but I ran out of time
 

2183
01:07:31,799 --> 01:07:35,190
a wheel camera but I ran out of time

2190
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:46,760
don't know if I really want to do that
 

2191
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:49,870
don't know if I really want to do that
if I should do that because I'm really

2192
01:07:49,870 --> 01:07:49,880
if I should do that because I'm really
 

2193
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:52,390
if I should do that because I'm really
close to the wheel I'm like kind of

2194
01:07:52,390 --> 01:07:52,400
close to the wheel I'm like kind of
 

2195
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:55,950
close to the wheel I'm like kind of
hugging it I'm almost leaning on it

2196
01:07:55,950 --> 01:07:55,960
hugging it I'm almost leaning on it
 

2197
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:58,269
hugging it I'm almost leaning on it

behind I mean I guess more the longer it
 

5777
02:58:33,760 --> 02:58:35,550
behind I mean I guess more the longer it
is the more chances are for the others

5778
02:58:35,550 --> 02:58:35,560
is the more chances are for the others
 

5779
02:58:35,560 --> 02:58:37,750
is the more chances are for the others
to also make more mistakes later on but

5780
02:58:37,750 --> 02:58:37,760
to also make more mistakes later on but
 

5781
02:58:37,760 --> 02:58:40,870
to also make more mistakes later on but
I feel like the ones who will be leading

5782

I feel like the ones who will be leading
 

5783
02:58:40,880 --> 02:58:42,349

6258
03:10:59,630 --> 03:10:59,640

 

6259
03:10:59,640 --> 03:11:02,190

6265
03:11:08,520 --> 03:11:11,590
imagine but I'd like them to tell me
that feels weird when you know I put all

6266
03:11:11,590 --> 03:11:11,600
that feels weird when you know I put all
 

6267
03:11:11,600 --> 03:11:14,269
that feels weird when you know I put all
my all my effort into figuring out these

6268
03:11:14,269 --> 03:11:14,279
my all my effort into figuring out these
 

6269
03:11:14,279 --> 03:11:16,950
my all my effort into figuring out these
things on my own because it just doesn't

6270
03:11:16,950 --> 03:11:16,960
things on my own because it just doesn't
 

6271
03:11:16,960 --> 03:11:19,990
things on my own because it just doesn't
work with our own app so I I figure out

6272
03:11:19,990 --> 03:11:20,000
work with our own app so I I figure out
 

6273
03:11:20,000 --> 03:11:24,550
work with our own app so I I figure out
how to uh use other apps how to operate

6274
03:11:24,550 --> 03:11:24,560
how to uh use other apps how to operate
 

6275
03:11:24,560 --> 03:11:26,269
how to uh use other apps how to operate
them and everything cuz it's kind of

6276
03:11:26,269 --> 03:11:26,279
them and everything cuz it's kind of
 

6277
03:11:26,279 --> 03:11:28,349
them and everything cuz it's kind of
complicated and so on and now they want

6278
03:11:28,349 --> 03:11:28,359
complicated and so on and now they want
 

6279
03:11:28,359 --> 03:11:33,660
complicated and so on and now they want
to know all the details from

6280
03:11:33,660 --> 03:11:33,670

 

6281
03:11:33,670 --> 03:11:35,910

03:36:35,239 --> 03:36:38,070
her and visit when you can H why does it
always have to be me she promised to

7180
03:36:38,070 --> 03:36:38,080
always have to be me she promised to
 

7181
03:36:38,080 --> 03:36:40,070
always have to be me she promised to
visit me maybe you can even do the males

7182
03:36:40,070 --> 03:36:40,080
visit me maybe you can even do the males
 

7183
03:36:40,080 --> 03:36:42,269
visit me maybe you can even do the males
with her one year or invite her to Japan

7184
03:36:42,269 --> 03:36:42,279
with her one year or invite her to Japan
 

7185
03:36:42,279 --> 03:36:44,150
with her one year or invite her to Japan
oh I think males is very

7186
03:36:44,150 --> 03:36:44,160
oh I think males is very
 

7187
03:36:44,160 --> 03:36:46,349
oh I think males is very
unlikely and since this is probably the

7188
03:36:46,349 --> 03:36:46,359
unlikely and since this is probably the
 

7189
03:36:46,359 --> 03:36:47,870
unlikely and since this is probably the
last time I can say this you still need

7190
03:36:47,870 --> 03:36:47,880
last time I can say this you still need
 

7191
03:36:47,880 --> 03:36:50,870
last time I can say this you still need
to take her IE skating it's not the last

7192
03:36:50,870 --> 03:36:50,880
to take her IE skating it's not the last
 

7193
03:36:50,880 --> 03:36:54,429
to take her IE skating it's not the last
time you can say it but if she visits

7194
03:36:54,429 --> 03:36:54,439
time you can say it but if she visits
 

7195
03:36:54,439 --> 03:36:57,349
time you can say it but if she visits
Austria I can take R skating especially

7196
03:36:57,349 --> 03:36:57,359
Austria I can take R skating especially
 

7197
03:36:57,359 --> 03:36:58,790
Austria I can take R skating especially
in the winter but I guess it doesn't

7198
03:36:58,790 --> 03:36:58,800
in the winter but I guess it doesn't
 

7199
03:36:58,800 --> 03:36:59,830
in the winter but I guess it doesn't
have to be

7200
03:36:59,830 --> 03:36:59,840
have to be
 

7201
03:36:59,840 --> 03:37:02,189

things I wanted to do in terms of 3D

7230
03:37:38,229 --> 03:37:38,239
things I wanted to do in terms of 3D
 

7231
03:37:38,239 --> 03:37:40,030
things I wanted to do in terms of 3D
even though it was always quite

even though it was always quite
 

7233
03:37:40,040 --> 03:37:43,750

would have been such a big thing so

7320
03:39:35,670 --> 03:39:35,680
would have been such a big thing so
 

7321
03:39:35,680 --> 03:39:37,110
would have been such a big thing so
early on at

7322
03:39:37,110 --> 03:39:37,120
early on at
 

7323
03:39:37,120 --> 03:39:41,309
early on at
least would have would have taken

7324
03:39:41,309 --> 03:39:41,319
least would have would have taken
 

7325
03:39:41,319 --> 03:39:43,910
least would have would have taken
longer and it might have just been stuff

7326
03:39:43,910 --> 03:39:43,920
longer and it might have just been stuff
 

7327
03:39:43,920 --> 03:39:48,110
longer and it might have just been stuff
like m later on but yeah we had quite a

7328
03:39:48,110 --> 03:39:48,120
like m later on but yeah we had quite a
 

7329
03:39:48,120 --> 03:39:50,630
like m later on but yeah we had quite a
few different things on our

7330
03:39:50,630 --> 03:39:50,640
few different things on our
 

7331
03:39:50,640 --> 03:39:53,429
few different things on our
radar yeah

7332
03:39:53,429 --> 03:39:53,439
radar yeah
 

7333
03:39:53,439 --> 03:39:55,229

so

7334
03:39:55,229 --> 03:39:55,239
so
 

7335
03:39:55,239 --> 03:39:57,189
so
yeah things would have been very

7336
03:39:57,189 --> 03:39:57,199
yeah things would have been very
 

7337
03:39:57,199 --> 03:40:01,110
yeah things would have been very
different without Amy very

7338
03:40:01,110 --> 03:40:01,120
different without Amy very
 

7339
03:40:01,120 --> 03:40:03,070
different without Amy very
different who knows if we would have

7340
03:40:03,070 --> 03:40:03,080
different who knows if we would have
 

7341
03:40:03,080 --> 03:40:06,349
different who knows if we would have
ever done anything in the VR world like

7342
03:40:06,349 --> 03:40:06,359
ever done anything in the VR world like
 

7343
