02:21:31,190 --> 02:21:31,200
it's really just the distance it makes a
 

4865
02:21:31,200 --> 02:21:32,809
it's really just the distance it makes a
huge difference to

4866
02:21:32,809 --> 02:21:32,819
huge difference to
 

4867
02:21:32,819 --> 02:21:37,910
huge difference to
be there together in person

and like also you know you know uh
how in America you know when we did like

4974
02:24:27,349 --> 02:24:27,359
how in America you know when we did like
 

4975
02:24:27,359 --> 02:24:30,110
how in America you know when we did like
the Pop-Tart stream for example when I

4976
02:24:30,110 --> 02:24:30,120
the Pop-Tart stream for example when I
 

4977
02:24:30,120 --> 02:24:31,969
the Pop-Tart stream for example when I
was sitting next to gouda during her

4978
02:24:31,969 --> 02:24:31,979
was sitting next to gouda during her
 

4979
02:24:31,979 --> 02:24:34,190
was sitting next to gouda during her
stream

4980
02:24:34,190 --> 02:24:34,200
stream
 

4981
02:24:34,200 --> 02:24:35,929
stream
um you know back then I feel like it was

4982
02:24:35,929 --> 02:24:35,939
um you know back then I feel like it was
 

4983
02:24:35,939 --> 02:24:37,730
um you know back then I feel like it was
still kind of awkward to stream together

4984
02:24:37,730 --> 02:24:37,740
still kind of awkward to stream together
 

4985
02:24:37,740 --> 02:24:39,710
still kind of awkward to stream together
as an off collab

4986
02:24:39,710 --> 02:24:39,720
as an off collab
 

4987
02:24:39,720 --> 02:24:41,510
as an off collab
but like

4988
02:24:41,510 --> 02:24:41,520
but like
 

4989
02:24:41,520 --> 02:24:43,490
but like
you know it would be awkward because

4990
02:24:43,490 --> 02:24:43,500
you know it would be awkward because
 

4991
02:24:43,500 --> 02:24:44,510
you know it would be awkward because
like

4992
02:24:44,510 --> 02:24:44,520
like
 

4993
02:24:44,520 --> 02:24:45,950
like
looking at each other and stuff like

4994
02:24:45,950 --> 02:24:45,960
looking at each other and stuff like
 

4995
02:24:45,960 --> 02:24:47,570
looking at each other and stuff like
that this could just come out awkward I

4996
02:24:47,570 --> 02:24:47,580
that this could just come out awkward I
 

4997
02:24:47,580 --> 02:24:48,889
that this could just come out awkward I
don't know but this time for example

4998
02:24:48,889 --> 02:24:48,899
don't know but this time for example
 

4999
02:24:48,899 --> 02:24:52,130
don't know but this time for example
when I did that stream of Buddha

5000
02:24:52,130 --> 02:24:52,140
when I did that stream of Buddha
 

5001
02:24:52,140 --> 02:24:55,610
when I did that stream of Buddha
or also the the cube stream with uh Cali

5002
02:24:55,610 --> 02:24:55,620
or also the the cube stream with uh Cali
 

5003
02:24:55,620 --> 02:24:59,150
or also the the cube stream with uh Cali
for example or the the watch along of

5004
02:24:59,150 --> 02:24:59,160
for example or the the watch along of
 

5005
02:24:59,160 --> 02:25:01,130
for example or the the watch along of
the Nintendo Direct with Inya and so on

5006
02:25:01,130 --> 02:25:01,140
the Nintendo Direct with Inya and so on
 

5007
02:25:01,140 --> 02:25:02,870
the Nintendo Direct with Inya and so on
all these things

5008
02:25:02,870 --> 02:25:02,880
all these things
 

5009
02:25:02,880 --> 02:25:05,510
all these things
like you know we would look at each

5010
02:25:05,510 --> 02:25:05,520
like you know we would look at each
 

5011
02:25:05,520 --> 02:25:07,550
like you know we would look at each
other a lot while doing it

5012
02:25:07,550 --> 02:25:07,560
other a lot while doing it
 

5013
02:25:07,560 --> 02:25:09,770
other a lot while doing it
I'm especially surprised to know how

5014
02:25:09,770 --> 02:25:09,780
I'm especially surprised to know how
 

5015
02:25:09,780 --> 02:25:12,010
I'm especially surprised to know how
comfortable gouda was with that

5016
02:25:12,010 --> 02:25:12,020
comfortable gouda was with that
 

5017
02:25:12,020 --> 02:25:15,650
comfortable gouda was with that
we were actually a lot of the silent

5018
02:25:15,650 --> 02:25:15,660
we were actually a lot of the silent
 

5019
02:25:15,660 --> 02:25:20,389
we were actually a lot of the silent
moments of the one to switch collab

5020
02:25:20,389 --> 02:25:20,399

 

5021
02:25:20,399 --> 02:25:21,770

um I guess they didn't really translate

5022
02:25:21,770 --> 02:25:21,780
um I guess they didn't really translate
 

5023
02:25:21,780 --> 02:25:23,450
um I guess they didn't really translate
well on stream because you guys don't

5024
02:25:23,450 --> 02:25:23,460
well on stream because you guys don't
 

5025
02:25:23,460 --> 02:25:24,830
well on stream because you guys don't
know what kind of looks we were giving

5026
02:25:24,830 --> 02:25:24,840
know what kind of looks we were giving
 

5027
02:25:24,840 --> 02:25:27,530

yeah ID even had themselves as guests
 

8821
04:04:18,359 --> 04:04:20,030
yeah ID even had themselves as guests
which I found interesting because like

8822
04:04:20,030 --> 04:04:20,040
which I found interesting because like
 

8823
04:04:20,040 --> 04:04:23,210
which I found interesting because like
for for example the Cali thing

8824
04:04:23,210 --> 04:04:23,220
for for example the Cali thing
 

8825
04:04:23,220 --> 04:04:26,510
for for example the Cali thing
the stages were like floating ghosts

8826
04:04:26,510 --> 04:04:26,520
the stages were like floating ghosts
 

8827
04:04:26,520 --> 04:04:29,090

it didn't seem like an option to have

8828
04:04:29,090 --> 04:04:29,100
it didn't seem like an option to have
 

8829
04:04:29,100 --> 04:04:32,210
it didn't seem like an option to have
them there in proper 3D so I guess

8830
04:04:32,210 --> 04:04:32,220
them there in proper 3D so I guess
 

8831
04:04:32,220 --> 04:04:34,969
them there in proper 3D so I guess
that's just like a branch thing where ID

8832

that's just like a branch thing where ID
 

8833

why
 

8841
04:04:43,800 --> 04:04:45,650
why
because like for

8842
04:04:45,650 --> 04:04:45,660
because like for
 

8843
04:04:45,660 --> 04:04:47,990
because like for
for Cali for example you know Ina was

8844
04:04:47,990 --> 04:04:48,000
for Cali for example you know Ina was
 

8845
04:04:48,000 --> 04:04:49,490
for Cali for example you know Ina was
there but like you know already debuted

8846
04:04:49,490 --> 04:04:49,500
there but like you know already debuted
 

8847
04:04:49,500 --> 04:04:50,750
there but like you know already debuted
at that point so if you think about it

8848
04:04:50,750 --> 04:04:50,760
at that point so if you think about it
 

8849
04:04:50,760 --> 04:04:52,250
at that point so if you think about it
you could have already shown Ina and

8850
04:04:52,250 --> 04:04:52,260
you could have already shown Ina and
 

8851
04:04:52,260 --> 04:04:55,790
you could have already shown Ina and

9082
04:12:06,950 --> 04:12:06,960
so
 

9083
04:12:06,960 --> 04:12:08,870
so
um like for example for the the good

9084
04:12:08,870 --> 04:12:08,880
um like for example for the the good
 

9085
04:12:08,880 --> 04:12:11,450
um like for example for the the good
thing about pre-recording it and why I

9086
04:12:11,450 --> 04:12:11,460
thing about pre-recording it and why I
 

9087
04:12:11,460 --> 04:12:13,969
thing about pre-recording it and why I
like it too much and will probably

9088
04:12:13,969 --> 04:12:13,979
like it too much and will probably
 

9089
04:12:13,979 --> 04:12:15,530
like it too much and will probably
continue to have things more

9090
04:12:15,530 --> 04:12:15,540
continue to have things more
 

9091
04:12:15,540 --> 04:12:17,870

pre-recorded is because for example for

9092
04:12:17,870 --> 04:12:17,880
pre-recorded is because for example for
 

9093
04:12:17,880 --> 04:12:20,510

9094
04:12:20,510 --> 04:12:20,520
the energy one
 

9095
04:12:20,520 --> 04:12:22,429

um you know

9096
04:12:22,429 --> 04:12:22,439
um you know
 

9097
04:12:22,439 --> 04:12:25,849

9099
04:12:25,859 --> 04:12:28,010

of the camera work
 

9101
04:12:28,020 --> 04:12:32,389
of the camera work
and I was able to change angles

9102
04:12:32,389 --> 04:12:32,399
and I was able to change angles
 

9103
04:12:32,399 --> 04:12:35,330
and I was able to change angles
so I said for example for the dance

9104
04:12:35,330 --> 04:12:35,340
so I said for example for the dance
 

9105
04:12:35,340 --> 04:12:37,610
so I said for example for the dance
break it was on a close-up and I was

9106
04:12:37,610 --> 04:12:37,620
break it was on a close-up and I was
 

9107
04:12:37,620 --> 04:12:39,290
break it was on a close-up and I was
like can you please change that to like

9108
04:12:39,290 --> 04:12:39,300
like can you please change that to like
 

9109
04:12:39,300 --> 04:12:41,990
like can you please change that to like
a full body angle where you can see both

9110
04:12:41,990 --> 04:12:42,000
a full body angle where you can see both
 

9111
04:12:42,000 --> 04:12:44,570

of us dancing in sync and they changed

9112
04:12:44,570 --> 04:12:44,580

9113
04:12:44,580 --> 04:12:46,070

it

9114
04:12:46,070 --> 04:12:46,080
it
 

9115
04:12:46,080 --> 04:12:47,750
it
yeah

9116
04:12:47,750 --> 04:12:47,760
yeah
 

9117
04:12:47,760 --> 04:12:49,429
yeah
so stuff like that

9118
04:12:49,429 --> 04:12:49,439
so stuff like that
 

9119
04:12:49,439 --> 04:12:51,290
so stuff like that
can be changed and other times when

9120
04:12:51,290 --> 04:12:51,300
can be changed and other times when
 

9121
04:12:51,300 --> 04:12:54,050
can be changed and other times when
maybe I did a mistake I can hide it

9122
04:12:54,050 --> 04:12:54,060
maybe I did a mistake I can hide it
 

9123
04:12:54,060 --> 04:12:56,990
maybe I did a mistake I can hide it
by changing the angle

9124
04:12:56,990 --> 04:12:57,000
by changing the angle
 

9125
04:12:57,000 --> 04:12:59,809
by changing the angle
and that way I can also ensure that you

9126
04:12:59,809 --> 04:12:59,819
and that way I can also ensure that you
 

9127

know it's a better viewing experience

know it's a better viewing experience
 

9129
04:13:01,319 --> 04:13:03,290
know it's a better viewing experience
because if it's live so many things can

9130

especially in an environment where

9134

everything's so technical well when you

04:13:12,120 --> 04:13:15,530
everything's so technical well when you

9138
04:13:15,530 --> 04:13:15,540

9141
04:13:17,460 --> 04:13:20,150

much more than can go wrong then

9142
04:13:20,150 --> 04:13:20,160
much more than can go wrong then
 

9143
04:13:20,160 --> 04:13:22,429

for a real performer like a real human

9144
