00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:35,269
and or a youtube or whatever uh
and just not put so much work into it

330
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:35,279
and just not put so much work into it
 

331
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,149
and just not put so much work into it
but you can also

332
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:36,159
but you can also
 

333
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,070
but you can also
put a lot of work into it and i would

334
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:38,080
put a lot of work into it and i would
 

335
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,509
put a lot of work into it and i would
say for example someone like

4281
01:35:58,159 --> 01:36:00,550
places and
um learn more and looking looking for

other phoenix's you know

4284
01:36:02,390 --> 01:36:02,400
other phoenix's you know
 

4285
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:05,030
other phoenix's you know
because uh most dimensions i ended up in

4286
01:36:05,030 --> 01:36:05,040
because uh most dimensions i ended up in
 

4287
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:06,629
because uh most dimensions i ended up in
didn't have any other phoenix's and i

4288
01:36:06,629 --> 01:36:06,639
didn't have any other phoenix's and i
 

4289
01:36:06,639 --> 01:36:07,030
didn't have any other phoenix's and i
was

4290
01:36:07,030 --> 01:36:07,040

4291
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:08,950
was
usually the only one but sometimes i met

4292
01:36:08,950 --> 01:36:08,960
usually the only one but sometimes i met
 

4293
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:10,229
usually the only one but sometimes i met
other phoenixes

4294
01:36:10,229 --> 01:36:10,239
other phoenixes
 

4295
01:36:10,239 --> 01:36:14,070
other phoenixes
anyway yeah

4296
01:36:14,070 --> 01:36:14,080
anyway yeah
 

4297
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:16,629
anyway yeah
so i'm probably not the right person to

4298
01:36:16,629 --> 01:36:16,639
so i'm probably not the right person to
 

4299
01:36:16,639 --> 01:36:18,229
so i'm probably not the right person to
ask this question

4300
01:36:18,229 --> 01:36:18,239
ask this question
 

4301
01:36:18,239 --> 01:36:21,350
ask this question
i i'm not sure what advice to give you

4302
01:36:21,350 --> 01:36:21,360
i i'm not sure what advice to give you
 

4303
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:27,430
i i'm not sure what advice to give you
but and if i put myself in your shoes

4304
01:36:27,430 --> 01:36:27,440
but and if i put myself in your shoes
 

4305
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:29,109
but and if i put myself in your shoes
as an immortal i would probably be

4306
01:36:29,109 --> 01:36:29,119
as an immortal i would probably be
 

4307
01:36:29,119 --> 01:36:31,350
as an immortal i would probably be
scared

4308
01:36:31,350 --> 01:36:31,360
scared
 

4309
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:33,189
scared
and but i would probably just try to not

4310
01:36:33,189 --> 01:36:33,199
and but i would probably just try to not
 

4311
01:36:33,199 --> 01:36:34,790
and but i would probably just try to not
think about it as long as i can

4312
01:36:34,790 --> 01:36:34,800
think about it as long as i can
 

4313
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:36,709
think about it as long as i can
and i think that's just how most people

4314
01:36:36,709 --> 01:36:36,719
and i think that's just how most people
 

4315
01:36:36,719 --> 01:36:38,629
and i think that's just how most people
live their life i guess

4316
01:36:38,629 --> 01:36:38,639
live their life i guess
 

4317
01:36:38,639 --> 01:36:43,189
live their life i guess
right just not think about it

4318
01:36:43,189 --> 01:36:43,199
right just not think about it
 

4319
01:36:43,199 --> 01:36:46,870
right just not think about it
until you get confronted with it

4320
01:36:46,870 --> 01:36:46,880
until you get confronted with it
 

4321
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:49,910
until you get confronted with it
and i think i guess that's just okay i

4322
01:36:49,910 --> 01:36:49,920
and i think i guess that's just okay i
 

4323
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:54,550
and i think i guess that's just okay i
guess that's okay

4324

that would be cool somehow if we could

4730
01:47:22,229 --> 01:47:22,239
that would be cool somehow if we could
 

4731
01:47:22,239 --> 01:47:23,669
that would be cool somehow if we could
implement something like that

4732
01:47:23,669 --> 01:47:23,679
implement something like that
 

4733
01:47:23,679 --> 01:47:28,629
implement something like that
but if i ever get to get to do a 3dw

4734
01:47:28,629 --> 01:47:28,639
but if i ever get to get to do a 3dw
 

4735
01:47:28,639 --> 01:47:32,310
but if i ever get to get to do a 3dw
i think for the 3dw we wouldn't

4736
01:47:32,310 --> 01:47:32,320
i think for the 3dw we wouldn't
 

4737
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:35,830
i think for the 3dw we wouldn't
accept any kind of like fan-made

4738
01:47:35,830 --> 01:47:35,840
accept any kind of like fan-made
 

4739
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:38,790
accept any kind of like fan-made
stuff it would i think i'll be made

4740
01:47:38,790 --> 01:47:38,800
stuff it would i think i'll be made
 

4741
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:40,550
stuff it would i think i'll be made
in-house

4742
01:47:40,550 --> 01:47:40,560
in-house
 

4743
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:44,070
in-house
but maybe like after that uh

4744
01:47:44,070 --> 01:47:44,080
but maybe like after that uh
 

4745
01:47:44,080 --> 01:47:45,990
but maybe like after that uh
if we like after that would ever get

4746
01:47:45,990 --> 01:47:46,000
if we like after that would ever get
 

4747
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,310
if we like after that would ever get
like home 3d

4748
01:47:48,310 --> 01:47:48,320
like home 3d
 

4749
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:50,229
like home 3d
then maybe we could implement something

4750
01:47:50,229 --> 01:47:50,239
then maybe we could implement something
 

4751
01:47:50,239 --> 01:47:52,790
then maybe we could implement something
like that

4752
01:47:52,790 --> 01:47:52,800

 

4753
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:54,229

after that i think it might be a

4754
01:47:54,229 --> 01:47:54,239
after that i think it might be a
 

4755
01:47:54,239 --> 01:47:56,070
after that i think it might be a
possibility just

4756
01:47:56,070 --> 01:47:56,080
possibility just
 

4757
01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:59,750
possibility just
how i like to use uh some

4758
01:47:59,750 --> 01:47:59,760
how i like to use uh some
 

4759
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:02,790

uh yeah i've i haven't really seen
anything like that for the whole life of

4772
01:48:17,990 --> 01:48:18,000
anything like that for the whole life of

but i think if you guys were to make

4776
01:48:22,790 --> 01:48:22,800
but i think if you guys were to make
 

4777
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:26,070
but i think if you guys were to make
anything in 3d that we could use

4778
01:48:26,070 --> 01:48:26,080
anything in 3d that we could use
 

4779
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:29,270
anything in 3d that we could use
and i won't say it's impossible

4780
01:48:29,270 --> 01:48:29,280
and i won't say it's impossible
 

4781
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:31,430
and i won't say it's impossible
