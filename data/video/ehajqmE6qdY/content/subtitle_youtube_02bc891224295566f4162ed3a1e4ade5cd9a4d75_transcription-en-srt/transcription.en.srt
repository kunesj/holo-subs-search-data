out what it was but I I think I know
 

5275
02:31:10,520 --> 02:31:12,830
out what it was but I I think I know
what it was because I was at the very

5276
02:31:12,830 --> 02:31:12,840
what it was because I was at the very
 

5277
02:31:12,840 --> 02:31:14,630
what it was because I was at the very
