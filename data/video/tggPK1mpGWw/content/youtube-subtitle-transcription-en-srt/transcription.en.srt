going to win if cuz like to me it might
 

4435
02:16:44,240 --> 02:16:46,030
going to win if cuz like to me it might
I mean it's not like 100% it's like your

4436
02:16:46,030 --> 02:16:46,040
I mean it's not like 100% it's like your
 

4437
02:16:46,040 --> 02:16:47,110
I mean it's not like 100% it's like your
performance may be different on

4438
02:16:47,110 --> 02:16:47,120
performance may be different on
 

4439
02:16:47,120 --> 02:16:49,830
performance may be different on
different days but if if if France wins

4440
02:16:49,830 --> 02:16:49,840
different days but if if if France wins
 

4441
02:16:49,840 --> 02:16:52,790
different days but if if if France wins
this

4442
02:16:52,790 --> 02:16:52,800
this
 

4443
02:16:52,800 --> 02:16:54,509
this
then that means Neverland is weaker than

4444
02:16:54,509 --> 02:16:54,519
then that means Neverland is weaker than
 

4445
02:16:54,519 --> 02:16:57,629
then that means Neverland is weaker than
France so we almost won against France

4446
02:16:57,629 --> 02:16:57,639
France so we almost won against France
 

4447
02:16:57,639 --> 02:17:00,469
France so we almost won against France
so we didn't but then I think we can win

4448
02:17:00,469 --> 02:17:00,479
so we didn't but then I think we can win
 

4449
02:17:00,479 --> 02:17:02,230
so we didn't but then I think we can win
against

4450
02:17:02,230 --> 02:17:02,240

02:17:02,240 --> 02:17:05,309

on you you should cheer for France on
 

4463
02:17:20,519 --> 02:17:21,870

this one

4464
02:17:21,870 --> 02:17:21,880
this one
 

4465
02:17:21,880 --> 02:17:25,230
this one
H because if Neverland loses this one

4466
02:17:25,230 --> 02:17:25,240
H because if Neverland loses this one
 

4467
02:17:25,240 --> 02:17:26,309
H because if Neverland loses this one
well they're still going to play the

4468
02:17:26,309 --> 02:17:26,319
well they're still going to play the
 

4469
02:17:26,319 --> 02:17:28,509
well they're still going to play the
next one but I guess then if they lose

4470
02:17:28,509 --> 02:17:28,519
next one but I guess then if they lose
 

4471
02:17:28,519 --> 02:17:32,270
next one but I guess then if they lose
this one then Netherlands is not moving

4472
02:17:32,270 --> 02:17:32,280
this one then Netherlands is not moving
 

4473
02:17:32,280 --> 02:17:35,709
this one then Netherlands is not moving
forward

4474
02:17:35,709 --> 02:17:35,719

 

4475
02:17:35,719 --> 02:17:39,349

bit more easy I I think that's when I
started losing weight

10054

10111
04:50:39,840 --> 04:50:41,910
midnight my time and it won't be too
long I think it will be taking only an

10112
04:50:41,910 --> 04:50:41,920
long I think it will be taking only an
 

10113
04:50:41,920 --> 04:50:45,590
long I think it will be taking only an
hour or so I'm and that's if we stall

hour or so I'm and that's if we stall
because I think the ACT we don't have to

10116
04:50:47,190 --> 04:50:47,200
because I think the ACT we don't have to
 

10117

because I think the ACT we don't have to
find the Ender Dragon right we don't

done probably going to go like that I
 

10155
04:51:31,840 --> 04:51:34,750
done probably going to go like that I
think but I was also thinking the game

10156
04:51:34,750 --> 04:51:34,760
think but I was also thinking the game
 

10157
04:51:34,760 --> 04:51:37,190
think but I was also thinking the game
is currently on easy and maybe we're

10158
04:51:37,190 --> 04:51:37,200
is currently on easy and maybe we're
 

10159
04:51:37,200 --> 04:51:39,868
is currently on easy and maybe we're
going to be too strong I was thinking

10160
04:51:39,868 --> 04:51:39,878
going to be too strong I was thinking
 

10161
04:51:39,878 --> 04:51:41,230

10165
04:51:44,680 --> 04:51:47,548
turn it up to normal at least
for the ending I I probably would have

10166
04:51:47,548 --> 04:51:47,558
for the ending I I probably would have
 

10167
04:51:47,558 --> 04:51:50,150
for the ending I I probably would have
to ask the people who set up the server

10168
04:51:50,150 --> 04:51:50,160
to ask the people who set up the server
 

10169
04:51:50,160 --> 04:51:52,628
to ask the people who set up the server
cuz I don't know how to change it but I

10170
04:51:52,628 --> 04:51:52,638
cuz I don't know how to change it but I
 

10171
04:51:52,638 --> 04:51:57,430
cuz I don't know how to change it but I

10959
05:14:15,680 --> 05:14:18,310
Golems spawning so I tried two things at
once I tried like spawn proofing the

10960
05:14:18,310 --> 05:14:18,320
once I tried like spawn proofing the
 

10961
05:14:18,320 --> 05:14:23,110
once I tried like spawn proofing the
area a little bit more H and uh also

10962
05:14:23,110 --> 05:14:23,120
area a little bit more H and uh also
 

10963
05:14:23,120 --> 05:14:26,868
area a little bit more H and uh also
extending the rail one more and like

10964
05:14:26,868 --> 05:14:26,878
extending the rail one more and like
 

10965
05:14:26,878 --> 05:14:30,750
extending the rail one more and like
repositioning the red uh rails so that

10966
05:14:30,750 --> 05:14:30,760
repositioning the red uh rails so that
 

10967
05:14:30,760 --> 05:14:32,590
repositioning the red uh rails so that
he would be a little bit slower I saw

10968
05:14:32,590 --> 05:14:32,600
he would be a little bit slower I saw
 

10969
05:14:32,600 --> 05:14:35,190
he would be a little bit slower I saw
them literally reacting but I thought

10970
05:14:35,190 --> 05:14:35,200
them literally reacting but I thought
 

10971
05:14:35,200 --> 05:14:36,830
them literally reacting but I thought
okay I read something about the

10972
05:14:36,830 --> 05:14:36,840
okay I read something about the
 

10973
05:14:36,840 --> 05:14:40,150
okay I read something about the
milliseconds of ticks and blah blah blah

10974
05:14:40,150 --> 05:14:40,160
milliseconds of ticks and blah blah blah
 

10975
05:14:40,160 --> 05:14:43,830
milliseconds of ticks and blah blah blah
uh that it takes for a Golem to spawn so

10976
05:14:43,830 --> 05:14:43,840
uh that it takes for a Golem to spawn so
 

10977
05:14:43,840 --> 05:14:45,590
uh that it takes for a Golem to spawn so
maybe it's just a small adjustment that

10978
05:14:45,590 --> 05:14:45,600
maybe it's just a small adjustment that
 

10979
05:14:45,600 --> 05:14:47,788
maybe it's just a small adjustment that
is necessary so I made small adjustments

10980
05:14:47,788 --> 05:14:47,798
is necessary so I made small adjustments
 

10981
05:14:47,798 --> 05:14:50,548
is necessary so I made small adjustments
adjustments to the rail and then then it

10982
05:14:50,548 --> 05:14:50,558
adjustments to the rail and then then it
 

10983
05:14:50,558 --> 05:14:51,948
adjustments to the rail and then then it
was finally

10984
05:14:51,948 --> 05:14:51,958
was finally
 

10985
05:14:51,958 --> 05:14:54,590
was finally
working but then even then every once in

10986
05:14:54,590 --> 05:14:54,600
working but then even then every once in
 

10987
05:14:54,600 --> 05:14:56,830
working but then even then every once in
a while the Golem would spawn somewhere

10988
05:14:56,830 --> 05:14:56,840
a while the Golem would spawn somewhere
 

10989
05:14:56,840 --> 05:15:01,948
a while the Golem would spawn somewhere
else around the farm so that each time I

10990
05:15:01,948 --> 05:15:01,958
else around the farm so that each time I
 

10991
05:15:01,958 --> 05:15:03,750
else around the farm so that each time I
would like kill the Golem and then try

10992
05:15:03,750 --> 05:15:03,760
would like kill the Golem and then try
 

10993
05:15:03,760 --> 05:15:05,350
would like kill the Golem and then try
to spawn proof that area where he

10994
05:15:05,350 --> 05:15:05,360
to spawn proof that area where he
 

10995
05:15:05,360 --> 05:15:07,830
to spawn proof that area where he
spawned each time it told me like okay

10996
05:15:07,830 --> 05:15:07,840
spawned each time it told me like okay
 

10997
05:15:07,840 --> 05:15:09,910
spawned each time it told me like okay
so that area can still spawn a Golem

10998
05:15:09,910 --> 05:15:09,920
so that area can still spawn a Golem
 

10999
05:15:09,920 --> 05:15:12,310
so that area can still spawn a Golem
okay okay

11000
05:15:12,310 --> 05:15:12,320
okay okay
 

11001
05:15:12,320 --> 05:15:15,788
okay okay
yeah yeah yeah yeah

11002
05:15:15,788 --> 05:15:15,798
yeah yeah yeah yeah
 

11003
05:15:15,798 --> 05:15:17,990
yeah yeah yeah yeah
troubleshooting real hard but I figured

11004
05:15:17,990 --> 05:15:18,000
troubleshooting real hard but I figured
 

11005
05:15:18,000 --> 05:15:21,110
troubleshooting real hard but I figured
it out it seems to be working and I was

11006
05:15:21,110 --> 05:15:21,120
it out it seems to be working and I was
 

11007
05:15:21,120 --> 05:15:23,470
it out it seems to be working and I was
like I was farming a little bit AFK

11008
05:15:23,470 --> 05:15:23,480
like I was farming a little bit AFK
 

11009
05:15:23,480 --> 05:15:25,670
