over knee socks
 

8667
03:08:56,319 --> 03:08:58,710
over knee socks
so i had i had two

8668
03:08:58,710 --> 03:08:58,720

8677
03:09:08,399 --> 03:09:10,309
like like the teachers wouldn't know
that this is a thing

8678

that this is a thing
 

8679
03:09:10,319 --> 03:09:11,510
that this is a thing
so

8680
03:09:11,510 --> 03:09:11,520
so
 

8681
03:09:11,520 --> 03:09:14,389
so
sometimes i would put a cheat sheet

8682
03:09:14,389 --> 03:09:14,399
sometimes i would put a cheat sheet
 

8683
03:09:14,399 --> 03:09:18,870
sometimes i would put a cheat sheet
underneath the top of my over knee socks

8684

underneath the top of my over knee socks
 

8685
03:09:18,880 --> 03:09:20,389
underneath the top of my over knee socks
because there's no [\h__\h] way that

anybody's gonna check that and then i

8688
03:09:22,790 --> 03:09:22,800
anybody's gonna check that and then i
 

8689
03:09:22,800 --> 03:09:26,070
anybody's gonna check that and then i

there's math involved
 

14637
05:37:51,840 --> 05:37:54,548
there's math involved
really really

14638
05:37:54,548 --> 05:37:54,558
really really
 

14639
05:37:54,558 --> 05:37:57,110
really really
it can be combinations

14640
05:37:57,110 --> 05:37:57,120
it can be combinations
 

14641
05:37:57,120 --> 05:37:59,430

only ah you can also only pick colors
but then i guess the

14644
05:38:00,788 --> 05:38:00,798
but then i guess the
 

14645
05:38:00,798 --> 05:38:03,110
but then i guess the
the payback is small

14646
05:38:03,110 --> 05:38:03,120
the payback is small
 

14647
05:38:03,120 --> 05:38:08,070
the payback is small
i suppose

05:38:08,070 --> 05:38:08,080

 

14649
05:38:08,080 --> 05:38:10,548

the point

14650
05:38:10,548 --> 05:38:10,558
the point
 

14651
05:38:10,558 --> 05:38:11,990
the point
yeah

14652
05:38:11,990 --> 05:38:12,000
