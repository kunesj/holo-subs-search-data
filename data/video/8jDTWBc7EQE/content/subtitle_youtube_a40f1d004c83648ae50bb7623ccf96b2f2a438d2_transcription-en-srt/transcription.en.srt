05:05:31,970 --> 05:05:31,980
works that narissa would play music and
 

11941
05:05:31,980 --> 05:05:34,128
works that narissa would play music and
they would actually go to her and

11942
05:05:34,128 --> 05:05:34,138
they would actually go to her and
 

11943
05:05:34,138 --> 05:05:37,070
they would actually go to her and
therefore be kind of distracted I guess

11944
05:05:37,070 --> 05:05:37,080
therefore be kind of distracted I guess

14445
06:05:55,260 --> 06:05:58,070

also because

14446
06:05:58,070 --> 06:05:58,080

 

14447
06:05:58,080 --> 06:06:02,448

um the herbs and in the recipe it's like

14448
06:06:02,448 --> 06:06:02,458
um the herbs and in the recipe it's like
 

14449
06:06:02,458 --> 06:06:05,150
um the herbs and in the recipe it's like
assuming that all the leaves and

14450
06:06:05,150 --> 06:06:05,160
assuming that all the leaves and
 

14451
06:06:05,160 --> 06:06:07,010
assuming that all the leaves and
everything already picked off

14452
06:06:07,010 --> 06:06:07,020
everything already picked off
 

14453
06:06:07,020 --> 06:06:10,010
everything already picked off
and sometimes they send so many and I

14454
06:06:10,010 --> 06:06:10,020
and sometimes they send so many and I
 

14455
06:06:10,020 --> 06:06:11,270
and sometimes they send so many and I
have to separate them because they're

14456
06:06:11,270 --> 06:06:11,280
have to separate them because they're
 

14457
06:06:11,280 --> 06:06:12,590
have to separate them because they're
like Tangled

14458
06:06:12,590 --> 06:06:12,600
like Tangled
 

14459
06:06:12,600 --> 06:06:14,330
like Tangled
they sent like two different three

14460
06:06:14,330 --> 06:06:14,340
they sent like two different three
 

14461
06:06:14,340 --> 06:06:16,070
they sent like two different three
different herbs all in one package

14462
06:06:16,070 --> 06:06:16,080
different herbs all in one package
 

14463
06:06:16,080 --> 06:06:19,250
different herbs all in one package
tangled up so it takes me actually a lot

14464
06:06:19,250 --> 06:06:19,260
tangled up so it takes me actually a lot
 

14465
06:06:19,260 --> 06:06:21,590
tangled up so it takes me actually a lot
of time to untangle them and then pick

14466
06:06:21,590 --> 06:06:21,600
of time to untangle them and then pick
 

14467
06:06:21,600 --> 06:06:23,330
of time to untangle them and then pick
all the leaves off and then get to

14468
06:06:23,330 --> 06:06:23,340
all the leaves off and then get to
 

14469
06:06:23,340 --> 06:06:26,030
all the leaves off and then get to
cutting the the herbs

14470
06:06:26,030 --> 06:06:26,040
cutting the the herbs
 

14471
06:06:26,040 --> 06:06:29,150
cutting the the herbs
and in the recipe it seems like they

14472
06:06:29,150 --> 06:06:29,160
and in the recipe it seems like they
 

14473
06:06:29,160 --> 06:06:32,030
and in the recipe it seems like they
assume that it's already untangled and

14474
06:06:32,030 --> 06:06:32,040
assume that it's already untangled and
 

14475
06:06:32,040 --> 06:06:34,790
