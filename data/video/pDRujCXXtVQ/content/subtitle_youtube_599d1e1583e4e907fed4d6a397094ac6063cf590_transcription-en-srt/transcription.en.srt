thermometer and then

318
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,000
thermometer and then
 

319
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,469
thermometer and then
you put as much salt in there as you

320
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:31,479
you put as much salt in there as you
 

321
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:32,870

00:08:40,949 --> 00:08:40,959
bit though and then you add lemon juice
 

329
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,509
bit though and then you add lemon juice
that's the crazy part because once you

330
00:08:42,509 --> 00:08:42,519
that's the crazy part because once you
 

331
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:46,190
that's the crazy part because once you
add lemon juice it begins to curdle

332
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:46,200
add lemon juice it begins to curdle
 

333
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,829
add lemon juice it begins to curdle
immediately as in it forms all of these

334
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:49,839
immediately as in it forms all of these
 

335
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,389
immediately as in it forms all of these
these

336
00:08:51,389 --> 00:08:51,399
these
 

337
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:55,150
these
little clumps of cheese just gathers

338
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:55,160
little clumps of cheese just gathers
 

339
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,150
little clumps of cheese just gathers
together and gets

340
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:57,160
together and gets
 

341
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,430
together and gets
compact yeah clumps of cheese that's

342
00:08:59,430 --> 00:08:59,440
compact yeah clumps of cheese that's

15225
06:41:18,478 --> 06:41:21,110
nobody's in the server then you can skip
days or even a week in between yeah that

15226
06:41:21,110 --> 06:41:21,120
days or even a week in between yeah that
 

15227
06:41:21,120 --> 06:41:23,788
days or even a week in between yeah that
is true we can definitely skip sometimes

15228
