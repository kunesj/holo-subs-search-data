593
00:21:57,659 --> 00:21:59,270

594
00:21:59,270 --> 00:21:59,280
teammate obviously it will go directly
 

595
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,930

to the closest opponent driver that's
 

597
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,570
to the closest opponent driver that's

598
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:05,580
around you so yeah that's how that team
 

599
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,740
