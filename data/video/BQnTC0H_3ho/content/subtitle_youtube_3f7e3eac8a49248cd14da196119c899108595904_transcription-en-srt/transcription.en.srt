04:19:51,830 --> 04:19:51,840
construction people and there was like
 

9729
04:19:51,840 --> 04:19:53,689
construction people and there was like
really a small group it was definitely a

9730
04:19:53,689 --> 04:19:53,699
really a small group it was definitely a

but they were like

9734
04:19:57,830 --> 04:19:57,840
but they were like
 

9735
04:19:57,840 --> 04:19:58,910
but they were like
they didn't look like construction

9736
04:19:58,910 --> 04:19:58,920
they didn't look like construction
 

9737
04:19:58,920 --> 04:20:01,429

quite like it and I'm like could this be
 

9743
04:20:07,080 --> 04:20:10,429
quite like it and I'm like could this be
but why here

9744

9748
04:20:16,189 --> 04:20:16,199
yeah but then I saw like like a logo and
 

9749
04:20:16,199 --> 04:20:17,809
yeah but then I saw like like a logo and
it said something like that there's

9750
04:20:17,809 --> 04:20:17,819
it said something like that there's
 

9751
04:20:17,819 --> 04:20:20,150
it said something like that there's
something like archaeologists or so

9752
04:20:20,150 --> 04:20:20,160
something like archaeologists or so
 

9753
04:20:20,160 --> 04:20:23,150

9755
04:20:23,160 --> 04:20:25,130

yeah I guess they have to do that maybe

9756
04:20:25,130 --> 04:20:25,140
yeah I guess they have to do that maybe
 

9757
04:20:25,140 --> 04:20:28,250
yeah I guess they have to do that maybe
before they construct something which

9758
04:20:28,250 --> 04:20:28,260
before they construct something which
 

9759
04:20:28,260 --> 04:20:29,809
before they construct something which
makes a lot of sense

9760
04:20:29,809 --> 04:20:29,819
makes a lot of sense
 

9761
04:20:29,819 --> 04:20:32,809
makes a lot of sense
they should do that everywhere

9762
04:20:32,809 --> 04:20:32,819
they should do that everywhere
 

9763
04:20:32,819 --> 04:20:34,630

9769
04:20:39,000 --> 04:20:41,389
