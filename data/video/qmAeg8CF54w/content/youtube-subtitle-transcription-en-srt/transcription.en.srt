I didn't realize this was gonna take
 

4097
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:17,750
I didn't realize this was gonna take
someone's brain power

Japanese now okay
but I think I told you already in this

4106
01:45:27,830 --> 01:45:27,840
but I think I told you already in this
 

4107
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:36,729
but I think I told you already in this
case I would say uh pixel art

4108
01:45:36,729 --> 01:45:36,739

 

4109
01:45:36,739 --> 01:45:39,649

is like don't don't direct the translate

4110
01:45:39,649 --> 01:45:39,659
is like don't don't direct the translate
 

4111
01:45:39,659 --> 01:45:43,250
is like don't don't direct the translate
it's like don't lick me but

4112
01:45:43,250 --> 01:45:43,260
it's like don't lick me but
 

4113
01:45:43,260 --> 01:45:45,830
it's like don't lick me but
but that's just directly translated if

4114
01:45:45,830 --> 01:45:45,840
but that's just directly translated if
 

4115
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:48,109
but that's just directly translated if
you would translate it uh not directly

4116
01:45:48,109 --> 01:45:48,119
you would translate it uh not directly
 

4117
01:45:48,119 --> 01:45:50,510
you would translate it uh not directly
but what it actually means is like don't

4118
01:45:50,510 --> 01:45:50,520
but what it actually means is like don't
 

4119
01:45:50,520 --> 01:45:53,930
but what it actually means is like don't
don't underestimate for example don't

4120
01:45:53,930 --> 01:45:53,940
don't underestimate for example don't
 

4121
01:45:53,940 --> 01:45:57,890
don't underestimate for example don't
underestimate uh pixel art I will not

4122
01:45:57,890 --> 01:45:57,900
underestimate uh pixel art I will not
 

4123
01:45:57,900 --> 01:46:00,050
underestimate uh pixel art I will not
underestimate my strength and my power

4124
01:46:00,050 --> 01:46:00,060
underestimate my strength and my power
 

4125
01:46:00,060 --> 01:46:04,010
underestimate my strength and my power
don't lick the pixel art I'll make the

4136
01:46:17,689 --> 01:46:17,699
guess I mean both
 

4137
01:46:17,699 --> 01:46:21,109
guess I mean both
lick the pixel art

4138
01:46:21,109 --> 01:46:21,119
lick the pixel art
 

4139
01:46:21,119 --> 01:46:23,750
lick the pixel art
well oh wait I wanted to make the arm oh

4140
01:46:23,750 --> 01:46:23,760
well oh wait I wanted to make the arm oh
 

4141
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:26,570
well oh wait I wanted to make the arm oh
 okay before I continue that I guess

4142
01:46:26,570 --> 01:46:26,580
okay before I continue that I guess
 

4143
01:46:26,580 --> 01:46:29,390
okay before I continue that I guess
that makes the arm I don't want to make

4144
01:46:29,390 --> 01:46:29,400
that makes the arm I don't want to make
 

4145
01:46:29,400 --> 01:46:31,250
that makes the arm I don't want to make
the arm because then there's like space

4146
01:46:31,250 --> 01:46:31,260
the arm because then there's like space
 

4147
01:46:31,260 --> 01:46:35,149
the arm because then there's like space
in between all right all right all right

4148
01:46:35,149 --> 01:46:35,159
in between all right all right all right
 

4149
01:46:35,159 --> 01:46:37,669
in between all right all right all right
okay so that's

4150
01:46:37,669 --> 01:46:37,679
okay so that's
 

4151
01:46:37,679 --> 01:46:40,250
okay so that's
uh

random distance really really high I

5438
02:18:32,089 --> 02:18:32,099
random distance really really high I
 

5439
02:18:32,099 --> 02:18:35,030

yeah
okay so I think there should be sand

5446
02:18:41,929 --> 02:18:41,939
okay so I think there should be sand
 

5447
02:18:41,939 --> 02:18:47,349
okay so I think there should be sand
over there

5448
02:18:47,349 --> 02:18:47,359

 

5449
02:18:47,359 --> 02:18:51,290

stream for this one and I always go back

7402
03:09:38,330 --> 03:09:38,340
stream for this one and I always go back
 

7403
03:09:38,340 --> 03:09:40,429
stream for this one and I always go back
to the first one yeah I forgot that

7404

I forgot to do because I thought I did a
 

7409
03:09:43,560 --> 03:09:45,410
I forgot to do because I thought I did a
reuse for this this stream but I didn't

7410
03:09:45,410 --> 03:09:45,420
reuse for this this stream but I didn't
 

7411
03:09:45,420 --> 03:09:49,450
reuse for this this stream but I didn't
so sorry guys that's why there's delays

7412

scaffolding I need to make more

7418
03:09:58,190 --> 03:09:58,200
scaffolding I need to make more
 

7419
03:09:58,200 --> 03:10:02,269
scaffolding I need to make more
oh yeah I'm I'm at the point where where

7420
03:10:02,269 --> 03:10:02,279
oh yeah I'm I'm at the point where where
 

7421
03:10:02,279 --> 03:10:05,030
oh yeah I'm I'm at the point where where
I accepted the fact that if I go any

7422
03:10:05,030 --> 03:10:05,040
I accepted the fact that if I go any
 

7423
03:10:05,040 --> 03:10:07,729
I accepted the fact that if I go any
higher than this then there will be no

7424
03:10:07,729 --> 03:10:07,739
higher than this then there will be no
 

7425
03:10:07,739 --> 03:10:10,190
higher than this then there will be no
uh scaffolding

7426
03:10:10,190 --> 03:10:10,200
uh scaffolding
 

7427
03:10:10,200 --> 03:10:11,710
uh scaffolding
um

7428
03:10:11,710 --> 03:10:11,720
um
 

7429
03:10:11,720 --> 03:10:14,809

whereas if the DVR is off then they
 

7447
03:10:31,080 --> 03:10:34,570
whereas if the DVR is off then they
can't go back until the bond is done

7448
03:10:34,570 --> 03:10:34,580
can't go back until the bond is done
 

7449

right I think if we would have turned on
grids earlier we could have

14192
06:07:06,948 --> 06:07:06,958
grids earlier we could have
 

14193
06:07:06,958 --> 06:07:10,090
grids earlier we could have
um been done earlier yeah the

14194
06:07:10,090 --> 06:07:10,100
um been done earlier yeah the
 

14195
06:07:10,100 --> 06:07:14,390
um been done earlier yeah the
