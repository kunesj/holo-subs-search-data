193
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,790
I'm guessing that the zombies will go to
wherever they like they're programmed

194
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:14,800
wherever they like they're programmed
 

195

wherever they like they're programmed
probably to know where the players are

196
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:16,560
probably to know where the players are
 

197
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,469
probably to know where the players are
and they'll just go wherever the players

198
00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:18,479
and they'll just go wherever the players

307
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,389
Trader which anybody's welcome to use
but uh I've heard from the chat that the

308
00:11:05,389 --> 00:11:05,399
but uh I've heard from the chat that the
 

309
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,670
but uh I've heard from the chat that the
the zombies uh for the invasion will

310
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:07,680
the zombies uh for the invasion will
 

311
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,470
the zombies uh for the invasion will
only attack where players are so if we

312
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:10,480
only attack where players are so if we
 

313
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,150
only attack where players are so if we
just abandon our house for the zombie

314
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:12,160
just abandon our house for the zombie
 

315
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,990
just abandon our house for the zombie
attack and go to the main house where we

316
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:14,000
attack and go to the main house where we
 

317
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,110
attack and go to the main house where we
all started off uh then they will ignore

318
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:16,120
all started off uh then they will ignore
 

319
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,310
all started off uh then they will ignore
a house so I think that's what we're

320
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:17,320
a house so I think that's what we're
 

321
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,990
a house so I think that's what we're
going to do I think that's a good idea

322
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:20,000
going to do I think that's a good idea
 

323
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,350
going to do I think that's a good idea
that's a great idea so that we don't

324
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:21,360
that's a great idea so that we don't
 

325
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,829
that's a great idea so that we don't
have to protect two

326
00:11:22,829 --> 00:11:22,839
have to protect two
 

327
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:25,389

now for now in the meantime I will yeah
hello I think we should really try to

664
00:19:02,789 --> 00:19:02,799
hello I think we should really try to
 

665
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,669
hello I think we should really try to
get the uh the thing that collects water

666
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:05,679
get the uh the thing that collects water
 

667
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,110
get the uh the thing that collects water
because that way we can get an active we

668
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:09,120
because that way we can get an active we
 

669
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,669
because that way we can get an active we
need to have about let me see what how

670
00:19:12,669 --> 00:19:12,679
need to have about let me see what how
 

671
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:17,230
need to have about let me see what how
much was it um we need about 100 scrap

672
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:17,240
much was it um we need about 100 scrap
 

673
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,789
much was it um we need about 100 scrap
polymers so if any we should all pull

674
00:19:19,789 --> 00:19:19,799
polymers so if any we should all pull
 

675
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:21,669
polymers so if any we should all pull
our scrap polymers together to make that

676
00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:21,679
our scrap polymers together to make that
 

677
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,590
our scrap polymers together to make that
water collecting thing so we can have

678
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:23,600
water collecting thing so we can have
 

679
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:29,310
water collecting thing so we can have
fresh water instead of diarrhea water

680
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:29,320

 

681
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,390

yeah yeah how do you unlock a

682
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:31,400
yeah yeah how do you unlock a
 

683
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,029
yeah yeah how do you unlock a
workstation do you need a level of

684
00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:33,039
workstation do you need a level of
 

685
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,669
workstation do you need a level of
Robotics or

686
00:19:35,669 --> 00:19:35,679
Robotics or
 

687
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,750
Robotics or
engineering um I thought that you needed

688
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:37,760
engineering um I thought that you needed
 

689
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,070
engineering um I thought that you needed
at least one in the advanced engineering

690
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:40,080
at least one in the advanced engineering
 

691
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,149
at least one in the advanced engineering
um which one was it let me look up what

692
00:19:42,149 --> 00:19:42,159
um which one was it let me look up what
 

693
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:45,430
um which one was it let me look up what
it was called there's a specific one um

694
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:45,440
it was called there's a specific one um
 

695
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,110
it was called there's a specific one um
yeah in advanced engineering I'm pretty

696
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:47,120
yeah in advanced engineering I'm pretty
 

697
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,990
yeah in advanced engineering I'm pretty
sure that you need like one you need to

698
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:49,000
sure that you need like one you need to
 

699
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,669
sure that you need like one you need to
just be like Apprentice or so and then

700
00:19:50,669 --> 00:19:50,679
just be like Apprentice or so and then
 

701
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:52,149
just be like Apprentice or so and then
you can make a

702
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:52,159
you can make a
 

703
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:56,070
you can make a
workbench oh yeah no actually I not

704
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:56,080
workbench oh yeah no actually I not
 

705

understand but I figure it out
 

707
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,990
understand but I figure it out
I tried to advance in an engineer but it

708
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:03,000
I tried to advance in an engineer but it
 

709
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,990
I tried to advance in an engineer but it
still doesn't make me do the workbench

710
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:05,000
still doesn't make me do the workbench
 

711
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,470
still doesn't make me do the workbench
for some reason really strange that's

712

8140
03:23:10,790 --> 03:23:10,800
shotgun should be yeah like front or
 

8141
03:23:10,800 --> 03:23:13,189
shotgun should be yeah like front or
like back do you think um I think what

8142
03:23:13,189 --> 03:23:13,199
like back do you think um I think what
 

8143
03:23:13,199 --> 03:23:15,550
like back do you think um I think what
we should do is we everyone looks

8144
03:23:15,550 --> 03:23:15,560
we should do is we everyone looks
 

8145
03:23:15,560 --> 03:23:17,349
we should do is we everyone looks
together and we check they go because

8146
03:23:17,349 --> 03:23:17,359
together and we check they go because
 

8147
03:23:17,359 --> 03:23:19,110
together and we check they go because
they're going to try going where there's

8148
03:23:19,110 --> 03:23:19,120
they're going to try going where there's
 

8149
03:23:19,120 --> 03:23:22,269
they're going to try going where there's
like the least the least resistance

8150
03:23:22,269 --> 03:23:22,279
like the least the least resistance
 

8151
03:23:22,279 --> 03:23:25,349
like the least the least resistance
right so once we realize that that might

8152
03:23:25,349 --> 03:23:25,359
right so once we realize that that might
 

8153
03:23:25,359 --> 03:23:26,830
right so once we realize that that might
be the front or the back and then once

8154
03:23:26,830 --> 03:23:26,840
be the front or the back and then once
 

8155
03:23:26,840 --> 03:23:29,590
be the front or the back and then once
we realize we uh you should go where

8156
03:23:29,590 --> 03:23:29,600
we realize we uh you should go where
 

8157
03:23:29,600 --> 03:23:31,229
we realize we uh you should go where
it's the less probably back because the

8158
03:23:31,229 --> 03:23:31,239
it's the less probably back because the
 

8159
03:23:31,239 --> 03:23:33,389
it's the less probably back because the
front has the big fence so the back

8160
03:23:33,389 --> 03:23:33,399
front has the big fence so the back
 

8161
03:23:33,399 --> 03:23:34,830
front has the big fence so the back
might be better we should probably close

8162
03:23:34,830 --> 03:23:34,840
might be better we should probably close
 

8163
03:23:34,840 --> 03:23:37,550
might be better we should probably close
out the window
