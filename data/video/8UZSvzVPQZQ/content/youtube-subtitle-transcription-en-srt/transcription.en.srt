133
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,469
what 12 hours or 12 hours 10
hours so there's a dungeon and a half

134
00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:54,479
hours so there's a dungeon and a half
 

135
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,790

it's to me that sounds like totally

manageable also I heard that the last

138
00:07:58,869 --> 00:07:58,879
manageable also I heard that the last
 

139
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,270
manageable also I heard that the last
dungeon is short so shorter than the

140
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:02,280
dungeon is short so shorter than the
 

141
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,749

the problem is that the
 

3293
01:53:56,119 --> 01:53:58,950
the problem is that the
quality is often really

3294
01:53:58,950 --> 01:53:58,960
quality is often really
 

3295
01:53:58,960 --> 01:54:02,030

2 especially today when I

12266
06:55:17,548 --> 06:55:17,558
2 especially today when I
 

12267
06:55:17,558 --> 06:55:21,190
2 especially today when I
explained uh what the plot

12268
06:55:21,190 --> 06:55:21,200
explained uh what the plot
 

12269
06:55:21,200 --> 06:55:24,750
explained uh what the plot
is I realized there is really not much

12270
06:55:24,750 --> 06:55:24,760
is I realized there is really not much
 

12271
06:55:24,760 --> 06:55:26,670
is I realized there is really not much
special plot like they go in a little

12272
06:55:26,670 --> 06:55:26,680
special plot like they go in a little
 

12273
06:55:26,680 --> 06:55:28,350
special plot like they go in a little
adventure and all that but there's no

12274
06:55:28,350 --> 06:55:28,360
adventure and all that but there's no
 

12275
06:55:28,360 --> 06:55:30,830
adventure and all that but there's no
real big deep

12276
06:55:30,830 --> 06:55:30,840
real big deep
 

12277
06:55:30,840 --> 06:55:34,270
real big deep
reason and

12278
06:55:34,270 --> 06:55:34,280
reason and
 

12279
06:55:34,280 --> 06:55:36,628
reason and
it all just starts out of a

12280
06:55:36,628 --> 06:55:36,638
it all just starts out of a
 

12281
06:55:36,638 --> 06:55:39,310
it all just starts out of a
whim while rise of one it seems like

12282
06:55:39,310 --> 06:55:39,320
whim while rise of one it seems like
 

12283
06:55:39,320 --> 06:55:41,430
whim while rise of one it seems like
there is much more

12284
06:55:41,430 --> 06:55:41,440
there is much more
 

12285
06:55:41,440 --> 06:55:43,628
there is much more
purpose

12286
06:55:43,628 --> 06:55:43,638
purpose
 

12287
06:55:43,638 --> 06:55:46,468
purpose
and however it didn't ruin the game at

12288
06:55:46,468 --> 06:55:46,478
and however it didn't ruin the game at
 

12289
06:55:46,478 --> 06:55:50,468
and however it didn't ruin the game at
all it still wins over rise one it still

12290
06:55:50,468 --> 06:55:50,478
all it still wins over rise one it still
 

12291
06:55:50,478 --> 06:55:53,070
all it still wins over rise one it still
wins because everything else is so

12292
06:55:53,070 --> 06:55:53,080
wins because everything else is so
 

12293
06:55:53,080 --> 06:55:55,590
wins because everything else is so
strong and the characters that the new

12294
06:55:55,590 --> 06:55:55,600
strong and the characters that the new
 

12295
06:55:55,600 --> 06:55:58,750
strong and the characters that the new
characters that came in are also so

12296
06:55:58,750 --> 06:55:58,760
characters that came in are also so
 

12297
06:55:58,760 --> 06:56:01,708
characters that came in are also so
strong like they leave such

12298
06:56:01,708 --> 06:56:01,718
strong like they leave such
 

12299
06:56:01,718 --> 06:56:03,788
strong like they leave such
a

12300
06:56:03,788 --> 06:56:03,798
a
 

12301
06:56:03,798 --> 06:56:08,910
a
um deep image and connection cuz each

12302
06:56:08,910 --> 06:56:08,920
um deep image and connection cuz each
 

12303
06:56:08,920 --> 06:56:11,510
um deep image and connection cuz each
character is fought through so well in

12304
06:56:11,510 --> 06:56:11,520
character is fought through so well in
 

12305
06:56:11,520 --> 06:56:14,990
character is fought through so well in
my

12306
06:56:14,990 --> 06:56:15,000

 

12307
06:56:15,000 --> 06:56:17,510

opinion yeah so they make up for it I

12308
06:56:17,510 --> 06:56:17,520
opinion yeah so they make up for it I
 

12309
06:56:17,520 --> 06:56:20,270
opinion yeah so they make up for it I
guess for the yeah a lasting impression

12310
06:56:20,270 --> 06:56:20,280
guess for the yeah a lasting impression
 

12311
06:56:20,280 --> 06:56:23,150
guess for the yeah a lasting impression
I guess too they make up for it and the

12312
06:56:23,150 --> 06:56:23,160
I guess too they make up for it and the
 

12313
06:56:23,160 --> 06:56:24,990
I guess too they make up for it and the
battle system definitely also makes up

12314
06:56:24,990 --> 06:56:25,000
battle system definitely also makes up
 

12315
06:56:25,000 --> 06:56:27,510
battle system definitely also makes up
for it maybe there's some other things

12316
06:56:27,510 --> 06:56:27,520
for it maybe there's some other things
 

12317
06:56:27,520 --> 06:56:29,388
for it maybe there's some other things
that improved I guess like Alchemy and

12318
06:56:29,388 --> 06:56:29,398
that improved I guess like Alchemy and
 

12319
06:56:29,398 --> 06:56:30,788
that improved I guess like Alchemy and
all that but I can't really judge it

12320
06:56:30,788 --> 06:56:30,798
all that but I can't really judge it
 

12321
06:56:30,798 --> 06:56:32,070
all that but I can't really judge it
that much because those are some things

12322
06:56:32,070 --> 06:56:32,080
that much because those are some things
 

12323
06:56:32,080 --> 06:56:34,310
that much because those are some things
where I just fck that in Risa one

12324
06:56:34,310 --> 06:56:34,320
where I just fck that in Risa one
 

12325
06:56:34,320 --> 06:56:37,230
where I just fck that in Risa one
because I didn't understand it that well

12326
06:56:37,230 --> 06:56:37,240
because I didn't understand it that well
 

12327
06:56:37,240 --> 06:56:38,350
because I didn't understand it that well
even at the

12328
06:56:38,350 --> 06:56:38,360
even at the
 

12329
06:56:38,360 --> 06:56:42,830
even at the
end but I guess Alchemy maybe improved

12330
06:56:42,830 --> 06:56:42,840
end but I guess Alchemy maybe improved
 

12331
06:56:42,840 --> 06:56:44,788
end but I guess Alchemy maybe improved
as as well I'm not sure I can't really

12332
06:56:44,788 --> 06:56:44,798
as as well I'm not sure I can't really
 

12333
06:56:44,798 --> 06:56:46,750
as as well I'm not sure I can't really
judge

12334
06:56:46,750 --> 06:56:46,760
judge
 

12335
06:56:46,760 --> 06:56:50,868
judge
that the systems are different and

12336
06:56:50,868 --> 06:56:50,878
that the systems are different and
 

12337
06:56:50,878 --> 06:56:52,468
that the systems are different and
um

12338
06:56:52,468 --> 06:56:52,478
um
 

12339
06:56:52,478 --> 06:56:57,350
um
yeah I guess it was better in some way

12340
06:56:57,350 --> 06:56:57,360
yeah I guess it was better in some way
 

12341
06:56:57,360 --> 06:57:01,628
yeah I guess it was better in some way
maybe easier in two maybe

12342
06:57:01,628 --> 06:57:01,638
maybe easier in two maybe
 

12343
06:57:01,638 --> 06:57:03,150
maybe easier in two maybe
maybe

12344
06:57:03,150 --> 06:57:03,160
