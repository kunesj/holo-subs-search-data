1228
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:11,040
was there anything like you look so
 

1229
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,889
was there anything like you look so
critical but was there anything that you

1230
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:12,899
critical but was there anything that you
 

1231
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:14,810
critical but was there anything that you
could tell was like absolutely wrong

1232
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:14,820
could tell was like absolutely wrong
 

1233
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:18,169
could tell was like absolutely wrong
compared to the books and she said no

1234
00:34:18,169 --> 00:34:18,179
compared to the books and she said no
 

1235
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:19,930
compared to the books and she said no
but

1236
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:19,940
but
 

1237
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:23,990
but
I think she

1238
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:24,000

 

1239
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,750

I think she her biggest problem is like

1240
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:26,760
I think she her biggest problem is like
 

1241
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:30,530
I think she her biggest problem is like
the maybe the personalities or something

1242
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:30,540
the maybe the personalities or something
 

1243
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:34,010
the maybe the personalities or something
but hey at least in that episode The

1244
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:34,020
but hey at least in that episode The
 

1245
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,710
but hey at least in that episode The
like plot itself

1246
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:36,720
like plot itself
 

1247
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,869
like plot itself
wasn't like

1248
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:38,879
wasn't like
 

1249
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:40,310
wasn't like
off

1250
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:40,320
off
 

1251
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,750
off
so

1252
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:41,760
so
 

1253
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,990
so
it can't be that bad

1254
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:44,000
it can't be that bad
 

1255
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,149
it can't be that bad
and really I thought

1256
00:34:47,149 --> 00:34:47,159
and really I thought
 

1257
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:49,369
and really I thought
I think the second season so far is

1258
00:34:49,369 --> 00:34:49,379
I think the second season so far is
 

1259
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:53,089
I think the second season so far is
going better than the first season

1260
00:34:53,089 --> 00:34:53,099

 

1261
00:34:53,099 --> 00:34:53,180

and I wonder if I put like a like a
 

4081
01:39:58,679 --> 01:40:03,830
and I wonder if I put like a like a
cooling pad cooling thingy on top of the

4082
01:40:03,830 --> 01:40:03,840
cooling pad cooling thingy on top of the

4085
01:40:06,120 --> 01:40:09,169

if it's if the coolness can go through

01:40:09,169 --> 01:40:09,179
if it's if the coolness can go through
 

4087
01:40:09,179 --> 01:40:11,810
if it's if the coolness can go through
the material and cool the food a little

4088
01:40:11,810 --> 01:40:11,820
the material and cool the food a little
 

4089
01:40:11,820 --> 01:40:12,770
the material and cool the food a little
bit

4090

the guy who stands with his sign
 

9229
03:46:21,000 --> 03:46:22,670
the guy who stands with his sign
everywhere

everywhere
I like that guy like I didn't also

9232
03:46:25,250 --> 03:46:25,260
I like that guy like I didn't also
 

9233
03:46:25,260 --> 03:46:27,050

9234
03:46:27,050 --> 03:46:27,060

9235
03:46:27,060 --> 03:46:28,849

doing his

9236
03:46:28,849 --> 03:46:28,859
doing his
 

9237
03:46:28,859 --> 03:46:30,250

um thing

9238
03:46:30,250 --> 03:46:30,260
um thing
 

9239
03:46:30,260 --> 03:46:35,510
um thing
but I I liked him

9240
03:46:35,510 --> 03:46:35,520

 

9241
03:46:35,520 --> 03:46:38,210

there's maybe a little bit too many of

9242
03:46:38,210 --> 03:46:38,220
there's maybe a little bit too many of
 

9243
03:46:38,220 --> 03:46:40,610
there's maybe a little bit too many of
him

9244
03:46:40,610 --> 03:46:40,620

 

9245
03:46:40,620 --> 03:46:43,250

but I think it's

9246
03:46:43,250 --> 03:46:43,260
but I think it's
 

9247
03:46:43,260 --> 03:46:45,410
but I think it's
um a fun little in-between thing to

9248
03:46:45,410 --> 03:46:45,420
um a fun little in-between thing to
 

9249
03:46:45,420 --> 03:46:47,150
um a fun little in-between thing to
figure out how to make that science

9250
03:46:47,150 --> 03:46:47,160
figure out how to make that science
 

9251
03:46:47,160 --> 03:46:50,450
figure out how to make that science
stand I enjoyed it

9252
03:46:50,450 --> 03:46:50,460
stand I enjoyed it
 

9253
03:46:50,460 --> 03:46:53,150
stand I enjoyed it
yeah

9254
03:46:53,150 --> 03:46:53,160

 

9255
03:46:53,160 --> 03:46:55,610

but I think his problem was when he

9256
03:46:55,610 --> 03:46:55,620
but I think his problem was when he
 

9257
03:46:55,620 --> 03:46:58,010
but I think his problem was when he
first did one he thought that was the

9258
03:46:58,010 --> 03:46:58,020
first did one he thought that was the
 

9259
03:46:58,020 --> 03:47:00,170
first did one he thought that was the
only one and that he's done with it and

9260
03:47:00,170 --> 03:47:00,180
only one and that he's done with it and
 

9261
03:47:00,180 --> 03:47:03,590
only one and that he's done with it and
then it's ah then he saw him

9262
03:47:03,590 --> 03:47:03,600
then it's ah then he saw him
 

9263
03:47:03,600 --> 03:47:06,229
then it's ah then he saw him
uh there was a misunderstanding he saw

9264
03:47:06,229 --> 03:47:06,239
uh there was a misunderstanding he saw
 

9265
03:47:06,239 --> 03:47:08,570
uh there was a misunderstanding he saw
the same NPC all over the world several

9266
03:47:08,570 --> 03:47:08,580
the same NPC all over the world several
 

9267
03:47:08,580 --> 03:47:12,050
the same NPC all over the world several
times and he just assumed that the quest

9268
03:47:12,050 --> 03:47:12,060
times and he just assumed that the quest
 

9269
03:47:12,060 --> 03:47:15,290
times and he just assumed that the quest
was already finished by doing it once

9270
03:47:15,290 --> 03:47:15,300
was already finished by doing it once
 

9271
03:47:15,300 --> 03:47:19,010
was already finished by doing it once
so he ran by them so many times that

9272
03:47:19,010 --> 03:47:19,020
so he ran by them so many times that
 

9273
03:47:19,020 --> 03:47:21,170
so he ran by them so many times that
eventually when he realized by the

9274
03:47:21,170 --> 03:47:21,180
eventually when he realized by the
 

9275
03:47:21,180 --> 03:47:24,710
eventually when he realized by the
comments and all that that uh it wasn't

9276
03:47:24,710 --> 03:47:24,720
comments and all that that uh it wasn't
 

9277
03:47:24,720 --> 03:47:26,750
comments and all that that uh it wasn't
done you have to do every single one of

9278
03:47:26,750 --> 03:47:26,760
done you have to do every single one of
 

9279
03:47:26,760 --> 03:47:29,030
done you have to do every single one of
them

9280
03:47:29,030 --> 03:47:29,040

 

9281
03:47:29,040 --> 03:47:30,550

um then he was like

9282
03:47:30,550 --> 03:47:30,560
um then he was like
 

9283
03:47:30,560 --> 03:47:33,650
um then he was like
fucktal that sucks

9284
03:47:33,650 --> 03:47:33,660
fucktal that sucks
 

9285
03:47:33,660 --> 03:47:36,110
fucktal that sucks
and yeah because we already missed so

9286
03:47:36,110 --> 03:47:36,120
and yeah because we already missed so
 

9287
03:47:36,120 --> 03:47:39,710
and yeah because we already missed so
many then he decided that's [\h__\h] and he

9288
03:47:39,710 --> 03:47:39,720
many then he decided that's [\h__\h] and he
 

9289
03:47:39,720 --> 03:47:41,389
many then he decided that's [\h__\h] and he
doesn't want to do them

9290
03:47:41,389 --> 03:47:41,399
doesn't want to do them
 

9291
03:47:41,399 --> 03:47:43,010
doesn't want to do them
well in the end he had to do them

9292
03:47:43,010 --> 03:47:43,020
well in the end he had to do them
 

9293
03:47:43,020 --> 03:47:44,389
well in the end he had to do them
because they count for the hundred

9294
03:47:44,389 --> 03:47:44,399
because they count for the hundred
 

9295
03:47:44,399 --> 03:47:46,969
because they count for the hundred
percent

9296
03:47:46,969 --> 03:47:46,979

 

9297
03:47:46,979 --> 03:47:48,650

9298
03:47:48,650 --> 03:47:48,660
yeah
 

9299
03:47:48,660 --> 03:47:50,870
yeah
if he would have understood from the

9300
03:47:50,870 --> 03:47:50,880
if he would have understood from the
 

9301
03:47:50,880 --> 03:47:52,490
if he would have understood from the
beginning then he might have just

9302
03:47:52,490 --> 03:47:52,500
beginning then he might have just
 

9303
03:47:52,500 --> 03:47:55,190
beginning then he might have just
enjoyed it more but I feel like he

9304
03:47:55,190 --> 03:47:55,200
enjoyed it more but I feel like he
 

9305
03:47:55,200 --> 03:48:03,050
enjoyed it more but I feel like he
ruined his own experience yeah yeah

you would be a riot to startle as a
 

10293

don't try and they also don't
accidentally do it though I can I think

10302
04:13:32,389 --> 04:13:32,399
