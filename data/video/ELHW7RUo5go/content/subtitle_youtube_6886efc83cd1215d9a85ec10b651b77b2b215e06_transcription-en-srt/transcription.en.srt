11279

I will try my best maybe I'll even take

11280
05:18:10,190 --> 05:18:10,200
I will try my best maybe I'll even take
 

11281
05:18:10,200 --> 05:18:12,948
I will try my best maybe I'll even take
up some oneon-one lessons again but I

11282
05:18:12,948 --> 05:18:12,958
up some oneon-one lessons again but I
 

11283
05:18:12,958 --> 05:18:15,430
up some oneon-one lessons again but I
don't know it already always made me

11284
05:18:15,430 --> 05:18:15,440
don't know it already always made me
 

11285
05:18:15,440 --> 05:18:17,590
don't know it already always made me
feel so nervous and pressured like the

11286
05:18:17,590 --> 05:18:17,600
feel so nervous and pressured like the
 

11287
05:18:17,600 --> 05:18:21,190
feel so nervous and pressured like the
homework and stuff was quite a lot and I

11288
05:18:21,190 --> 05:18:21,200
homework and stuff was quite a lot and I
 

11289
05:18:21,200 --> 05:18:22,470
homework and stuff was quite a lot and I
didn't feel like I

11290
05:18:22,470 --> 05:18:22,480
didn't feel like I
 

11291
05:18:22,480 --> 05:18:25,708
didn't feel like I
could keep up with it cuz it was so much

11292
05:18:25,708 --> 05:18:25,718
could keep up with it cuz it was so much
 

11293
05:18:25,718 --> 05:18:30,070
could keep up with it cuz it was so much
information each lesson and was

11294
05:18:30,070 --> 05:18:30,080
information each lesson and was
 

11295
05:18:30,080 --> 05:18:32,788
information each lesson and was
weekly and and I didn't have time to

11296
05:18:32,788 --> 05:18:32,798
weekly and and I didn't have time to
 

11297
05:18:32,798 --> 05:18:36,270
weekly and and I didn't have time to
repeat on my own time what I learned

11298
05:18:36,270 --> 05:18:36,280
repeat on my own time what I learned
 

11299
05:18:36,280 --> 05:18:39,430
repeat on my own time what I learned
mostly so I felt pretty overwhelmed with

11300
05:18:39,430 --> 05:18:39,440
mostly so I felt pretty overwhelmed with
 

11301
05:18:39,440 --> 05:18:41,590
mostly so I felt pretty overwhelmed with
it I wish I I probably could have

11302
05:18:41,590 --> 05:18:41,600
it I wish I I probably could have
 

11303
05:18:41,600 --> 05:18:43,470
it I wish I I probably could have
requested to go at a slower Pace but at

11304
05:18:43,470 --> 05:18:43,480
requested to go at a slower Pace but at
 

11305
05:18:43,480 --> 05:18:45,390
requested to go at a slower Pace but at
the same time I feel like if I if I went

11306
05:18:45,390 --> 05:18:45,400
the same time I feel like if I if I went
 

11307
05:18:45,400 --> 05:18:47,350
the same time I feel like if I if I went
with a slower Pace like once every two

11308
05:18:47,350 --> 05:18:47,360
with a slower Pace like once every two
 

11309
05:18:47,360 --> 05:18:49,070
with a slower Pace like once every two
weeks or so I probably still wouldn't

11310
05:18:49,070 --> 05:18:49,080
weeks or so I probably still wouldn't
 

11311
05:18:49,080 --> 05:18:51,670
weeks or so I probably still wouldn't
have gotten to really repeat on my own

11312
05:18:51,670 --> 05:18:51,680
have gotten to really repeat on my own
 

11313
05:18:51,680 --> 05:18:53,830
have gotten to really repeat on my own
time so in the end there would have been

11314
05:18:53,830 --> 05:18:53,840
time so in the end there would have been
 

11315
05:18:53,840 --> 05:18:55,910
time so in the end there would have been
more time to forget everything in

11316
05:18:55,910 --> 05:18:55,920
more time to forget everything in
 

11317
05:18:55,920 --> 05:18:57,190
more time to forget everything in
between

11318
05:18:57,190 --> 05:18:57,200
between
 

11319
05:18:57,200 --> 05:19:00,670
between
so probably once a week is better is the

11320
05:19:00,670 --> 05:19:00,680
so probably once a week is better is the
 

11321
05:19:00,680 --> 05:19:03,708
so probably once a week is better is the
minimum

11322
05:19:03,708 --> 05:19:03,718

 

11323
05:19:03,718 --> 05:19:05,830

honestly yeah it doesn't work any other
