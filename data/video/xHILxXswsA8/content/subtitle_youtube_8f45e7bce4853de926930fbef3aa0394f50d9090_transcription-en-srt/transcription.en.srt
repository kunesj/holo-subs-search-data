I started alone for 30 minutes and that
 

79
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,589

had to explode some things because

82
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:13,200
had to explode some things because
 

83
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,430
had to explode some things because
creepers were everywhere in the

84
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:15,440
creepers were everywhere in the
 

85
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:20,430
creepers were everywhere in the
beginning um and that resulted in some

86
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:20,440
beginning um and that resulted in some
 

87
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,069
beginning um and that resulted in some
issues here you may have noticed the

88
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:22,079
issues here you may have noticed the
 

89
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,629
issues here you may have noticed the
merchants and so on are gone yeah

90
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:24,639
merchants and so on are gone yeah
 

91
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,510
merchants and so on are gone yeah
they're all super dead yeah they were

92
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:26,520
they're all super dead yeah they were
 

93
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,270
they're all super dead yeah they were
eaten by zombies and this is a big

94
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:29,280
eaten by zombies and this is a big
 

95
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,110
eaten by zombies and this is a big
problem because we need Merchants

96
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:33,120
problem because we need Merchants
 

97
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,790

villagers again villagers so but the

98
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:36,800
villagers again villagers so but the
 

99
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,230
villagers again villagers so but the
thing is like they spawned only in

100
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:39,240
thing is like they spawned only in
 

101
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,710
thing is like they spawned only in
specific phases so our job yesterday was

102
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:42,720
specific phases so our job yesterday was
 

103
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,390
specific phases so our job yesterday was
we were in Phase seven and there were 10

104
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:45,400
we were in Phase seven and there were 10
 

105
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,749
we were in Phase seven and there were 10
so we were mining for hours those last

106
00:04:48,749 --> 00:04:48,759
so we were mining for hours those last
 

107
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:51,430
so we were mining for hours those last
three phases took a while um so that we

108
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:51,440
three phases took a while um so that we
 

109
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,189
three phases took a while um so that we
can Circle back but turns out it doesn't

110
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:53,199
can Circle back but turns out it doesn't
 

111
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,909
can Circle back but turns out it doesn't
Circle back it just like after 10 phases

112
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:55,919
Circle back it just like after 10 phases
 

113
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,790
Circle back it just like after 10 phases
it gives you all phases at once so the

114
00:04:59,790 --> 00:04:59,800
it gives you all phases at once so the
 

115
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,110
it gives you all phases at once so the
cool of blocks and things you can get

116
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:03,120
cool of blocks and things you can get
 

117
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,230
cool of blocks and things you can get
from mining now is way bigger than in a

118
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:06,240
from mining now is way bigger than in a
 

119
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,430
from mining now is way bigger than in a
single phase you know what I mean cuz

120
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:07,440
single phase you know what I mean cuz
 

121
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,510
single phase you know what I mean cuz
it's all phas is combined yeah yeah so

122
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:10,520
it's all phas is combined yeah yeah so
 

123
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,510
it's all phas is combined yeah yeah so
the chances of us getting what we really

124
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:12,520
the chances of us getting what we really
 

125
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,629
the chances of us getting what we really
want is lower now but at the same time

126
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:14,639
want is lower now but at the same time
 

127
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,990
want is lower now but at the same time
we can get

128
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:16,000
we can get
 

129
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,150
we can get
everything at once yeah um that's

130
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:19,160
everything at once yeah um that's
 

131
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,990
everything at once yeah um that's
chaotic as hell yeah and then uh we

132
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,000
chaotic as hell yeah and then uh we
 

133
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,550
chaotic as hell yeah and then uh we
noticed

134
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:23,560
noticed
 

135
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,150
noticed
um

136
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:25,160
um
 

137
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,990
um
some uh things uh that could be improved

138
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:29,000
some uh things uh that could be improved
 

139
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,469
some uh things uh that could be improved
here this is still the mining area this

140
00:05:31,469 --> 00:05:31,479
here this is still the mining area this
 

141
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:33,150
here this is still the mining area this
this block here uh in between the

142
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:33,160
this block here uh in between the
 

143
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,670
this block here uh in between the
chocolate blocks is the one you mine uh

144
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:36,680
chocolate blocks is the one you mine uh
 

145
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,510
chocolate blocks is the one you mine uh
I'm going to buil like something where

146
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:40,520
I'm going to buil like something where
 

147
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,550
I'm going to buil like something where
uh it goes immediately into a chest here

148
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:42,560
uh it goes immediately into a chest here
 

149
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,510
uh it goes immediately into a chest here
through the water oh so that our okay

150
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:45,520
through the water oh so that our okay
 

151
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,909
through the water oh so that our okay
what was the actual purpose I think

152
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:47,919
what was the actual purpose I think
 

153
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,550
what was the actual purpose I think
because our inventories were always full

154
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:50,560
because our inventories were always full
 

155
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,550
because our inventories were always full
I don't know I don't know anymore but

157
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,230
I don't know I don't know anymore but
yeah now it's looking really chocolatey

158
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:54,240
yeah now it's looking really chocolatey
 

159
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,189
yeah now it's looking really chocolatey
and nice and then you can like click on

160

and nice and then you can like click on
the chest here on the side and like

lot in there yeah cool I don't even know

168
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:05,639
lot in there yeah cool I don't even know
 

169
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:07,629
lot in there yeah cool I don't even know
how do people even get the mechanism

170
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:07,639
how do people even get the mechanism
 

171
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:09,790
how do people even get the mechanism
that's crazy oh she worked on a while on

172
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:09,800
that's crazy oh she worked on a while on
 

173

it yeah and then besides this
 

175
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,350
it yeah and then besides this
contraption we have another new one I

176
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:14,360
contraption we have another new one I
 

177
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,390
contraption we have another new one I
saw you already were standing here but

178
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:16,400
saw you already were standing here but
 

179
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,830
saw you already were standing here but
didn't notice what it was behind you

180
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:18,840
didn't notice what it was behind you
 

181
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,790
didn't notice what it was behind you
yeah yeah what is this this is a

182
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:20,800
yeah yeah what is this this is a
 

183
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,270
yeah yeah what is this this is a
cobblestone generator that uh go created

184
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:24,280
cobblestone generator that uh go created
 

185
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,189
cobblestone generator that uh go created
surprisingly she made

186
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:26,199
surprisingly she made
 

187
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:29,749
surprisingly she made
it wow basically I think maybe you know

188
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:29,759
it wow basically I think maybe you know
 

189
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,510
it wow basically I think maybe you know
that stone in between the lava and the

190
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:31,520
that stone in between the lava and the
 

191
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,430
that stone in between the lava and the
water you mine that and you get endless

192
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:34,440
water you mine that and you get endless
 

193
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,990
water you mine that and you get endless
Cobblestone try it yeah okay I think I

194
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:38,000
Cobblestone try it yeah okay I think I
 

195
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,589
Cobblestone try it yeah okay I think I
can actually see how it works cuz of the

196
00:06:39,589 --> 00:06:39,599
can actually see how it works cuz of the
 

197
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:42,830
can actually see how it works cuz of the
lava and water yeah it takes a second

198
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:42,840
lava and water yeah it takes a second
 

199
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,070
lava and water yeah it takes a second
but I feel like it gets faster yeah yeah

200
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:45,080
but I feel like it gets faster yeah yeah
 

201
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,790
but I feel like it gets faster yeah yeah
cool yeah why is it endless cob Stone

202
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:48,800
cool yeah why is it endless cob Stone
 

203
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,749
cool yeah why is it endless cob Stone
yeah so for like building if we need to

204
00:06:50,749 --> 00:06:50,759
yeah so for like building if we need to
 

205
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:54,550
yeah so for like building if we need to
build paths or whatever this is maybe a

206
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:54,560
build paths or whatever this is maybe a
 

207
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,950
build paths or whatever this is maybe a
good option and then there's some extra

208
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:56,960
good option and then there's some extra
 

209
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,110
good option and then there's some extra
Stacks in this chest here cool

210
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:00,120
Stacks in this chest here cool
 

211
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,790
Stacks in this chest here cool
are we able to replace the floor do you

212
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:01,800
are we able to replace the floor do you
 

213
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,110
are we able to replace the floor do you
think or is there floor we shouldn't

214
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,120
think or is there floor we shouldn't
 

215
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,230
think or is there floor we shouldn't
replace M oh generally it's always good

216
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:06,240
replace M oh generally it's always good
 

217
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,110
replace M oh generally it's always good
to for example replace these wooden

218
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:08,120
to for example replace these wooden
 

219
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,469
to for example replace these wooden
floors here Stone floors so that they

220

grassy blocks I would keep because we

226
00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:19,759
grassy blocks I would keep because we
 

227
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,869
grassy blocks I would keep because we
need some grassy blocks anyway to grow

228
00:07:22,869 --> 00:07:22,879
need some grassy blocks anyway to grow
 

229
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,150
need some grassy blocks anyway to grow

really thick yeah but when you when you
 

249
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,909
really thick yeah but when you when you
plant them if you happen to mine them

250
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:51,919
plant them if you happen to mine them
 

251
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,469
plant them if you happen to mine them
and you want to plant them again um like

252
00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:54,479
and you want to plant them again um like
 

253
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,589
and you want to plant them again um like
from the leaves they will drop the

254
00:07:56,589 --> 00:07:56,599
from the leaves they will drop the
 

255
00:07:56,599 --> 00:07:59,149
from the leaves they will drop the
little thingies right um but you have to

256
00:07:59,149 --> 00:07:59,159
little thingies right um but you have to
 

257
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:04,350
little thingies right um but you have to
plant this one in like like a four um

258
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:04,360
plant this one in like like a four um
 

259
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,110
plant this one in like like a four um
space thingy like 1 2 3 four um next to

260
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:08,120
space thingy like 1 2 3 four um next to
 

261
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,710
space thingy like 1 2 3 four um next to
each other uh you know what I mean uh

262
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:10,720
each other uh you know what I mean uh
 

263
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,189
each other uh you know what I mean uh
what's it called 4x4 yeah a 4x4 or

264
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:14,199
what's it called 4x4 yeah a 4x4 or
 

265
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:16,589
what's it called 4x4 yeah a 4x4 or
actually 2 by two but I for me it's like

266
00:08:16,589 --> 00:08:16,599
actually 2 by two but I for me it's like
 

267
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:20,029
actually 2 by two but I for me it's like
four because yeah 2 by two oh I get you

268
00:08:20,029 --> 00:08:20,039
four because yeah 2 by two oh I get you
 

269
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:22,110
four because yeah 2 by two oh I get you
yeah yeah yeah yeah I see why don't we

270
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:22,120
yeah yeah yeah yeah I see why don't we
 

271
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,629
yeah yeah yeah yeah I see why don't we
just plant a bunch of those I feel like

272
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:23,639
just plant a bunch of those I feel like
 

273
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:25,430
just plant a bunch of those I feel like
that's most efficient well we don't even

274
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:25,440
that's most efficient well we don't even
 

275
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,149
that's most efficient well we don't even
have that much space you see it's

276
00:08:27,149 --> 00:08:27,159
have that much space you see it's
 

277
00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:29,589
have that much space you see it's
already pretty cramped if we can get

278
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:29,599
already pretty cramped if we can get
 

279
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,949
already pretty cramped if we can get
this uh area extended extend it yeah

280
00:08:32,949 --> 00:08:32,959
this uh area extended extend it yeah
 

281
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:34,670
this uh area extended extend it yeah
that would be fine but we don't have

282
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:34,680
that would be fine but we don't have
 

283
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,110
that would be fine but we don't have
that many dirt blocks either true I wish

284
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:38,120
that many dirt blocks either true I wish
 

285
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,589
that many dirt blocks either true I wish
we could generate dirt blocks

286
00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:40,599
we could generate dirt blocks
 

287
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:44,630
we could generate dirt blocks
yeah well grass grown a few yeah that's

288
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:44,640
yeah well grass grown a few yeah that's
 

289
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,389
yeah well grass grown a few yeah that's
all all maybe I can go find some dirt

290
00:08:47,389 --> 00:08:47,399
all all maybe I can go find some dirt
 

291
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:49,790
all all maybe I can go find some dirt
blocks around place I don't even think

292
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:49,800
blocks around place I don't even think
 

293
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,750
blocks around place I don't even think
this takes priority um I think yeah uh

294
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:53,760
this takes priority um I think yeah uh
 

295
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,550
this takes priority um I think yeah uh
the Sorting for now takes priority also

296
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:57,560
the Sorting for now takes priority also
 

297
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,389
the Sorting for now takes priority also

okay let's see I really want to mine for

1310
00:32:11,789 --> 00:32:11,799
okay let's see I really want to mine for
 

1311
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:14,269
okay let's see I really want to mine for
some diamonds we need to this is

1312
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:14,279
some diamonds we need to this is
 

1313
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:16,950
some diamonds we need to this is
actually really ridiculous and mine for

1314
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:16,960
actually really ridiculous and mine for
 

1315
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,710
actually really ridiculous and mine for
diamonds that's just mining at that

1316
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:18,720
diamonds that's just mining at that
 

1317
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,870
diamonds that's just mining at that
block over there but don't worry about

1318
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:20,880
block over there but don't worry about
 

1319
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,389
block over there but don't worry about
mining right now yeah cuz now like

1320
00:32:23,389 --> 00:32:23,399
mining right now yeah cuz now like
 

1321
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:25,509
mining right now yeah cuz now like
there's how many blocks is it that you

1322
00:32:25,509 --> 00:32:25,519
there's how many blocks is it that you
 

1323
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,509
there's how many blocks is it that you
could get out of that it's the 10 phases

1324
00:32:27,509 --> 00:32:27,519
could get out of that it's the 10 phases
 

1325
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:30,350
could get out of that it's the 10 phases
combined it's like everything so the

1326
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:30,360
combined it's like everything so the
 

1327
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,669
combined it's like everything so the
chance to get diamonds is pretty low

1328
00:32:32,669 --> 00:32:32,679
chance to get diamonds is pretty low
 

1329
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:34,990
chance to get diamonds is pretty low
now that is true I guess the best thing

1330
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:35,000
now that is true I guess the best thing
 

1331
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,710
now that is true I guess the best thing
I can do is just try to organize as much

1332
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:36,720
I can do is just try to organize as much
 

1333
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,230
I can do is just try to organize as much
as I can so we can keep mining yeah um

1334
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:40,240
as I can so we can keep mining yeah um
 

1335
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,310

reasons of why it could have happened
 

5681
02:18:42,760 --> 02:18:43,790
reasons of why it could have happened
but it's kind of interesting there's

5682
02:18:43,790 --> 02:18:43,800
but it's kind of interesting there's
 

5683
02:18:43,800 --> 02:18:46,030
but it's kind of interesting there's
this like documentary in German that I

5684
02:18:46,030 --> 02:18:46,040
this like documentary in German that I
 

5685
02:18:46,040 --> 02:18:49,150
this like documentary in German that I
watched about it oh shouldn't they have

5686
02:18:49,150 --> 02:18:49,160
watched about it oh shouldn't they have
 

5687
02:18:49,160 --> 02:18:51,429
watched about it oh shouldn't they have
done a gajillion different check

5688
02:18:51,429 --> 02:18:51,439
done a gajillion different check
 

5689
02:18:51,439 --> 02:18:53,389
done a gajillion different check
they they always do and like it was

5690
02:18:53,389 --> 02:18:53,399
they they always do and like it was
 

5691
02:18:53,399 --> 02:18:55,790
they they always do and like it was
supposed to be super secure but you know

5692
02:18:55,790 --> 02:18:55,800
supposed to be super secure but you know
 

5693
02:18:55,800 --> 02:18:57,309
supposed to be super secure but you know
and then the question was are they going

5694
02:18:57,309 --> 02:18:57,319
and then the question was are they going
 

5695
02:18:57,319 --> 02:18:59,469
and then the question was are they going
to rebuild it or not because like this

5696
02:18:59,469 --> 02:18:59,479
to rebuild it or not because like this
 

5697
02:18:59,479 --> 02:19:01,070
to rebuild it or not because like this
should never happen again it was kind of

5698
02:19:01,070 --> 02:19:01,080
should never happen again it was kind of
 

5699
02:19:01,080 --> 02:19:03,469
should never happen again it was kind of
ridiculous in the first place and so

5700
02:19:03,469 --> 02:19:03,479
ridiculous in the first place and so
 

5701
02:19:03,479 --> 02:19:04,910
ridiculous in the first place and so
they decided to not rebuild it and

5702
02:19:04,910 --> 02:19:04,920
they decided to not rebuild it and
 

5703
02:19:04,920 --> 02:19:06,870
they decided to not rebuild it and
that's the right choice because how

5704
02:19:06,870 --> 02:19:06,880
that's the right choice because how
 

5705
02:19:06,880 --> 02:19:08,910
that's the right choice because how
could you after killing thousands of
