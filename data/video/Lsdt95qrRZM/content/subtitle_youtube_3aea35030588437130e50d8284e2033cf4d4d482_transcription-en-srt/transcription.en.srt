2651
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:01,750
oh [\h__\h] didn't look at that
should we just like build this way at

2652
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:01,760
should we just like build this way at
 

2653
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:05,030
should we just like build this way at
least one floor should work

2654
01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:05,040

instead
so at least like this level can have

2664
01:01:14,710 --> 01:01:14,720
so at least like this level can have
 

2665
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:18,230
so at least like this level can have
like two story

2876
01:06:07,670 --> 01:06:07,680
and then what do we need to make
 

2877
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:10,549
and then what do we need to make
i need to make a roof

2878
01:06:10,549 --> 01:06:10,559
i need to make a roof
 

2879
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:12,630
i need to make a roof
there's a roof option too

2880
01:06:12,630 --> 01:06:12,640
there's a roof option too
 

2881
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:14,710
there's a roof option too
there's a roof option but most people

2882
01:06:14,710 --> 01:06:14,720
there's a roof option but most people
 

2883
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:18,470
there's a roof option but most people
just put a flat roof aka just a floor

2884
01:06:18,470 --> 01:06:18,480
just put a flat roof aka just a floor
 

2885
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,390
just put a flat roof aka just a floor
because roofing is kind of difficult i

2886
01:06:20,390 --> 01:06:20,400
because roofing is kind of difficult i
 

2887
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:21,750

01:45:34,229 --> 01:45:34,239
this is enough i don't know okay then
 

4661
01:45:34,239 --> 01:45:36,070
this is enough i don't know okay then
recycle that and then i'll also recycle

4662
01:45:36,070 --> 01:45:36,080
recycle that and then i'll also recycle
 

4663
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:40,310
recycle that and then i'll also recycle
something okay

4664
01:45:40,310 --> 01:45:40,320

 

4665
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:41,669

and then you already got some nice

4666
01:45:41,669 --> 01:45:41,679
and then you already got some nice
 

4667
01:45:41,679 --> 01:45:44,390
and then you already got some nice
scraps yay

4668
01:45:44,390 --> 01:45:44,400
scraps yay
 

4669
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:47,830
scraps yay
what are what are scraps for by the way

4670
01:45:47,830 --> 01:45:47,840
what are what are scraps for by the way
 

4671
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:51,030
what are what are scraps for by the way
yeah as i said um

4672
01:45:51,030 --> 01:45:51,040

 

4673
01:45:51,040 --> 01:45:54,149

the only use that i know at the moment

4674
01:45:54,149 --> 01:45:54,159
the only use that i know at the moment
 

4675
01:45:54,159 --> 01:45:55,350
the only use that i know at the moment
is that

4676
01:45:55,350 --> 01:45:55,360
is that
 

4677
01:45:55,360 --> 01:45:57,669
is that
when you get a workbench

4678
01:45:57,669 --> 01:45:57,679
when you get a workbench
 

4679
01:45:57,679 --> 01:46:02,870
when you get a workbench
then there's like a a tree of recipes

4680
01:46:02,870 --> 01:46:02,880
then there's like a a tree of recipes
 

4681
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:04,550
then there's like a a tree of recipes
that you can learn

4682
01:46:04,550 --> 01:46:04,560
that you can learn
 

4683
01:46:04,560 --> 01:46:06,709
that you can learn
um to craft more things like you can

4684
01:46:06,709 --> 01:46:06,719
um to craft more things like you can
 

4685
01:46:06,719 --> 01:46:09,350
um to craft more things like you can
craft weapons you can craft stuff for

4686
01:46:09,350 --> 01:46:09,360
craft weapons you can craft stuff for
 

4687
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:11,910
craft weapons you can craft stuff for
your house you can craft clothes and all

4688
01:46:11,910 --> 01:46:11,920
your house you can craft clothes and all
 

4689
01:46:11,920 --> 01:46:13,830
your house you can craft clothes and all
that

4690
01:46:13,830 --> 01:46:13,840
that
 

4691
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:15,590
that
but i guess you can also gamble with

4692
01:46:15,590 --> 01:46:15,600
but i guess you can also gamble with
 

4693
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:17,350
but i guess you can also gamble with
them

4694
01:46:17,350 --> 01:46:17,360
them
 

4695
01:46:17,360 --> 01:46:19,510
them
okay

4696
01:46:19,510 --> 01:46:19,520
okay
 

4697
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:21,030
okay
did you

4698
01:46:21,030 --> 01:46:21,040
did you
 

4699
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:23,669
did you
did it what did you take what's uh there

4700
01:46:23,669 --> 01:46:23,679
did it what did you take what's uh there
 

4701
01:46:23,679 --> 01:46:27,590
did it what did you take what's uh there
and what what what it dropped here no

4702
01:46:27,590 --> 01:46:27,600
and what what what it dropped here no
 

4703
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:29,510
and what what what it dropped here no
i don't know

4704
01:46:29,510 --> 01:46:29,520
i don't know
 

4705
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:32,550
i don't know
take it okay

4707
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:36,790

it's valuable

4708
01:46:36,790 --> 01:46:36,800

 

4709
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:39,750

you can save crafts by building a

you can save crafts by building a
 

4733
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:08,390
you can save crafts by building a
research table for blueprints

4734

research table for blueprints
 

4735
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:10,950

okay okay okay okay okay

4736
01:47:10,950 --> 01:47:10,960
okay okay okay okay okay
 

4737
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:13,270
okay okay okay okay okay
that's useful

4738
01:47:13,270 --> 01:47:13,280
that's useful
 

4739
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:15,189
that's useful
that's useful knowledge you can make a

4740
01:47:15,189 --> 01:47:15,199
that's useful knowledge you can make a
 

4741
01:47:15,199 --> 01:47:17,109
that's useful knowledge you can make a
blueprint from the smg and then you can

4742
01:47:17,109 --> 01:47:17,119
blueprint from the smg and then you can
 

4743
01:47:17,119 --> 01:47:19,270
blueprint from the smg and then you can
make it yourself they're saying

4744
01:47:19,270 --> 01:47:19,280
make it yourself they're saying
 

4745
01:47:19,280 --> 01:47:23,750
make it yourself they're saying
exactly how do i make a blueprint

4746
01:47:23,750 --> 01:47:23,760

 

4747
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:25,510

well you already have the the blueprint

4748
01:47:25,510 --> 01:47:25,520
well you already have the the blueprint
 

4749
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:28,709
well you already have the the blueprint
thingy but um what they mean is probably

4750
01:47:28,709 --> 01:47:28,719
thingy but um what they mean is probably
 

4751
01:47:28,719 --> 01:47:31,430
thingy but um what they mean is probably
when you make the workbench

4752
01:47:31,430 --> 01:47:31,440
when you make the workbench
 

4753
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:33,750
when you make the workbench
there's many many many recipes you can

4754
01:47:33,750 --> 01:47:33,760
there's many many many recipes you can
 

4755
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:36,310
there's many many many recipes you can
learn but in order to unlock them you

4756
01:47:36,310 --> 01:47:36,320
learn but in order to unlock them you
 

4757
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:39,030
learn but in order to unlock them you
need scraps lots of scraps a lot of

4758
01:47:39,030 --> 01:47:39,040
need scraps lots of scraps a lot of
 

4759
01:47:39,040 --> 01:47:41,109
need scraps lots of scraps a lot of
scrubs so that's what we gotta make

4760
01:47:41,109 --> 01:47:41,119
scrubs so that's what we gotta make
 

4761
01:47:41,119 --> 01:47:44,149
scrubs so that's what we gotta make

that's what you should make next you can
 

4767
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:51,590
that's what you should make next you can
