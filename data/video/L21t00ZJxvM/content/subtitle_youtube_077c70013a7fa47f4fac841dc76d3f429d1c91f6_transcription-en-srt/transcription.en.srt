but he doesn't react right away right
 

11641
04:59:11,360 --> 04:59:13,190
but he doesn't react right away right
when you climb up so

11642
04:59:13,190 --> 04:59:13,200
when you climb up so
 

11643
04:59:13,200 --> 04:59:15,830
when you climb up so

you climb up a little bit you throw
 

11645
04:59:15,840 --> 04:59:16,628
you climb up a little bit you throw
him

11646
04:59:16,628 --> 04:59:16,638
him
 

11647
04:59:16,638 --> 04:59:18,868
him
um a

11648
04:59:18,868 --> 04:59:18,878
um a
 

11649
04:59:18,878 --> 04:59:19,990
um a
decoy

11650
04:59:19,990 --> 04:59:20,000
decoy
 

11651
04:59:20,000 --> 04:59:22,708
decoy
we use we never used that item but

11652
04:59:22,708 --> 04:59:22,718
we use we never used that item but
 

11653
04:59:22,718 --> 04:59:27,830
we use we never used that item but
what happens is a little you runs around

11654
04:59:27,830 --> 04:59:27,840
what happens is a little you runs around
 

11655
04:59:27,840 --> 04:59:28,948
what happens is a little you runs around
and

11656
04:59:28,948 --> 04:59:28,958
and
 

11657
04:59:28,958 --> 04:59:31,750
and
yeah so when you throw it immediately

11658
04:59:31,750 --> 04:59:31,760
yeah so when you throw it immediately
 

11659
04:59:31,760 --> 04:59:36,708
yeah so when you throw it immediately
you climb the ladder back down again

11660
04:59:36,708 --> 04:59:36,718

 

11661
04:59:36,718 --> 04:59:41,190

oh we have more wood even

11662
04:59:41,190 --> 04:59:41,200

 

11663
04:59:41,200 --> 04:59:42,470

and that

11664
04:59:42,470 --> 04:59:42,480
and that
 

11665
04:59:42,480 --> 04:59:44,150
and that
i don't know it's

11666
04:59:44,150 --> 04:59:44,160
i don't know it's
 

11667
04:59:44,160 --> 04:59:46,708
i don't know it's
some kind of glitch or bug happens

11668
04:59:46,708 --> 04:59:46,718
some kind of glitch or bug happens
 

11669
04:59:46,718 --> 04:59:47,830
some kind of glitch or bug happens
there's

11670
04:59:47,830 --> 04:59:47,840
there's
 

11671
04:59:47,840 --> 04:59:51,430
there's
they said something about

11672
04:59:51,430 --> 04:59:51,440

 

11673
04:59:51,440 --> 04:59:51,850

um

11674
04:59:51,850 --> 04:59:51,860
um
 

11675
04:59:51,860 --> 04:59:53,270
um
[Music]

11676
04:59:53,270 --> 04:59:53,280
[Music]
 

11677
04:59:53,280 --> 04:59:54,708
[Music]
i didn't know that term but apparently

11678
04:59:54,708 --> 04:59:54,718
i didn't know that term but apparently
 

11679
04:59:54,718 --> 04:59:58,470
i didn't know that term but apparently
it's some kind of

11680
04:59:58,470 --> 04:59:58,480

 

11681
04:59:58,480 --> 05:00:01,110

game developing term

11682
05:00:01,110 --> 05:00:01,120
game developing term
 

11683
05:00:01,120 --> 05:00:02,868
game developing term
uh

11684
05:00:02,868 --> 05:00:02,878
uh
 

11685
05:00:02,878 --> 05:00:04,948
uh
like some kind of kill wall or something

11686
05:00:04,948 --> 05:00:04,958
like some kind of kill wall or something
 

11687
05:00:04,958 --> 05:00:07,270
like some kind of kill wall or something
like that

11688
05:00:07,270 --> 05:00:07,280
like that
 

11689
05:00:07,280 --> 05:00:09,750
like that
wait where you

11690
05:00:09,750 --> 05:00:09,760
wait where you
 

11691
05:00:09,760 --> 05:00:12,310
wait where you
what was it i didn't quite understand it

11692
05:00:12,310 --> 05:00:12,320
what was it i didn't quite understand it
 

11693
05:00:12,320 --> 05:00:13,830
what was it i didn't quite understand it
so it's hard to

11694
05:00:13,830 --> 05:00:13,840
so it's hard to
 

11695
05:00:13,840 --> 05:00:15,350
so it's hard to
repeat it

11696
05:00:15,350 --> 05:00:15,360
repeat it
 

11697
05:00:15,360 --> 05:00:16,470
repeat it
um

11698
05:00:16,470 --> 05:00:16,480
um
 

11699
05:00:16,480 --> 05:00:19,590
um
but something happens when you

11700
05:00:19,590 --> 05:00:19,600
but something happens when you
 

11701
05:00:19,600 --> 05:00:21,670
but something happens when you
go back down

11702
05:00:21,670 --> 05:00:21,680
go back down
 

11703
05:00:21,680 --> 05:00:23,910
go back down
the

11704
05:00:23,910 --> 05:00:23,920

 

11705
05:00:23,920 --> 05:00:26,708

um the ladder like basically you throw

11706
05:00:26,708 --> 05:00:26,718
um the ladder like basically you throw
 

11707
05:00:26,718 --> 05:00:29,910
um the ladder like basically you throw
the the decoy to activate

11708
05:00:29,910 --> 05:00:29,920
the the decoy to activate
 

11709
05:00:29,920 --> 05:00:31,110
the the decoy to activate
him

11710
05:00:31,110 --> 05:00:31,120
him
 

11711
05:00:31,120 --> 05:00:32,948
him
but still have enough time to

11712
05:00:32,948 --> 05:00:32,958
but still have enough time to
 

11713
05:00:32,958 --> 05:00:34,708
but still have enough time to
go down i guess because i wonder if if

11714
05:00:34,708 --> 05:00:34,718
go down i guess because i wonder if if
 

11715
05:00:34,718 --> 05:00:36,628
go down i guess because i wonder if if
you activate the fight normally if you

11716
05:00:36,628 --> 05:00:36,638
you activate the fight normally if you
 

11717
05:00:36,638 --> 05:00:44,708
you activate the fight normally if you
would be able to actually um

11718
05:00:44,708 --> 05:00:44,718

 

11719
05:00:44,718 --> 05:00:46,788

to still go down i don't think so they

11720
05:00:46,788 --> 05:00:46,798
to still go down i don't think so they
 

11721
05:00:46,798 --> 05:00:49,590
to still go down i don't think so they
probably blocked the ladder no

11722
05:00:49,590 --> 05:00:49,600
probably blocked the ladder no
 

11723
05:00:49,600 --> 05:00:51,750
probably blocked the ladder no
so you do it in a timing that's very

11724
05:00:51,750 --> 05:00:51,760
so you do it in a timing that's very
 

11725
05:00:51,760 --> 05:00:53,510
so you do it in a timing that's very
important so that you still have time to

11726
05:00:53,510 --> 05:00:53,520
important so that you still have time to
 

11727
05:00:53,520 --> 05:00:55,590
important so that you still have time to
go down before

11728
05:00:55,590 --> 05:00:55,600
go down before
 

11729
05:00:55,600 --> 05:00:58,310
go down before
we before having the librarian come to

11730
05:00:58,310 --> 05:00:58,320
we before having the librarian come to
 

11731
05:00:58,320 --> 05:01:01,350
we before having the librarian come to
live basically but yeah throw the decoy

11732
05:01:01,350 --> 05:01:01,360
live basically but yeah throw the decoy
 

11733
05:01:01,360 --> 05:01:03,830
live basically but yeah throw the decoy
then go down and then when you walk down

11734
05:01:03,830 --> 05:01:03,840
then go down and then when you walk down
 

11735
05:01:03,840 --> 05:01:06,230
then go down and then when you walk down
the stair the the ladder climb down the

11736
05:01:06,230 --> 05:01:06,240
the stair the the ladder climb down the
 

11737
05:01:06,240 --> 05:01:07,670
the stair the the ladder climb down the
ladder

11738
05:01:07,670 --> 05:01:07,680
ladder
 

11739
05:01:07,680 --> 05:01:11,110
ladder
the librarian im immediately instantly

05:01:14,628 --> 05:01:14,638
dies by some kind of mechanic there
 

11743
05:01:14,638 --> 05:01:16,868
dies by some kind of mechanic there
that's the thing that the term that they

11744
05:01:16,868 --> 05:01:16,878
that's the thing that the term that they
 

11745
05:01:16,878 --> 05:01:19,270
that's the thing that the term that they
mentioned that i just don't

11746
05:01:19,270 --> 05:01:19,280
mentioned that i just don't
 

11747
05:01:19,280 --> 05:01:20,788
mentioned that i just don't
remember what it was but it's very

11748
05:01:20,788 --> 05:01:20,798
remember what it was but it's very
 

11749
05:01:20,798 --> 05:01:22,310
remember what it was but it's very
interesting that there is such thing

11750
05:01:22,310 --> 05:01:22,320
interesting that there is such thing
 

11751
05:01:22,320 --> 05:01:24,550
interesting that there is such thing
apparently every boss has that or every

11752
05:01:24,550 --> 05:01:24,560
apparently every boss has that or every
 

11753
05:01:24,560 --> 05:01:27,510
apparently every boss has that or every
every enemy maybe that's what yeah the

that word before
 

11759
05:01:30,878 --> 05:01:33,990
that word before
is that a thing

11760
05:01:33,990 --> 05:01:34,000

 

11761
05:01:34,000 --> 05:01:35,350

a few names were that's what i mean

11769
05:01:44,320 --> 05:01:47,670

is that when you go out of bounds

11770
05:01:47,670 --> 05:01:47,680
is that when you go out of bounds
 

11771
05:01:47,680 --> 05:01:50,390
is that when you go out of bounds
but but it's it's isn't is that still

11772
05:01:50,390 --> 05:01:50,400
but but it's it's isn't is that still
 

11773
05:01:50,400 --> 05:01:53,590
but but it's it's isn't is that still
considered exploitation though or glitch

11774
05:01:53,590 --> 05:01:53,600
considered exploitation though or glitch
 

11775
05:01:53,600 --> 05:01:55,270
considered exploitation though or glitch
is it considered a glitch i guess not

11776
05:01:55,270 --> 05:01:55,280
is it considered a glitch i guess not
 

11777
05:01:55,280 --> 05:01:57,750
is it considered a glitch i guess not
because they implement it there's a word

11778
05:01:57,750 --> 05:01:57,760
because they implement it there's a word
 

11779
05:01:57,760 --> 05:02:00,788
because they implement it there's a word
for it

11780
05:02:00,788 --> 05:02:00,798

 

11781
05:02:00,798 --> 05:02:03,910

i need to do some research

11782
05:02:03,910 --> 05:02:03,920
i need to do some research
 

11783
05:02:03,920 --> 05:02:06,310
i need to do some research
but the fact that it's possible

11784
05:02:06,310 --> 05:02:06,320
but the fact that it's possible
 

11785
05:02:06,320 --> 05:02:08,390
but the fact that it's possible
that the enemy is automatically killed

11786
05:02:08,390 --> 05:02:08,400
that the enemy is automatically killed
 

11787
05:02:08,400 --> 05:02:10,070
that the enemy is automatically killed
if you leave the field even though that

11788
05:02:10,070 --> 05:02:10,080
if you leave the field even though that
 

11789
05:02:10,080 --> 05:02:12,150
if you leave the field even though that
should that itself shouldn't be possible

11790
05:02:12,150 --> 05:02:12,160
should that itself shouldn't be possible
 

11791
05:02:12,160 --> 05:02:13,670
should that itself shouldn't be possible
in the first place that you leave the

11792
05:02:13,670 --> 05:02:13,680
in the first place that you leave the
 

11793
05:02:13,680 --> 05:02:15,190
in the first place that you leave the
field

11794

05:06:46,390 --> 05:06:46,400
a fountain
 

11997
05:06:46,400 --> 05:06:48,550
a fountain
that looks cool

11998
05:06:48,550 --> 05:06:48,560
that looks cool
 

11999
05:06:48,560 --> 05:06:56,628
that looks cool
it's a decoration item but i like it

12000
05:06:56,628 --> 05:06:56,638

 

12001
05:06:56,638 --> 05:06:58,628

more than that that it was used before

12002
05:06:58,628 --> 05:06:58,638
more than that that it was used before
 

12003
05:06:58,638 --> 05:07:00,150
more than that that it was used before
so they don't want to fix it and

12004
05:07:00,150 --> 05:07:00,160
so they don't want to fix it and
 

12005
05:07:00,160 --> 05:07:01,750
so they don't want to fix it and
sometimes it also just costs more time

12006
05:07:01,750 --> 05:07:01,760
sometimes it also just costs more time
 

12007
05:07:01,760 --> 05:07:07,670
sometimes it also just costs more time
to pick something then just leave it in

12008
05:07:07,670 --> 05:07:07,680

 

12009
05:07:07,680 --> 05:07:10,070

i want to try speed running it but it

12010
05:07:10,070 --> 05:07:10,080
i want to try speed running it but it
 

12011
05:07:10,080 --> 05:07:12,230
i want to try speed running it but it
would take up a lot of my time

12012
05:07:12,230 --> 05:07:12,240
would take up a lot of my time
 

12013
05:07:12,240 --> 05:07:14,390
would take up a lot of my time
i mean as i said i don't think it's as

12014

i mean as i said i don't think it's as
 

12015
05:07:14,400 --> 05:07:17,270
i mean as i said i don't think it's as
difficult as speedrunning uh super mario

12016
05:07:17,270 --> 05:07:17,280
difficult as speedrunning uh super mario
 

12017
05:07:17,280 --> 05:07:20,788
difficult as speedrunning uh super mario
64 for example

12018
05:07:20,788 --> 05:07:20,798
64 for example
 

12019
05:07:20,798 --> 05:07:21,590
64 for example
but

12020
05:07:21,590 --> 05:07:21,600
but
 

12021
05:07:21,600 --> 05:07:22,948
but
it's still

12022
05:07:22,948 --> 05:07:22,958
it's still
 

12023
05:07:22,958 --> 05:07:27,110
it's still
something that takes a lot of practice

12024
05:07:27,110 --> 05:07:27,120

 

12025
05:07:27,120 --> 05:07:29,430

i wonder i could at least attempt it and

12026
05:07:29,430 --> 05:07:29,440
i wonder i could at least attempt it and
 

12027
05:07:29,440 --> 05:07:31,350
i wonder i could at least attempt it and
see how difficult it actually is the

12028
05:07:31,350 --> 05:07:31,360
see how difficult it actually is the
 

12029
05:07:31,360 --> 05:07:35,430
see how difficult it actually is the
decoy thing is definitely easy

12030
05:07:35,430 --> 05:07:35,440
decoy thing is definitely easy
 

12031
05:07:35,440 --> 05:07:37,990
decoy thing is definitely easy
and honestly the scavenger explorer

12032
05:07:37,990 --> 05:07:38,000
and honestly the scavenger explorer
 

12033
05:07:38,000 --> 05:07:40,230
and honestly the scavenger explorer
seems super easy too

12034
05:07:40,230 --> 05:07:40,240
seems super easy too
 

12035
05:07:40,240 --> 05:07:45,510
seems super easy too
the one difficult thing i can see is um

12036
05:07:45,510 --> 05:07:45,520
the one difficult thing i can see is um
 

12037
05:07:45,520 --> 05:07:49,110
the one difficult thing i can see is um
they didn't really exploit the

12038
05:07:49,110 --> 05:07:49,120
they didn't really exploit the
 

12039
05:07:49,120 --> 05:07:51,670
they didn't really exploit the
last bus

12040
05:07:51,670 --> 05:07:51,680
last bus
 

12041
05:07:51,680 --> 05:07:53,590
last bus
they just um

12042
05:07:53,590 --> 05:07:53,600
they just um
 

12043
05:07:53,600 --> 05:07:55,750
they just um
kind of just you know kept on stunning

12044
05:07:55,750 --> 05:07:55,760
kind of just you know kept on stunning
 

12045
05:07:55,760 --> 05:07:58,150
kind of just you know kept on stunning
her like stan locking her

12046
05:07:58,150 --> 05:07:58,160
her like stan locking her
 

12047
05:07:58,160 --> 05:08:00,628
her like stan locking her
so they kind of did a proper battle but

12048
05:08:00,628 --> 05:08:00,638
so they kind of did a proper battle but
 

12049
05:08:00,638 --> 05:08:02,470
so they kind of did a proper battle but
they used that combination that we

12050
05:08:02,470 --> 05:08:02,480
they used that combination that we
 

12051
05:08:02,480 --> 05:08:04,628
they used that combination that we
learned about that i just couldn't get

12052
05:08:04,628 --> 05:08:04,638
learned about that i just couldn't get
 

12053
05:08:04,638 --> 05:08:06,150
learned about that i just couldn't get
right

12054
05:08:06,150 --> 05:08:06,160
right
 

12055
05:08:06,160 --> 05:08:07,830
right
so i would have to practice that a

12056
05:08:07,830 --> 05:08:07,840
so i would have to practice that a
 

12057
05:08:07,840 --> 05:08:13,110
so i would have to practice that a
million times

12058
