a lot of like resources if I ask for a
 

4645
02:00:33,719 --> 02:00:36,350
a lot of like resources if I ask for a
controller and then I would probably

4646
02:00:36,350 --> 02:00:36,360
controller and then I would probably
 

4647
02:00:36,360 --> 02:00:39,169
controller and then I would probably
have to give up on for example and a new

4648
02:00:39,169 --> 02:00:39,179
have to give up on for example and a new
 

4649

hairstyle like an extra hairstyle and
 

4651
02:00:41,460 --> 02:00:43,430
hairstyle like an extra hairstyle and
then I'd always prefer to have a second

4652
02:00:43,430 --> 02:00:43,440
then I'd always prefer to have a second
 

4653
02:00:43,440 --> 02:00:46,370
then I'd always prefer to have a second
hairstyle over a controller which I can

4654
02:00:46,370 --> 02:00:46,380
hairstyle over a controller which I can
 

4655
02:00:46,380 --> 02:00:48,950

02:03:50,580 --> 02:03:57,530

dangerous dangerous

4784
02:03:57,530 --> 02:03:57,540

funnier I think the fact that it's just
 

4801
02:04:17,340 --> 02:04:20,089
funnier I think the fact that it's just
a scuffed PNG on top of her makes it

4802
02:04:20,089 --> 02:04:20,099
a scuffed PNG on top of her makes it
 

4803
02:04:20,099 --> 02:04:26,510
a scuffed PNG on top of her makes it
funnier right

4804
02:04:26,510 --> 02:04:26,520

 

4805
02:04:26,520 --> 02:04:30,350

nope nope minus 41. if I go lower than

5082
02:11:51,290 --> 02:11:51,300
nope nope minus 41. if I go lower than
 

5083
02:11:51,300 --> 02:11:53,689
nope nope minus 41. if I go lower than
minus 50 are the chances for diamonds

5084
02:11:53,689 --> 02:11:53,699
minus 50 are the chances for diamonds
 

5085
02:11:53,699 --> 02:11:55,790
minus 50 are the chances for diamonds
much lower

5086
02:11:55,790 --> 02:11:55,800
much lower
 

5087
02:11:55,800 --> 02:12:03,109
much lower

man
 

8891
03:50:48,600 --> 03:50:56,150
man
maybe maybe

8892
03:50:56,150 --> 03:50:56,160

 

8893
03:50:56,160 --> 03:50:58,250

all the ups and downs you know they're

8894
03:50:58,250 --> 03:50:58,260
all the ups and downs you know they're
 

8895
03:50:58,260 --> 03:51:00,110
all the ups and downs you know they're
they were all necessary to eventually

8896
03:51:00,110 --> 03:51:00,120
they were all necessary to eventually
 

8897
03:51:00,120 --> 03:51:11,269
they were all necessary to eventually
lead to this moment you know

8898
03:51:11,269 --> 03:51:11,279

 

8899
03:51:11,279 --> 03:51:12,950

to Japan for the first time I already

8900
03:51:12,950 --> 03:51:12,960
to Japan for the first time I already
 

8901
03:51:12,960 --> 03:51:15,290
to Japan for the first time I already
spoke pretty good Japanese so I I

8902
03:51:15,290 --> 03:51:15,300
spoke pretty good Japanese so I I
 

8903
03:51:15,300 --> 03:51:17,030
spoke pretty good Japanese so I I
couldn't necessarily say that I wouldn't

8904
03:51:17,030 --> 03:51:17,040
couldn't necessarily say that I wouldn't
 

8905
03:51:17,040 --> 03:51:19,130
couldn't necessarily say that I wouldn't
have picked up that skill

8906
03:51:19,130 --> 03:51:19,140
have picked up that skill
 

8907
03:51:19,140 --> 03:51:22,790
have picked up that skill
if it wasn't for me failing Art School

8908
03:51:22,790 --> 03:51:22,800
if it wasn't for me failing Art School
 

8909
03:51:22,800 --> 03:51:26,210
if it wasn't for me failing Art School
or leaving art school but if I wouldn't

8910
03:51:26,210 --> 03:51:26,220
or leaving art school but if I wouldn't
 

8911
03:51:26,220 --> 03:51:27,769
or leaving art school but if I wouldn't
have left art school and finished it

8912
03:51:27,769 --> 03:51:27,779
have left art school and finished it
 

8913
03:51:27,779 --> 03:51:30,050
have left art school and finished it
properly

8914
03:51:30,050 --> 03:51:30,060
properly
 

8915
03:51:30,060 --> 03:51:32,450
properly
yeah yeah things would have been very

8916
03:51:32,450 --> 03:51:32,460
yeah yeah things would have been very
 

8917
03:51:32,460 --> 03:51:35,510
yeah yeah things would have been very
different I think

8918
03:51:35,510 --> 03:51:35,520

 

8919
03:51:35,520 --> 03:51:37,910

um

8920
03:51:37,910 --> 03:51:37,920

 

8921
03:51:37,920 --> 03:51:40,190

still had an interest in Japan and so on

8922
03:51:40,190 --> 03:51:40,200
still had an interest in Japan and so on
 

8923
03:51:40,200 --> 03:51:41,990
still had an interest in Japan and so on
and so eventually maybe I would have

8924
03:51:41,990 --> 03:51:42,000
and so eventually maybe I would have
 

8925
03:51:42,000 --> 03:51:44,809
and so eventually maybe I would have
tried to do the working holiday

8926
03:51:44,809 --> 03:51:44,819
tried to do the working holiday
 

8927
03:51:44,819 --> 03:51:46,540
tried to do the working holiday
nonetheless

8928
03:51:46,540 --> 03:51:46,550
nonetheless
 

8929
03:51:46,550 --> 03:51:49,610

8947
03:52:11,279 --> 03:52:14,870

helped me much in life

8952
03:52:19,670 --> 03:52:19,680
helped me much in life
 

8953

um
anyway now

9002
03:53:22,670 --> 03:53:22,680
anyway now
 

9003
03:53:22,680 --> 03:53:25,849

just do it no art art is the one thing

9004
03:53:25,849 --> 03:53:25,859
just do it no art art is the one thing
 

9005
03:53:25,859 --> 03:53:28,250
just do it no art art is the one thing
where one of the few things in life

9006
03:53:28,250 --> 03:53:28,260
where one of the few things in life
 

9007
03:53:28,260 --> 03:53:31,610
where one of the few things in life
where you really don't need a talent you

9008
03:53:31,610 --> 03:53:31,620
where you really don't need a talent you
 

9009
03:53:31,620 --> 03:53:34,610
where you really don't need a talent you
can create your talent a talent would

9010
03:53:34,610 --> 03:53:34,620
can create your talent a talent would
 

9011
03:53:34,620 --> 03:53:36,769
can create your talent a talent would
maybe help if you have a natural talent

9012
03:53:36,769 --> 03:53:36,779
maybe help if you have a natural talent
 

9013
03:53:36,779 --> 03:53:38,809
maybe help if you have a natural talent
for it but honestly it's really just a

9014
03:53:38,809 --> 03:53:38,819
for it but honestly it's really just a
 

9015
03:53:38,819 --> 03:53:41,269
for it but honestly it's really just a
bad practice so

9016
03:53:41,269 --> 03:53:41,279
bad practice so
 

9017
03:53:41,279 --> 03:53:44,990
bad practice so
practice and then you have the skill and

9018
03:53:44,990 --> 03:53:45,000
practice and then you have the skill and
 

9019
03:53:45,000 --> 03:53:46,969
practice and then you have the skill and
then you what you really need then maybe

9020
03:53:46,969 --> 03:53:46,979
then you what you really need then maybe
 

9021
03:53:46,979 --> 03:53:48,889
then you what you really need then maybe
is a little bit of luck to get a name

9022
03:53:48,889 --> 03:53:48,899
is a little bit of luck to get a name
 

9023
03:53:48,899 --> 03:53:51,170
is a little bit of luck to get a name
for yourself to get out there and then

9024
03:53:51,170 --> 03:53:51,180
for yourself to get out there and then
 

9025
03:53:51,180 --> 03:53:53,090
for yourself to get out there and then
to get the good jobs

9026
03:53:53,090 --> 03:53:53,100
to get the good jobs
 

9027
03:53:53,100 --> 03:53:55,190
to get the good jobs
that you want

9028
03:53:55,190 --> 03:53:55,200
that you want
 

9029
03:53:55,200 --> 03:53:56,690
that you want
um

9030
03:53:56,690 --> 03:53:56,700
um
 

9031
03:53:56,700 --> 03:53:58,610
um
so that's what I wanted to do and could

9032
03:53:58,610 --> 03:53:58,620
so that's what I wanted to do and could
 

9033
03:53:58,620 --> 03:54:00,349
so that's what I wanted to do and could
have done

9034
03:54:00,349 --> 03:54:00,359
have done
 

9035
03:54:00,359 --> 03:54:03,590
have done
but yeah

9036
03:54:03,590 --> 03:54:03,600

 

9037
03:54:03,600 --> 03:54:06,590

kind of like that with music yeah

9038
03:54:06,590 --> 03:54:06,600
kind of like that with music yeah
 

9039
03:54:06,600 --> 03:54:10,670
kind of like that with music yeah
I suppose so

9040
03:54:10,670 --> 03:54:10,680

 

9041
03:54:10,680 --> 03:54:12,590

more or less yeah

9042
03:54:12,590 --> 03:54:12,600
more or less yeah
 

9043
03:54:12,600 --> 03:54:15,530
more or less yeah
a lot more more luck necessary with

9044
03:54:15,530 --> 03:54:15,540
a lot more more luck necessary with
 

9045
03:54:15,540 --> 03:54:17,090
a lot more more luck necessary with
music than

9046
03:54:17,090 --> 03:54:17,100
music than
 

9047
03:54:17,100 --> 03:54:19,170
music than
with art I think

9048
03:54:19,170 --> 03:54:19,180
with art I think
 

9049
03:54:19,180 --> 03:54:20,389
with art I think
[Music]

03:54:23,640 --> 03:54:26,090
I think there's like a million musicians
and bands out there that make really

9054
03:54:26,090 --> 03:54:26,100
and bands out there that make really
 

9055
03:54:26,100 --> 03:54:28,130
and bands out there that make really
good music and will never make as much
