231
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,509
, one disappeared, I was surprised, that's

how it was.  Well, one by one,
 

233
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:44,790

when summer turns to winter, it gets a little cold so

234
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:44,800
when summer turns to winter, it gets a little cold so
 

235
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:50,269
when summer turns to winter, it gets a little cold so
quickly that I wonder where autumn is, but,

236
00:10:50,269 --> 00:10:50,279
quickly that I wonder where autumn is, but,
 

237
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:53,350
quickly that I wonder where autumn is, but,
well, there is still autumn, there is still autumn,

this cold since October or November.

242
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,750
this cold since October or November.
 

243
00:10:59,750 --> 00:10:59,760

 

244
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:05,710

No, it seems a little hotter. I'm

00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:10,470
No, it seems a little hotter. I'm
 

246

just exaggerating. Yes,

248
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:14,560
just exaggerating. Yes,

autumn is gone in Japan too. I wonder.  Autumn is
 

251
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,230
autumn is gone in Japan too. I wonder.  Autumn is
disappearing. I feel like autumn is getting shorter. That's

252
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:21,240
disappearing. I feel like autumn is getting shorter. That's
 

253
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,590
disappearing. I feel like autumn is getting shorter. That's
right, why does it get cold so quickly? I feel like I'm getting colder

254
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:28,590
right, why does it get cold so quickly? I feel like I'm getting colder

00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:28,600

 

256

00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:32,279
earlier. Ah, there's a chance that autumn will no longer exist in 30 years.

00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:34,200
That
 

260
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,870
That
might be confusing, or

261
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:37,880
might be confusing, or
 

262
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:42,949
might be confusing, or
maybe it's just that the winter is just getting more and more out of sync.

263
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:42,959
maybe it's just that the winter is just getting more and more out of sync.
 

264
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:48,030
maybe it's just that the winter is just getting more and more out of sync.

happy to see a bench there that I sat down. I
 

286
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,310
happy to see a bench there that I sat down. I
thought there was a bench, and I was so happy to see something like this in the airport. I

287
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:28,320
thought there was a bench, and I was so happy to see something like this in the airport. I

295
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:41,590

a bench that I

296
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:41,600
a bench that I
 

297
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,150
a bench that I
found in a place other than the airport,

298
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,160
found in a place other than the airport,
 

299
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,269
found in a place other than the airport,

301
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,590

like a crumbled pancake,
 

496
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,270
like a crumbled pancake,

500
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:34,870
thought it was super delicious and we were really moved. It was so
beautiful, so beautiful. It was hair. But, you know,

Rika was a bit
 

504
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:39,350
Rika was a bit
surprised.  I do

00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:39,360
surprised.  I do
 

506
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,310
surprised.  I do
n't know, maybe it's just Lyrica, but I don't know,

511
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,270
but I don't really eat sweets for lunch or breakfast,
so I guess

00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:51,280
so I guess
 

513
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,470
so I guess
that's what it's like in Austria. I'd be surprised,

that's what it's like in Austria. I'd be surprised,
 

515

really liked that painting.

956
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:11,040
really liked that painting.
 

957
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,990
really liked that painting.
So, that Esi-san is showing off his

958
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:15,000
So, that Esi-san is showing off his
 

959
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,149
So, that Esi-san is showing off his
collection in museums and all over Europe,

960
00:34:19,149 --> 00:34:19,159
collection in museums and all over Europe,
 

961
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:22,430
collection in museums and all over Europe,
and he's chasing something.

962
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:22,440
and he's chasing something.
 

963
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,470
and he's chasing something.
So, he

964
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:25,480
So, he
 

965
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,230
So, he
was a big fan of Rembrandt. That's right, it was

966
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:30,550
was a big fan of Rembrandt. That's right, it was
 

967
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:30,560

 

968
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,669

Rembrandt-san,

969
00:34:32,669 --> 00:34:32,679
Rembrandt-san,
 

970
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:35,710
Rembrandt-san,
right? That's right, it was Rembrandt's art.

971
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:35,720
right? That's right, it was Rembrandt's art.
 

972
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,310
right? That's right, it was Rembrandt's art.
That exhibition was an exhibition of Rembrandt and his disciples, but it was

973
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:38,320
That exhibition was an exhibition of Rembrandt and his disciples, but it was
 

974
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,790
That exhibition was an exhibition of Rembrandt and his disciples, but it was
by other artists.  There were paintings, too,

975
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:41,800
by other artists.  There were paintings, too,
 

976
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,149
by other artists.  There were paintings, too,
so it

977
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:45,159
so it
 

978
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:47,270
so it
felt like an exhibition of Rembrandt's work as a teacher.

979
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:47,280
felt like an exhibition of Rembrandt's work as a teacher.
 

980
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,829
felt like an exhibition of Rembrandt's work as a teacher.
Yes, as expected, the biology

981
00:34:50,829 --> 00:34:50,839
Yes, as expected, the biology
 

982
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:54,149
Yes, as expected, the biology
section was by Hogstraten, I think that's how it was translated into Japanese.

983
00:34:54,149 --> 00:34:54,159
section was by Hogstraten, I think that's how it was translated into Japanese.
 

984
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,270
section was by Hogstraten, I think that's how it was translated into Japanese.
Yes, yes, yes.  That's

Yes, yes, yes.  That's
 

986
00:34:58,829 --> 00:34:58,839

 

987
00:34:58,839 --> 00:35:01,910

right, it looks like Hoss and Laden,

988
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:01,920
right, it looks like Hoss and Laden,
 

989
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,589
right, it looks like Hoss and Laden,
but it

990
00:35:05,589 --> 00:35:05,599

00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:09,310
but it
looks like Latte. Yes, it looks a bit like Laraten. I

00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,670
looks like Latte. Yes, it looks a bit like Laraten. I
liked this Cost

994
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:12,680

995
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,910
liked this Cost
Laraten. Oh, that's right. Laden bought a lot of

996
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:16,920
Laraten. Oh, that's right. Laden bought a lot of
 

997
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,310

n't buy Sacher anymore. That's

1002
00:35:26,349 --> 00:35:26,359
n't buy Sacher anymore. That's
 

1003
00:35:26,359 --> 00:35:28,349
n't buy Sacher anymore. That's
good.

1004
00:35:28,349 --> 00:35:28,359
good.
 

1005
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:32,470
good.
By the way, I

1006
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:32,480
By the way, I
 

1007
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,030
By the way, I
went to the art museum and

1008
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:35,040
went to the art museum and
 

1009
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,069
went to the art museum and
saw the exhibition of Rembrandt and Hochstler, and I

1010
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:38,079
saw the exhibition of Rembrandt and Hochstler, and I
 

1011
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,230
saw the exhibition of Rembrandt and Hochstler, and I
said I was going to see Bruegel after that.  But

1012
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:40,240
said I was going to see Bruegel after that.  But
 

1013
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,750
said I was going to see Bruegel after that.  But
Laden bought a lot of books and it was heavy. I

1014
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:42,760
Laden bought a lot of books and it was heavy. I
 

1015
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,790
Laden bought a lot of books and it was heavy. I
bought a lot of books and it was heavy. I

1016
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:45,800
bought a lot of books and it was heavy. I
 

1017
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,910
bought a lot of books and it was heavy. I
thought that, but I saw the number of times. Be

1018
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:48,920
thought that, but I saw the number of times. Be
 

1019
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,829
thought that, but I saw the number of times. Be
careful about the timing of when you buy books. It's

1020
00:35:51,829 --> 00:35:51,839
careful about the timing of when you buy books. It's
 

1021
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:54,750
careful about the timing of when you buy books. It's
heavy, so be careful. Yeah,

1022
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:54,760
heavy, so be careful. Yeah,
 

1023
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:58,829
heavy, so be careful. Yeah,
yeah, yeah.  I thought it was good, I was thinking about muscle training,

1024
00:35:58,829 --> 00:36:01,069
yeah, yeah.  I thought it was good, I was thinking about muscle training,
 

1025
00:36:01,069 --> 00:36:01,079

 

1026
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:05,510

so I went to the museum, the museum, please go ahead, sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but

1027
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:08,750
so I went to the museum, the museum, please go ahead, sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but
 

1028
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:08,760

 

1029
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,589

there was something I was curious about at the museum, so if you

1030
00:36:10,589 --> 00:36:10,599
there was something I was curious about at the museum, so if you
 

1031
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:12,870
there was something I was curious about at the museum, so if you
know anything about it, I'd like you to tell me.  But, yeah, I haven't

1032
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:12,880
know anything about it, I'd like you to tell me.  But, yeah, I haven't
 

1033
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,910
know anything about it, I'd like you to tell me.  But, yeah, I haven't
been to many art museums in Japan,

1034
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:14,920
been to many art museums in Japan,
 

1035
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,589
been to many art museums in Japan,
so I've only ever been to small ones, so I

1036
00:36:16,589 --> 00:36:16,599
so I've only ever been to small ones, so I
 

1037
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:18,510
so I've only ever been to small ones, so I
don't know, but

1038
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:18,520
don't know, but
 

1039
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,470
don't know, but
big art museums overseas have a lot of

1040
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:21,480
big art museums overseas have a lot of
 

1041
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:25,030
big art museums overseas have a lot of
places to sit, right? Yes, they do. They're

1042
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:25,040
places to sit, right? Yes, they do. They're
 

1043
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,390
places to sit, right? Yes, they do. They're
big and beautiful.  It's like a king, or something. I

1044
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:32,270
big and beautiful.  It's like a king, or something. I
 

1045
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:32,280

 

1046
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,190

wonder if a king would sit there. The bright red things on the river are lined up like this.

1047
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:35,200
wonder if a king would sit there. The bright red things on the river are lined up like this.
 

1048
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,030
wonder if a king would sit there. The bright red things on the river are lined up like this.
There are things like that in Japan too.

1049
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:40,670
There are things like that in Japan too.
 

1050
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:40,680

 

1051
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:45,829

It's like sitting and looking at artworks, enjoying the time.  Well,

1052
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:45,839
It's like sitting and looking at artworks, enjoying the time.  Well,
 

1053
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:51,030
It's like sitting and looking at artworks, enjoying the time.  Well,
I guess it's true, but I actually

1054
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:51,040
I guess it's true, but I actually
 

1055
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,589
I guess it's true, but I actually
went to Austria and passed it.

1056
00:36:54,589 --> 00:36:54,599
went to Austria and passed it.
 

1057
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:58,790
went to Austria and passed it.
Japanese art museums are a bit small, aren't

1058
00:36:58,790 --> 00:36:58,800
Japanese art museums are a bit small, aren't
 

1059
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:04,109
Japanese art museums are a bit small, aren't
they? It's a simple matter of the size of the space,

1060
00:37:04,109 --> 00:37:04,119
they? It's a simple matter of the size of the space,
 

1061
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:08,270
they? It's a simple matter of the size of the space,
but if you want to sit down, you

1062
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:08,280
but if you want to sit down, you
 

1063
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:12,109
but if you want to sit down, you
need a lot of space,

1064
00:37:12,109 --> 00:37:12,119
need a lot of space,
 

1065
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:15,710
need a lot of space,
so it's too close.  I

1066
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:19,470
so it's too close.  I
 

1067
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:19,480

 

1068
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,109

thought maybe it was a little hard to put a chair there, but I see.

1069
00:37:22,109 --> 00:37:22,119
thought maybe it was a little hard to put a chair there, but I see.
 

1070
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:25,870
thought maybe it was a little hard to put a chair there, but I see.
But it's a relief. If you can sit there

1071
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:25,880
But it's a relief. If you can sit there
 

1072
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:29,230
But it's a relief. If you can sit there
for such a long time, it's good to

1073
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:29,240
for such a long time, it's good to
 

1074
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,230
for such a long time, it's good to
sit down and

1075
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:31,240
sit down and
 

1076
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:34,430
sit down and
relax.  Moreover, if it was a big painting, I would

1077
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:34,440
relax.  Moreover, if it was a big painting, I would
 

1078
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,670
relax.  Moreover, if it was a big painting, I would
sit a little further away.

1079
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:37,680
sit a little further away.
 

1080
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,630
sit a little further away.
If it was big, it would be helpful. I was very

1081
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:40,640
If it was big, it would be helpful. I was very
 

1082
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,390
If it was big, it would be helpful. I was very
happy that there were so many chairs. I was able to take

1083
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:43,400
happy that there were so many chairs. I was able to take
 

1084
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,630
happy that there were so many chairs. I was able to take
my time to look at it. It was a naturalist museum. It was not a naturalist, it was an

1085
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:46,640
my time to look at it. It was a naturalist museum. It was not a naturalist, it was an
 

1086
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,710
my time to look at it. It was a naturalist museum. It was not a naturalist, it was an
artist. It had a good artistic feel.  It

1087
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:50,720
artist. It had a good artistic feel.  It
 

1088
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:55,190
artist. It had a good artistic feel.  It
was really good. It was like a dream. I was so happy to

1089
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:58,790
was really good. It was like a dream. I was so happy to
 

1090
00:37:58,790 --> 00:37:58,800

 

1091
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,870

think that there were so many paintings in one place. I almost skipped. I was so happy

1092
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:08,470
think that there were so many paintings in one place. I almost skipped. I was so happy
 

1093
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:08,480

 

1094
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:14,990

...

1095
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:15,000
...
 

1096
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,309
...
When someone seems to have gone somewhere, it just

1097
00:38:17,309 --> 00:38:17,319
When someone seems to have gone somewhere, it just
 

1098
00:38:17,319 --> 00:38:31,870
When someone seems to have gone somewhere, it just
happens, but I think, "

1099
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:31,880

 

1100
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,990

Yeah, there's this and that, too." Once I

1101
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:34,000
Yeah, there's this and that, too." Once I
 

1102
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,030
Yeah, there's this and that, too." Once I
started thinking about it, it got pretty fast.

1103
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:39,309

but it's even more intense than it was then. I've
 

3754

but it's even more intense than it was then. I've
had such a quality experience.  It

Ririka-chan, what do you think?  Ririka

3777
02:04:45,830 --> 02:04:50,310
Ririka-chan, what do you think?  Ririka
 

3778
02:04:50,310 --> 02:04:50,320

 

3779
02:04:50,320 --> 02:04:52,990

has been abroad a few times with her family and friends, but

3780
02:04:52,990 --> 02:04:53,000
has been abroad a few times with her family and friends, but
 

3781
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:57,069
has been abroad a few times with her family and friends, but
this time she went to visit Kia-senpai's place,

3782
02:04:57,069 --> 02:04:57,079
this time she went to visit Kia-senpai's place,
 

3783
02:04:57,079 --> 02:04:59,149
this time she went to visit Kia-senpai's place,
and it was like she had never been to a

3784
02:04:59,149 --> 02:04:59,159
and it was like she had never been to a
 

3785
02:04:59,159 --> 02:05:02,669
and it was like she had never been to a
foreign country before.  This was my

3786
02:05:02,669 --> 02:05:02,679
foreign country before.  This was my
 

3787
02:05:02,679 --> 02:05:05,790
foreign country before.  This was my
first experience of being

3788
02:05:05,790 --> 02:05:05,800
first experience of being
 

3789
02:05:05,800 --> 02:05:09,350
first experience of being
guided by someone like that.  I

3790
02:05:09,350 --> 02:05:12,510
guided by someone like that.  I
 

3791
02:05:12,510 --> 02:05:12,520

 

3792
02:05:12,520 --> 02:05:15,790

really took every mode of transportation, like the

3793
02:05:15,790 --> 02:05:15,800
really took every mode of transportation, like the
 

3794
02:05:15,800 --> 02:05:19,430
really took every mode of transportation, like the
bus, yeah, I took every one,

3795
02:05:19,430 --> 02:05:19,440
bus, yeah, I took every one,
 

3796
02:05:19,440 --> 02:05:22,910
bus, yeah, I took every one,
yeah, I took every one. That's right, I guess you can't just

3797
02:05:22,910 --> 02:05:22,920
yeah, I took every one. That's right, I guess you can't just
 

3798
02:05:22,920 --> 02:05:26,109
yeah, I took every one. That's right, I guess you can't just
look it up in books or on the internet, but there are

3799
02:05:26,109 --> 02:05:26,119
look it up in books or on the internet, but there are
 

3800
02:05:26,119 --> 02:05:29,510
look it up in books or on the internet, but there are
parts that you can't get to know, really,

3801
02:05:29,510 --> 02:05:29,520
parts that you can't get to know, really,
 

3802
02:05:29,520 --> 02:05:32,709
parts that you can't get to know, really,
these past three days.  Even in such a short time, they

3803
02:05:32,709 --> 02:05:32,719
these past three days.  Even in such a short time, they
 

3804
02:05:32,719 --> 02:05:36,229
these past three days.  Even in such a short time, they
managed to condense everything

3805
02:05:36,229 --> 02:05:36,239
managed to condense everything
 

3806
02:05:36,239 --> 02:05:38,430
managed to condense everything
so that everyone could enjoy themselves to the fullest,

3807
02:05:38,430 --> 02:05:41,830
so that everyone could enjoy themselves to the fullest,
 

3808
02:05:41,830 --> 02:05:41,840

 

3809
02:05:41,840 --> 02:05:45,430

and I really felt that Laden-chan was really

3810
02:05:45,430 --> 02:05:45,440
and I really felt that Laden-chan was really
 

3811
02:05:45,440 --> 02:05:48,910
and I really felt that Laden-chan was really
amazing in all sorts of ways.  I was really

3812
02:05:48,910 --> 02:05:48,920
amazing in all sorts of ways.  I was really
 

3813
02:05:48,920 --> 02:05:52,790
amazing in all sorts of ways.  I was really
touched and it was fun, but Ririka-chan also loved chandeliers. She

3814
02:05:52,790 --> 02:05:55,669
touched and it was fun, but Ririka-chan also loved chandeliers. She
 

3815
02:05:55,669 --> 02:05:55,679

 

3816
02:05:55,679 --> 02:05:58,750

became a chandelier girl, and Ririka-chan

3817
02:05:58,750 --> 02:06:01,990
became a chandelier girl, and Ririka-chan
 

3818
02:06:01,990 --> 02:06:02,000

 

3819
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,510

is a chandelier girl. She's a chandelier girl, so it

3820
02:06:04,510 --> 02:06:04,520
is a chandelier girl. She's a chandelier girl, so it
 

3821
02:06:04,520 --> 02:06:07,709
is a chandelier girl. She's a chandelier girl, so it
was really fun to walk together and we were all

3822
02:06:07,709 --> 02:06:07,719
was really fun to walk together and we were all
 

3823
02:06:07,719 --> 02:06:11,310
was really fun to walk together and we were all
really friends.  I was

3824
02:06:11,310 --> 02:06:14,149
really friends.  I was
 

3825
02:06:14,149 --> 02:06:14,159

 

3826
02:06:14,159 --> 02:06:17,470

so happy to be able to go to so many different places,

3827
02:06:17,470 --> 02:06:17,480
so happy to be able to go to so many different places,
 

3828
02:06:17,480 --> 02:06:21,669
so happy to be able to go to so many different places,
so I'm really

3829
02:06:21,669 --> 02:06:21,679
so I'm really
 

3830
02:06:21,679 --> 02:06:23,910
so I'm really
grateful. I was born in Austria and have

3831
02:06:23,910 --> 02:06:23,920
grateful. I was born in Austria and have
 

3832
02:06:23,920 --> 02:06:28,270
grateful. I was born in Austria and have
always lived there, so surprisingly,

3833
02:06:28,270 --> 02:06:28,280
always lived there, so surprisingly,
 

3834
02:06:28,280 --> 02:06:31,950
always lived there, so surprisingly,
this time I went to a few places for the first time, like the Martial Arts Museum, and the

3835
02:06:31,950 --> 02:06:31,960
this time I went to a few places for the first time, like the Martial Arts Museum, and the
 

3836
02:06:31,960 --> 02:06:36,669
this time I went to a few places for the first time, like the Martial Arts Museum, and the
opera.  I had fun too, but  What

3837
02:06:36,669 --> 02:06:36,679
opera.  I had fun too, but  What
 

3838
02:06:36,679 --> 02:06:41,069
opera.  I had fun too, but  What
made me happiest was that after those two

3839
02:06:41,069 --> 02:06:41,079
made me happiest was that after those two
 

3840
02:06:41,079 --> 02:06:45,990
made me happiest was that after those two
said they were going, they actually came this year, which

3841
02:06:45,990 --> 02:06:46,000
said they were going, they actually came this year, which
 

3842
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,149
said they were going, they actually came this year, which
was a miracle. I

3843
02:06:48,149 --> 02:06:48,159
was a miracle. I
 

3844
02:06:48,159 --> 02:06:54,549
was a miracle. I
got along well with them and it was the

3845
02:06:54,549 --> 02:06:54,559
got along well with them and it was the
 

3846
02:06:54,559 --> 02:06:58,870
got along well with them and it was the
first time I'd had a friend in a long time, and they were really great

3847
02:06:58,870 --> 02:06:58,880
first time I'd had a friend in a long time, and they were really great
 

3848
02:06:58,880 --> 02:07:02,830
first time I'd had a friend in a long time, and they were really great
friends.  I'm happy that we were able to do it, and I hope that from now on, the

3849
02:07:02,830 --> 02:07:02,840
friends.  I'm happy that we were able to do it, and I hope that from now on, the
 

3850
02:07:02,840 --> 02:07:06,669
friends.  I'm happy that we were able to do it, and I hope that from now on, the
three of us

3851
02:07:06,669 --> 02:07:06,679
three of us
 

3852
02:07:06,679 --> 02:07:10,149
three of us
can do lots of fun things together in Hololive, and I hope that we

3853
02:07:10,149 --> 02:07:10,159
can do lots of fun things together in Hololive, and I hope that we
 

3854
02:07:10,159 --> 02:07:12,510
can do lots of fun things together in Hololive, and I hope that we
can do good deeds together in another place,

3855
02:07:12,510 --> 02:07:12,520
can do good deeds together in another place,
 

3856
02:07:12,520 --> 02:07:17,709
can do good deeds together in another place,
and I wonder what that story is all about.

3857
02:07:17,709 --> 02:07:17,719
and I wonder what that story is all about.
 

3858
02:07:17,719 --> 02:07:19,430

really happy about that. I'm a senior, so I

get along with everyone in Hololive, but there's something

get along with everyone in Hololive, but there's something
 

3869
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:47,229
get along with everyone in Hololive, but there's something
deeper.  I'm so happy that I was able to make it. I
