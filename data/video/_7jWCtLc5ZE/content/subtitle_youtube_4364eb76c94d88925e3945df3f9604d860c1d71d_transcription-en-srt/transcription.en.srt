little bit back on because they have uh
DVR was it DVR on so you can look back a

3138
01:27:57,910 --> 01:27:57,920
DVR was it DVR on so you can look back a
 

3139
01:27:57,920 --> 01:27:59,830
DVR was it DVR on so you can look back a
little bit and it looked like maybe the

3140
01:27:59,830 --> 01:27:59,840
little bit and it looked like maybe the
 

3141
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:01,750
little bit and it looked like maybe the
part where I joined in was the

3142
01:28:01,750 --> 01:28:01,760
part where I joined in was the
 

3143
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:03,870
part where I joined in was the
first

3144
01:28:03,870 --> 01:28:03,880
first
 

3145
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:07,070
first
eclipse on the American

3146
01:28:07,070 --> 01:28:07,080
eclipse on the American
 

3147
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:09,510
eclipse on the American
land and then there were many following

3148
01:28:09,510 --> 01:28:09,520
land and then there were many following
 

3149
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:11,350
land and then there were many following
right but I somehow thought there was no

3150
01:28:11,350 --> 01:28:11,360
right but I somehow thought there was no
 

3151
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:13,750
right but I somehow thought there was no
more like this is the only one one and

3152
01:28:13,750 --> 01:28:13,760
more like this is the only one one and
 

3153
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:16,990
more like this is the only one one and
in all of America you see this one but

3154
01:28:16,990 --> 01:28:17,000
in all of America you see this one but
 

3155
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,109
in all of America you see this one but
no so I guess uh it travels Across

3156
01:28:19,109 --> 01:28:19,119
no so I guess uh it travels Across
 

3157
01:28:19,119 --> 01:28:21,550
no so I guess uh it travels Across
America cuz America is pretty big and it

3158
01:28:21,550 --> 01:28:21,560
America cuz America is pretty big and it
 

3159
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:23,790
America cuz America is pretty big and it
had this path Across America right so

3160
01:28:23,790 --> 01:28:23,800
had this path Across America right so
 

3161
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:26,629
had this path Across America right so
many people could see it that's really

3162
01:28:26,629 --> 01:28:26,639
many people could see it that's really
 

3163
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:28,990

like it's difficult and so they were

5488
02:33:23,150 --> 02:33:23,160

5489
02:33:23,160 --> 02:33:25,870
like it's difficult and so they were
like okay like we want a fre lane road

5490

but it's getting too high here and it's

5492
02:33:28,230 --> 02:33:28,240
but it's getting too high here and it's
 

5493
02:33:28,240 --> 02:33:30,230
but it's getting too high here and it's
too expensive to flatten the the road

5494
02:33:30,230 --> 02:33:30,240
too expensive to flatten the the road

6655
03:01:49,600 --> 03:01:52,110

on Saturday Sunday while so many others

6656
03:01:52,110 --> 03:01:52,120
on Saturday Sunday while so many others
 

6657
03:01:52,120 --> 03:01:54,469

and thus you can also kind of a little

6662
03:01:58,590 --> 03:01:58,600
and thus you can also kind of a little
 

6663
03:01:58,600 --> 03:02:01,070
and thus you can also kind of a little
bit at least spread out the attendance

6664
03:02:01,070 --> 03:02:01,080
bit at least spread out the attendance
 

6665
03:02:01,080 --> 03:02:03,349
bit at least spread out the attendance
Saturday will always be the most crowded

03:02:04,870 --> 03:02:04,880
but I feel like by extending it to three
 

6669
03:02:04,880 --> 03:02:06,870
but I feel like by extending it to three
days you will at least to some extent be

6670
03:02:06,870 --> 03:02:06,880
days you will at least to some extent be
 

6671
03:02:06,880 --> 03:02:09,870

able to to uh like spread out the

attendance maybe and I just thought it
deserved it as such a great

6676
03:02:14,990 --> 03:02:15,000
deserved it as such a great
 

6677
03:02:15,000 --> 03:02:17,150
deserved it as such a great
convention and they wouldn't do it for

one of the stronger ones and then there
was one more stronger one but who knows

9174
04:08:17,670 --> 04:08:17,680

so I was
like but if you press it even longer it

10864
04:51:51,708 --> 04:51:51,718
like but if you press it even longer it
 

10865
04:51:51,718 --> 04:51:55,190
like but if you press it even longer it
makes this like Melody note on N so it

10866
04:51:55,190 --> 04:51:55,200
makes this like Melody note on N so it
 

10867
04:51:55,200 --> 04:51:59,510
makes this like Melody note on N so it
becomes like a distanced attack honestly

10868
04:51:59,510 --> 04:51:59,520
becomes like a distanced attack honestly
 

10869
04:51:59,520 --> 04:52:01,548
becomes like a distanced attack honestly
after seeing that I don't think I would

10870
04:52:01,548 --> 04:52:01,558
after seeing that I don't think I would
 

10871
04:52:01,558 --> 04:52:04,830
after seeing that I don't think I would
have used it much or needed to use it

10872
04:52:04,830 --> 04:52:04,840
have used it much or needed to use it
 

10873
04:52:04,840 --> 04:52:09,310
have used it much or needed to use it
didn't seem that good so you it takes

10874
04:52:09,310 --> 04:52:09,320
didn't seem that good so you it takes
 

10875
04:52:09,320 --> 04:52:13,150
didn't seem that good so you it takes
quite a while to charge you

10876
04:52:13,150 --> 04:52:13,160

 

10877
04:52:13,160 --> 04:52:16,948

yeah I don't really care for that so no

10878
04:52:16,948 --> 04:52:16,958
yeah I don't really care for that so no
 

10879
04:52:16,958 --> 04:52:19,548
yeah I don't really care for that so no
need for Power

10880
04:52:19,548 --> 04:52:19,558
need for Power
 

10881
04:52:19,558 --> 04:52:21,708
need for Power
Attack

10882
04:52:21,708 --> 04:52:21,718
Attack
 

10883
04:52:21,718 --> 04:52:23,910
Attack
yeah most of the time you don't really

10884
04:52:23,910 --> 04:52:23,920
yeah most of the time you don't really
 

10885
04:52:23,920 --> 04:52:26,470
yeah most of the time you don't really
have time to charge so many things so

10886
04:52:26,470 --> 04:52:26,480
have time to charge so many things so
 

10887
04:52:26,480 --> 04:52:30,190
have time to charge so many things so
often because you're constantly getting

10888
04:52:30,190 --> 04:52:30,200
often because you're constantly getting
 

10889
04:52:30,200 --> 04:52:31,830
often because you're constantly getting
attacked

10890
04:52:31,830 --> 04:52:31,840
attacked
 

10891
04:52:31,840 --> 04:52:34,470
attacked
yeah partex are a trap in my opinion you

10892
04:52:34,470 --> 04:52:34,480
yeah partex are a trap in my opinion you
 

10893
04:52:34,480 --> 04:52:37,110
yeah partex are a trap in my opinion you
until you get the right maybe yeah if if

10894
04:52:37,110 --> 04:52:37,120
until you get the right maybe yeah if if
 

10895
04:52:37,120 --> 04:52:38,830
until you get the right maybe yeah if if
there's an item that can make you charge

10896
04:52:38,830 --> 04:52:38,840
there's an item that can make you charge
 

10897
04:52:38,840 --> 04:52:42,590
there's an item that can make you charge
power attacks faster then okay otherwise

10898
04:52:42,590 --> 04:52:42,600
power attacks faster then okay otherwise
 

10899
04:52:42,600 --> 04:52:44,030
power attacks faster then okay otherwise
I don't

10900
04:52:44,030 --> 04:52:44,040
I don't
 

10901
04:52:44,040 --> 04:52:46,628
I don't
know they now made it so you resist some

10902
04:52:46,628 --> 04:52:46,638
know they now made it so you resist some
 

10903
04:52:46,638 --> 04:52:50,190
know they now made it so you resist some
attack while charging oh really W okay

10904
04:52:50,190 --> 04:52:50,200
attack while charging oh really W okay
 

10905
04:52:50,200 --> 04:52:53,430
attack while charging oh really W okay
that's a a good update I

10906
04:52:53,430 --> 04:52:53,440
that's a a good update I
 

10907
04:52:53,440 --> 04:52:55,590
that's a a good update I
guess but they shouldn't make things too

10908
04:52:55,590 --> 04:52:55,600
guess but they shouldn't make things too
 

10909
04:52:55,600 --> 04:52:58,948
guess but they shouldn't make things too
easy honestly I really felt like there

10910
04:52:58,948 --> 04:52:58,958
easy honestly I really felt like there
 

10911
04:52:58,958 --> 04:53:02,948
easy honestly I really felt like there
being no way of saving until the end was

10912
04:53:02,948 --> 04:53:02,958
being no way of saving until the end was
 

10913
04:53:02,958 --> 04:53:06,510
being no way of saving until the end was
fine for me like I thought that's just

10914
04:53:06,510 --> 04:53:06,520
fine for me like I thought that's just
 

10915
04:53:06,520 --> 04:53:10,190
fine for me like I thought that's just
like just like uh Holo cure now they

10916
04:53:10,190 --> 04:53:10,200
like just like uh Holo cure now they
 

10917
04:53:10,200 --> 04:53:12,110
like just like uh Holo cure now they
added it and I guess I'm going to use it

10918
04:53:12,110 --> 04:53:12,120
added it and I guess I'm going to use it
 

10919
04:53:12,120 --> 04:53:17,310
added it and I guess I'm going to use it
but it really makes everything a lot

10920
04:53:17,310 --> 04:53:17,320

 

10921
04:53:17,320 --> 04:53:20,390

easier yeah but I guess a lot of people

10922
04:53:20,390 --> 04:53:20,400
easier yeah but I guess a lot of people
 

10923
04:53:20,400 --> 04:53:23,788
easier yeah but I guess a lot of people
just really wanted the safe

10924
04:53:23,788 --> 04:53:23,798

 

10925
04:53:23,798 --> 04:53:27,030

feature and the the shock with from Miki

10926
04:53:27,030 --> 04:53:27,040
feature and the the shock with from Miki
 

10927
04:53:27,040 --> 04:53:30,910
feature and the the shock with from Miki
put a lot of pressure on them

10928
04:53:30,910 --> 04:53:30,920

 

10929
04:53:30,920 --> 04:53:34,350

maybe but I thought it made sense to not

10930
04:53:34,350 --> 04:53:34,360
maybe but I thought it made sense to not
 

10931
04:53:34,360 --> 04:53:36,430
maybe but I thought it made sense to not
have a safe

10932
04:53:36,430 --> 04:53:36,440
have a safe
 

10933
04:53:36,440 --> 04:53:40,190
have a safe
feature yeah it's like a rogue like mhm

10934
04:53:40,190 --> 04:53:40,200
feature yeah it's like a rogue like mhm
 

10935
04:53:40,200 --> 04:53:42,270
feature yeah it's like a rogue like mhm
and in the end even if you fail you

10936
04:53:42,270 --> 04:53:42,280
and in the end even if you fail you
 

10937
04:53:42,280 --> 04:53:44,750
and in the end even if you fail you
still get it still gets easier for you

10938
04:53:44,750 --> 04:53:44,760
still get it still gets easier for you
 

10939
04:53:44,760 --> 04:53:47,590
still get it still gets easier for you
because you still G gain the experience

10940
04:53:47,590 --> 04:53:47,600
because you still G gain the experience
 

10941
04:53:47,600 --> 04:53:50,310
because you still G gain the experience
from it so it will get

10942
04:53:50,310 --> 04:53:50,320
from it so it will get
 

10943
04:53:50,320 --> 04:53:53,270
from it so it will get
easier I feel like now that you can save

10944
04:53:53,270 --> 04:53:53,280
easier I feel like now that you can save
 

10945
