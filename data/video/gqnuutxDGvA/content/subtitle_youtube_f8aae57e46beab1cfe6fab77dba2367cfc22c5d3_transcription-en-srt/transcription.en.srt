too like if you don't take a direct
flight

2736

2739
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,669
yeah I remember though I think actually
the price

2740
01:21:55,669 --> 01:21:55,679
the price
 

2741
01:21:55,679 --> 01:21:59,750

2743
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:01,790
of the flights went down over the years
to be honest because I remember it being

2744
01:22:01,790 --> 01:22:01,800
to be honest because I remember it being
 

2745
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:04,129
to be honest because I remember it being
way more expensive when I first flew to

2746
01:22:04,129 --> 01:22:04,139
way more expensive when I first flew to
 

2747
01:22:04,139 --> 01:22:06,830
way more expensive when I first flew to
Japan but maybe that was because I flew

2748
01:22:06,830 --> 01:22:06,840
Japan but maybe that was because I flew
 

2749
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:07,729
Japan but maybe that was because I flew
of

2750
01:22:07,729 --> 01:22:07,739
of
 

2751
01:22:07,739 --> 01:22:10,790
of
ah no you know what I think back then

2752
01:22:10,790 --> 01:22:10,800
ah no you know what I think back then
 

2753

01:22:13,070 --> 01:22:13,080
that's like so many years ago
 

2755
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:15,350
that's like so many years ago
um the thing was that there weren't so

2756
01:22:15,350 --> 01:22:15,360
um the thing was that there weren't so
 

2757
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:18,709
um the thing was that there weren't so
many choices as there were now so I flew

2758
01:22:18,709 --> 01:22:18,719
many choices as there were now so I flew
 

2759
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:20,330
many choices as there were now so I flew
with Lufthansa

2760
01:22:20,330 --> 01:22:20,340
with Lufthansa
 

2761
01:22:20,340 --> 01:22:23,149
with Lufthansa
and it was pretty expensive

2762
01:22:23,149 --> 01:22:23,159
and it was pretty expensive
 

2763
01:22:23,159 --> 01:22:24,649
and it was pretty expensive
but I think

2764
01:22:24,649 --> 01:22:24,659
but I think
 

2765
01:22:24,659 --> 01:22:26,629
but I think
um now there's so many more choices like

2766
01:22:26,629 --> 01:22:26,639
um now there's so many more choices like
 

2767
01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:27,890

01:22:30,620 --> 01:22:35,030

and oh wait did I miss that oh is that

2772
01:22:35,030 --> 01:22:35,040
and oh wait did I miss that oh is that
 

2773
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:36,649
and oh wait did I miss that oh is that
where I would have landed if I would

2774
01:22:36,649 --> 01:22:36,659
where I would have landed if I would
 

2775
01:22:36,659 --> 01:22:38,689
where I would have landed if I would
have gone uh up instead of down first

2776
01:22:38,689 --> 01:22:38,699
have gone uh up instead of down first
 

2777
01:22:38,699 --> 01:22:43,430
have gone uh up instead of down first
[\h__\h] oh well whatever I was saying um

2778
01:22:43,430 --> 01:22:43,440
[\h__\h] oh well whatever I was saying um
 

2779
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:45,410
[\h__\h] oh well whatever I was saying um
yeah there are more

2780
01:22:45,410 --> 01:22:45,420
yeah there are more
 

2781
01:22:45,420 --> 01:22:48,229
yeah there are more
more choices now you can instead of a

2782
01:22:48,229 --> 01:22:48,239
more choices now you can instead of a
 

2783
01:22:48,239 --> 01:22:50,629
more choices now you can instead of a
direct flight you can go through so many

2784
01:22:50,629 --> 01:22:50,639
direct flight you can go through so many
 

2785
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:52,689
direct flight you can go through so many
different airlines

2786
01:22:52,689 --> 01:22:52,699
different airlines
 

2787
01:22:52,699 --> 01:23:05,629
different airlines
and all go to Japan one way or another

2788
01:23:05,629 --> 01:23:05,639

 

2789
01:23:05,639 --> 01:23:07,910

so I think in that sense

2790
01:23:07,910 --> 01:23:07,920
so I think in that sense
 

2791
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:09,770
so I think in that sense
you at least have more choices so it's

2792
01:23:09,770 --> 01:23:09,780
you at least have more choices so it's
 

2793
01:23:09,780 --> 01:23:14,330
you at least have more choices so it's
kind of cheaper

2794
01:23:14,330 --> 01:23:14,340

 

2795
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:16,070

what to do so then the dude who was

5072
02:25:52,370 --> 02:25:52,380
what to do so then the dude who was
 

5073
02:25:52,380 --> 02:25:54,590
what to do so then the dude who was
interviewing me kind of gave up on me

5074
02:25:54,590 --> 02:25:54,600
interviewing me kind of gave up on me
 

5075

um so the solution to this would have

5078
02:25:59,690 --> 02:25:59,700
um so the solution to this would have
 

5079
02:25:59,700 --> 02:26:05,210
um so the solution to this would have
been uh to find someone to switch seats

5080
02:26:05,210 --> 02:26:05,220
been uh to find someone to switch seats
 

5081

5083
02:26:06,660 --> 02:26:12,830
with
I guess I think I think that was

5084
02:26:12,830 --> 02:26:12,840

 

5085
02:26:12,840 --> 02:26:13,550

um

5086
02:26:13,550 --> 02:26:13,560

what he wanted me to do

5088
02:26:16,910 --> 02:26:16,920
what he wanted me to do
 

5089
02:26:16,920 --> 02:26:18,670
what he wanted me to do
I think

5090
02:26:18,670 --> 02:26:18,680
I think
 

5091
02:26:18,680 --> 02:26:21,230
I think
and then there was a second situation

5092
02:26:21,230 --> 02:26:21,240
and then there was a second situation
 

5093
02:26:21,240 --> 02:26:23,150
and then there was a second situation
and I don't I don't quite remember that

5094
02:26:23,150 --> 02:26:23,160
and I don't I don't quite remember that
 

5095
02:26:23,160 --> 02:26:25,309
and I don't I don't quite remember that
one but I also kind of failed that one

one but I also kind of failed that one
 

5097
02:26:25,319 --> 02:26:27,410
one but I also kind of failed that one
but I think

5098
02:26:27,410 --> 02:26:27,420
but I think
 

5099
02:26:27,420 --> 02:26:29,750
but I think
think

5100
02:26:29,750 --> 02:26:29,760
think
 

5101
02:26:29,760 --> 02:26:32,750
think
he that wasn't it wasn't like

02:26:34,790 --> 02:26:34,800
um that was like my
 

5105
02:26:34,800 --> 02:26:37,250

I was told that they were going to do a
blood test

and I was worried
 

5955
02:47:02,819 --> 02:47:03,650
and I was worried
um

5956
02:47:03,650 --> 02:47:03,660
um
 

5957
02:47:03,660 --> 02:47:06,170
um
you know because I told you guys that I

5958
02:47:06,170 --> 02:47:06,180
you know because I told you guys that I
 

5959
02:47:06,180 --> 02:47:08,690
you know because I told you guys that I
have fibromyalgia or at least you would

5960
02:47:08,690 --> 02:47:08,700
have fibromyalgia or at least you would
 

5961
02:47:08,700 --> 02:47:10,370
have fibromyalgia or at least you would
think that I have it who knows maybe I

5962
02:47:10,370 --> 02:47:10,380
think that I have it who knows maybe I
 

5963
02:47:10,380 --> 02:47:11,690
think that I have it who knows maybe I
have something else we don't know for

5964
02:47:11,690 --> 02:47:11,700
have something else we don't know for
 

5965
02:47:11,700 --> 02:47:13,550
have something else we don't know for
sure but

5966
02:47:13,550 --> 02:47:13,560
sure but
 

5967
02:47:13,560 --> 02:47:14,870
sure but
um one of

5968
02:47:14,870 --> 02:47:14,880
um one of
 

5969
02:47:14,880 --> 02:47:17,030
um one of
uh back then I was trying to figure out

5970
02:47:17,030 --> 02:47:17,040
uh back then I was trying to figure out
 

5971
02:47:17,040 --> 02:47:20,469
uh back then I was trying to figure out
how to fix it how to deal with it and

5972
02:47:20,469 --> 02:47:20,479
how to fix it how to deal with it and
 

5973
02:47:20,479 --> 02:47:24,530
how to fix it how to deal with it and
one of the things that we tried is a

5974
02:47:24,530 --> 02:47:24,540
one of the things that we tried is a
 

5975
02:47:24,540 --> 02:47:28,010
one of the things that we tried is a
doctor prescribed me

5976
02:47:28,010 --> 02:47:28,020

 

5977
02:47:28,020 --> 02:47:32,389

um an antidepressant for fibromyalgia

5978
02:47:32,389 --> 02:47:32,399
um an antidepressant for fibromyalgia
 

5979
02:47:32,399 --> 02:47:33,889
um an antidepressant for fibromyalgia
because

5980
02:47:33,889 --> 02:47:33,899
because
 

5981
02:47:33,899 --> 02:47:36,250
because
uh apparently that's

5982
02:47:36,250 --> 02:47:36,260
uh apparently that's
 

5983
02:47:36,260 --> 02:47:39,769
uh apparently that's
maybe helps some people and I was

5984
02:47:39,769 --> 02:47:39,779
maybe helps some people and I was
 

5985
02:47:39,779 --> 02:47:43,610
maybe helps some people and I was
thinking if they see that

5986
02:47:43,610 --> 02:47:43,620
thinking if they see that
 

5987
02:47:43,620 --> 02:47:46,969
thinking if they see that
I've been taking that in my blood

5988
02:47:46,969 --> 02:47:46,979
I've been taking that in my blood
 

5989
02:47:46,979 --> 02:47:50,150
I've been taking that in my blood
then they might question me why I'm

5990
02:47:50,150 --> 02:47:50,160
then they might question me why I'm
 

5991
02:47:50,160 --> 02:47:51,290
then they might question me why I'm
taking it

5992
02:47:51,290 --> 02:47:51,300
taking it
 

5993
02:47:51,300 --> 02:47:53,469
taking it
uh

5994
02:47:53,469 --> 02:47:53,479
uh
 

5995
02:47:53,479 --> 02:47:57,889
uh
and either way if I would if I were like

5996
02:47:57,889 --> 02:47:57,899
and either way if I would if I were like
 

5997
02:47:57,899 --> 02:48:00,650
and either way if I would if I were like
if they think I'm I take it because of

5998
02:48:00,650 --> 02:48:00,660
if they think I'm I take it because of
 

5999
02:48:00,660 --> 02:48:02,389
if they think I'm I take it because of
depression then they probably don't want

6000
02:48:02,389 --> 02:48:02,399
depression then they probably don't want
 

6001
02:48:02,399 --> 02:48:05,030
depression then they probably don't want
me but if they if I say it's because of

6002
02:48:05,030 --> 02:48:05,040
me but if they if I say it's because of
 

6003
02:48:05,040 --> 02:48:06,590
me but if they if I say it's because of
the fibromyalgia then that would

6004
02:48:06,590 --> 02:48:06,600
the fibromyalgia then that would
 

6005
02:48:06,600 --> 02:48:09,590
the fibromyalgia then that would
probably also be a reason to

6006
02:48:09,590 --> 02:48:09,600
probably also be a reason to
 

6007
02:48:09,600 --> 02:48:12,650
probably also be a reason to
um turned me down because like I know I

6008
02:48:12,650 --> 02:48:12,660
um turned me down because like I know I
 

6009
02:48:12,660 --> 02:48:14,269
um turned me down because like I know I
know that I can handle it I've lived

6010
02:48:14,269 --> 02:48:14,279
know that I can handle it I've lived
 

6011
02:48:14,279 --> 02:48:17,150
know that I can handle it I've lived
with it for my whole life and I can

6012
02:48:17,150 --> 02:48:17,160
with it for my whole life and I can
 

6013
02:48:17,160 --> 02:48:21,950
with it for my whole life and I can
totally live normally with it but uh I

6014
02:48:21,950 --> 02:48:21,960
totally live normally with it but uh I
 

6015
02:48:21,960 --> 02:48:23,990
totally live normally with it but uh I
figured that if they would know

6016
02:48:23,990 --> 02:48:24,000
figured that if they would know
 

6017
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:27,650
figured that if they would know
that they wouldn't want me and turns out

6018
02:48:27,650 --> 02:48:27,660
that they wouldn't want me and turns out
 

6019
02:48:27,660 --> 02:48:30,230
that they wouldn't want me and turns out
I was right but I didn't want them to

6020
02:48:30,230 --> 02:48:30,240
I was right but I didn't want them to
 

6021
02:48:30,240 --> 02:48:32,450
I was right but I didn't want them to
find out through my blood

6022
02:48:32,450 --> 02:48:32,460
find out through my blood
 

6023
02:48:32,460 --> 02:48:35,630
find out through my blood
uh actually turns out they couldn't have

6024
02:48:35,630 --> 02:48:35,640
uh actually turns out they couldn't have
 

6025
02:48:35,640 --> 02:48:37,370
uh actually turns out they couldn't have
found out for my blood because it

6026
02:48:37,370 --> 02:48:37,380
found out for my blood because it
 

6027
02:48:37,380 --> 02:48:39,170
found out for my blood because it
doesn't show up at least I'm with a

6028
02:48:39,170 --> 02:48:39,180
doesn't show up at least I'm with a
 

6029
02:48:39,180 --> 02:48:41,809
doesn't show up at least I'm with a
simple basic blood test like that but

6030
02:48:41,809 --> 02:48:41,819
simple basic blood test like that but
 

6031
02:48:41,819 --> 02:48:43,490
simple basic blood test like that but
but I didn't want to risk it I didn't

6032
02:48:43,490 --> 02:48:43,500
but I didn't want to risk it I didn't
 

6033
02:48:43,500 --> 02:48:45,290
but I didn't want to risk it I didn't
want to you know explain myself

6034
02:48:45,290 --> 02:48:45,300
want to you know explain myself
 

6035
02:48:45,300 --> 02:48:48,410
want to you know explain myself
afterwards so I did tell the doctor that

6036
02:48:48,410 --> 02:48:48,420
afterwards so I did tell the doctor that
 

6037
02:48:48,420 --> 02:48:52,070
afterwards so I did tell the doctor that
I supposedly have fibromyalgia and that

6038
02:48:52,070 --> 02:48:52,080
I supposedly have fibromyalgia and that
 

6039
02:48:52,080 --> 02:48:54,110
I supposedly have fibromyalgia and that
was the reason why they didn't they

6040
02:48:54,110 --> 02:48:54,120
was the reason why they didn't they
 

6041
02:48:54,120 --> 02:48:55,550
was the reason why they didn't they
didn't turn me down at the spot there

6042
02:48:55,550 --> 02:48:55,560
didn't turn me down at the spot there
 

6043
02:48:55,560 --> 02:48:57,110
didn't turn me down at the spot there
they they were like okay the test is

oh
I just wanted to be

6130
02:50:45,170 --> 02:50:45,180
I just wanted to be
 

6131
02:50:45,180 --> 02:50:47,929
I just wanted to be
honest about it I was hoping that

6132
02:50:47,929 --> 02:50:47,939
honest about it I was hoping that
 

6133
02:50:47,939 --> 02:50:49,370
honest about it I was hoping that
they would

6134
02:50:49,370 --> 02:50:49,380
they would
 

6135
02:50:49,380 --> 02:50:54,349
they would
not care about it but they did um

6136
02:50:54,349 --> 02:50:54,359

 

6137
02:50:54,359 --> 02:50:56,510

all right so that was that yeah I think

6138
02:50:56,510 --> 02:50:56,520
all right so that was that yeah I think
 

6139
02:50:56,520 --> 02:50:58,370
all right so that was that yeah I think
I think it's a physically very taxing

6140
02:50:58,370 --> 02:50:58,380
I think it's a physically very taxing
 

6141
02:50:58,380 --> 02:50:59,990
I think it's a physically very taxing
job but I do think that I would have

6142
02:50:59,990 --> 02:51:00,000
job but I do think that I would have
 

6143
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:01,730
job but I do think that I would have
been able to handle it

6144
02:51:01,730 --> 02:51:01,740
been able to handle it
 

6145

um oh there's lots for excluding someone
 

6157
02:51:18,479 --> 02:51:23,450
um oh there's lots for excluding someone
for medical reasons

6158
02:51:23,450 --> 02:51:23,460

 

6159
02:51:23,460 --> 02:51:25,370

but I don't know it makes sense like

6160
02:51:25,370 --> 02:51:25,380
but I don't know it makes sense like
 

6161
02:51:25,380 --> 02:51:28,250
but I don't know it makes sense like
obviously let's say you have a

6162
02:51:28,250 --> 02:51:28,260
obviously let's say you have a
 

6163
02:51:28,260 --> 02:51:31,010
obviously let's say you have a
let's say okay let's say for example you

6164
02:51:31,010 --> 02:51:31,020
let's say okay let's say for example you
 

6165
02:51:31,020 --> 02:51:33,230
let's say okay let's say for example you
are in a wheelchair and you apply for a

6166
02:51:33,230 --> 02:51:33,240
are in a wheelchair and you apply for a
 

6167
02:51:33,240 --> 02:51:35,690
are in a wheelchair and you apply for a
job at an airline

6168
02:51:35,690 --> 02:51:35,700
job at an airline
 

6169
02:51:35,700 --> 02:51:38,990
job at an airline
uh isn't it an obvious reason that you

6170
02:51:38,990 --> 02:51:39,000
uh isn't it an obvious reason that you
 

6171
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:41,870
uh isn't it an obvious reason that you
can't do that job

6172
02:51:41,870 --> 02:51:41,880
can't do that job
 

6173
02:51:41,880 --> 02:51:43,030
can't do that job
right right

6174
02:51:43,030 --> 02:51:43,040
right right
 

6175
02:51:43,040 --> 02:51:45,830
right right
so they

6176
02:51:45,830 --> 02:51:45,840
so they
 

6177
02:51:45,840 --> 02:51:47,469
so they
um

6178
02:51:47,469 --> 02:51:47,479
um
 

6179
02:51:47,479 --> 02:51:49,969
um
that's uh

6180
02:51:49,969 --> 02:51:49,979
that's uh
 

6181
02:51:49,979 --> 02:51:52,910
that's uh
yeah for Airlines they also for Pilots

6182
02:51:52,910 --> 02:51:52,920
yeah for Airlines they also for Pilots
 

6183
02:51:52,920 --> 02:51:54,769
yeah for Airlines they also for Pilots
it's even more important that they don't

6184
02:51:54,769 --> 02:51:54,779
it's even more important that they don't
 

6185
02:51:54,779 --> 02:51:56,330
it's even more important that they don't
have some kind of

6186
02:51:56,330 --> 02:51:56,340
have some kind of
 

6187
02:51:56,340 --> 02:52:00,349
have some kind of
uh disability or illness or whatever you

6193
02:52:05,040 --> 02:52:08,650

is

6194
02:52:08,650 --> 02:52:08,660

 

6195

um

6206
02:52:33,250 --> 02:52:33,260

 

6207
02:52:33,260 --> 02:52:35,750

of blood tests they would do and I think

6214
02:52:42,410 --> 02:52:42,420
of blood tests they would do and I think
 

6215
02:52:42,420 --> 02:52:46,130
of blood tests they would do and I think
if you test specifically for these

6216
02:52:46,130 --> 02:52:46,140
if you test specifically for these
 

6217
02:52:46,140 --> 02:52:47,750
if you test specifically for these
things then you would have seen it in my

6218
02:52:47,750 --> 02:52:47,760
things then you would have seen it in my
 

6219
02:52:47,760 --> 02:52:49,550
things then you would have seen it in my
blood but

6220
02:52:49,550 --> 02:52:49,560
blood but
 

6221
02:52:49,560 --> 02:52:50,150
blood but
um

6222
02:52:50,150 --> 02:52:50,160
um
 

6223
02:52:50,160 --> 02:52:52,070
um
it was just a basic blood test but how

6224
02:52:52,070 --> 02:52:52,080
it was just a basic blood test but how
 

6225
02:52:52,080 --> 02:52:53,330
it was just a basic blood test but how
could I have known it I needed to make

6226
02:52:53,330 --> 02:52:53,340
could I have known it I needed to make
 

6227
02:52:53,340 --> 02:52:54,530
could I have known it I needed to make
sure

6228
02:52:54,530 --> 02:52:54,540
sure
 

6229
02:52:54,540 --> 02:52:56,690
sure
because if they would have found it and

6230
02:52:56,690 --> 02:52:56,700
because if they would have found it and
 

6231
02:52:56,700 --> 02:52:58,969
because if they would have found it and
I didn't say it because they were asking

6232
02:52:58,969 --> 02:52:58,979

that path where we just saw this note

11468
05:28:18,948 --> 05:28:18,958

 

11469
05:28:18,958 --> 05:28:20,448

what is that really the right path

11472
05:28:22,730 --> 05:28:22,740
what is that really the right path
 

11473
05:28:22,740 --> 05:28:24,470
what is that really the right path
because normally the snoot paths are

11474
05:28:24,470 --> 05:28:24,480
because normally the snoot paths are
 

11475
05:28:24,480 --> 05:28:26,628
because normally the snoot paths are
really only for the memory and not used

11476
05:28:26,628 --> 05:28:26,638
really only for the memory and not used
 

11477
05:28:26,638 --> 05:28:29,810
really only for the memory and not used

baby played it with the controller from
 

14889
07:13:21,120 --> 07:13:23,810
baby played it with the controller from
the get-go but I did it with the um

14890

the get-go but I did it with the um
 

14891

the get-go but I did it with the um
keyboard and then switching in between
