okay and

446
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:30,600

 

447
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,590

220% yeah I guess we'll spend all of

448
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:33,600
220% yeah I guess we'll spend all of
 

449
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,189
220% yeah I guess we'll spend all of
that so next skill point I can put

450
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:35,199
that so next skill point I can put
 

451
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:37,069
that so next skill point I can put
something into physician what does that

452

microphone you get exp from that but
 

477
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,069
microphone you get exp from that but
probably not

478
00:14:11,069 --> 00:14:11,079

much yeah the The Cure yeah that's
something that I was hope it for that's

482
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:15,880
something that I was hope it for that's
 

483
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,949
something that I was hope it for that's
the reason why I'm looking at that yeah

484
00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:18,959
the reason why I'm looking at that yeah
 

485
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:23,269
the reason why I'm looking at that yeah
um and then later I'm thinking about

486
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:23,279
um and then later I'm thinking about
 

487
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,949
um and then later I'm thinking about
where are those

488
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:24,959
where are those
 

489
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:29,949
where are those
skills uh yeah um I might you know I I

490
00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:29,959
skills uh yeah um I might you know I I
 

491
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:32,110
skills uh yeah um I might you know I I
actually will put maybe one point into

492
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:32,120
actually will put maybe one point into
 

493
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,550
actually will put maybe one point into
this

494
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:33,560
this
 

495
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:38,910
this
now uh reduce costs and stuff yeah okay

496
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:38,920
now uh reduce costs and stuff yeah okay
 

497
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,269
now uh reduce costs and stuff yeah okay
and then eventually I might put stuff

498
00:14:40,269 --> 00:14:40,279
and then eventually I might put stuff
 

499
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:43,790
and then eventually I might put stuff
into Grease Monkey too yeah and then I I

500
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:43,800
into Grease Monkey too yeah and then I I
 

501
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,389
into Grease Monkey too yeah and then I I

I will say though is that if if you are

6874
02:59:15,469 --> 02:59:15,479
I will say though is that if if you are
 

6875
02:59:15,479 --> 02:59:17,830
I will say though is that if if you are
using clubs and you want to level both

6876
02:59:17,830 --> 02:59:17,840
using clubs and you want to level both
 

6877
02:59:17,840 --> 02:59:19,830
using clubs and you want to level both
your your shotgun and Club strength at

6878
02:59:19,830 --> 02:59:19,840
your your shotgun and Club strength at
 

6879
02:59:19,840 --> 02:59:21,950
your your shotgun and Club strength at
the same time like they shotguns and

6880
02:59:21,950 --> 02:59:21,960
the same time like they shotguns and
 

6881
02:59:21,960 --> 02:59:24,990
the same time like they shotguns and
clubs use the same strength metric so if

6882
02:59:24,990 --> 02:59:25,000
clubs use the same strength metric so if
 

6883
02:59:25,000 --> 02:59:27,190
clubs use the same strength metric so if
you wanted to use shotgun might be a

6884
02:59:27,190 --> 02:59:27,200
you wanted to use shotgun might be a
 

6885
02:59:27,200 --> 02:59:29,510
you wanted to use shotgun might be a
good idea cuz you could minmax it a

6886
02:59:29,510 --> 02:59:29,520
good idea cuz you could minmax it a
 

6887
02:59:29,520 --> 02:59:32,150
good idea cuz you could minmax it a
little better but I'll I'll I I think

maybe we

9884
04:19:41,389 --> 04:19:41,399
maybe we
 

9885
04:19:41,399 --> 04:19:43,149
maybe we
can uh

9886
04:19:43,149 --> 04:19:43,159

9887
04:19:43,159 --> 04:19:45,510

9890
04:19:46,990 --> 04:19:47,000
but they don't have to in the end it
 

9891
04:19:47,000 --> 04:19:49,229
but they don't have to in the end it
scales like with the quests too as far

9892
04:19:49,229 --> 04:19:49,239
scales like with the quests too as far
 

9893
04:19:49,239 --> 04:19:52,550
scales like with the quests too as far
as I know the EXP they get scales and

9894
04:19:52,550 --> 04:19:52,560
as I know the EXP they get scales and
 

9895
04:19:52,560 --> 04:19:55,229
as I know the EXP they get scales and
the difficulty of the hordes everything

9896
04:19:55,229 --> 04:19:55,239
the difficulty of the hordes everything
 

9897
04:19:55,239 --> 04:19:57,750
the difficulty of the hordes everything
scales

9898
04:19:57,750 --> 04:19:57,760
scales
 

9899
04:19:57,760 --> 04:20:00,149
scales
although that hord was pretty difficult

9900
04:20:00,149 --> 04:20:00,159
although that hord was pretty difficult
 

9901
04:20:00,159 --> 04:20:01,349
although that hord was pretty difficult
so I

9902
04:20:01,349 --> 04:20:01,359
so I
 

9903
04:20:01,359 --> 04:20:06,189
so I
think uh it cares more about the US like

9904
04:20:06,189 --> 04:20:06,199
think uh it cares more about the US like
 

9905
