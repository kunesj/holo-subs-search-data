yeah well i just realized before the
 

211
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,030
yeah well i just realized before the
stream that i'm the only one who is

212
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,040
stream that i'm the only one who is
 

213
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,069
stream that i'm the only one who is
left-handed in the group so

214
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:04,079
left-handed in the group so
 

215
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,230
left-handed in the group so
but since they're wrestling with the

00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:06,240
but since they're wrestling with the
 

217
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,389
but since they're wrestling with the
right hand i would have to probably

218
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:08,399
right hand i would have to probably
 

219
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,670
right hand i would have to probably
wrestle with the right hand too

220
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:09,680
wrestle with the right hand too
 

221
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,509
wrestle with the right hand too
otherwise it doesn't really work
