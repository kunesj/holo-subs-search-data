underneath because then for
 

5113
02:32:09,319 --> 02:32:11,990
underneath because then for
example uh although it depends it

5114
02:32:11,990 --> 02:32:12,000
example uh although it depends it
 

5115
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,429
example uh although it depends it
depends then actually so it should be

5116
02:32:14,429 --> 02:32:14,439
depends then actually so it should be

03:09:45,870 --> 03:09:45,880

 

6643
03:09:45,880 --> 03:09:51,349

serious now like can try to follow the

6644
03:09:51,349 --> 03:09:51,359

 

6645
03:09:51,359 --> 03:09:53,550

trends public dance streams in the

6646
03:09:53,550 --> 03:09:53,560
trends public dance streams in the
 

6647
03:09:53,560 --> 03:09:55,030
trends public dance streams in the
future

6648
03:09:55,030 --> 03:09:55,040
future
 

6649
03:09:55,040 --> 03:09:58,389
future
M I might

6650
03:09:58,389 --> 03:09:58,399
M I might
 

6651
03:09:58,399 --> 03:10:02,550
M I might
wait uh a couple months for

6652
03:10:02,550 --> 03:10:02,560
wait uh a couple months for
 

6653
03:10:02,560 --> 03:10:05,269
wait uh a couple months for
that about vertical oh I can do a

6654
03:10:05,269 --> 03:10:05,279
that about vertical oh I can do a
 

6655
03:10:05,279 --> 03:10:08,710
that about vertical oh I can do a
vertical dance stream yeah let's go but

6656
03:10:08,710 --> 03:10:08,720
vertical dance stream yeah let's go but
 

6657
03:10:08,720 --> 03:10:11,670
vertical dance stream yeah let's go but
I'm not quite happy with the quality

6658
03:10:11,670 --> 03:10:11,680
I'm not quite happy with the quality
 

6659
03:10:11,680 --> 03:10:19,349
I'm not quite happy with the quality
of it yet in live streaming uh

6660
03:10:19,349 --> 03:10:19,359

 

6661
03:10:19,359 --> 03:10:22,910

option because of those weird there's

6662
03:10:22,910 --> 03:10:22,920
option because of those weird there's
 

6663
03:10:22,920 --> 03:10:25,469
option because of those weird there's
some weird movements that happen in the

6664
03:10:25,469 --> 03:10:25,479
some weird movements that happen in the
 

6665
03:10:25,479 --> 03:10:27,750
some weird movements that happen in the
retargeting process right we talked

6666
03:10:27,750 --> 03:10:27,760
retargeting process right we talked
 

6667
03:10:27,760 --> 03:10:28,830
retargeting process right we talked
about

6668
03:10:28,830 --> 03:10:28,840
about
 

6669
03:10:28,840 --> 03:10:32,910
about
this that I don't like

6670
03:10:32,910 --> 03:10:32,920
this that I don't like
 

6671
03:10:32,920 --> 03:10:37,870
this that I don't like
and the goo team is making a software

6672
03:10:37,870 --> 03:10:37,880
and the goo team is making a software
 

6673
03:10:37,880 --> 03:10:39,590
and the goo team is making a software
that will fix it but it's still taking

6674
03:10:39,590 --> 03:10:39,600
that will fix it but it's still taking
 

6675
03:10:39,600 --> 03:10:42,469
that will fix it but it's still taking
them a while and then they'll let me use

6676
03:10:42,469 --> 03:10:42,479
them a while and then they'll let me use
 

6677
03:10:42,479 --> 03:10:45,389
them a while and then they'll let me use
it those freaking

6678
03:10:45,389 --> 03:10:45,399
it those freaking
 

6679
03:10:45,399 --> 03:10:48,990

Angels now no nobody besides me uses

6680
03:10:48,990 --> 03:10:49,000
Angels now no nobody besides me uses
 

6681
03:10:49,000 --> 03:10:53,990
Angels now no nobody besides me uses
Accents in cover as far as I know as far

6682
03:10:53,990 --> 03:10:54,000
Accents in cover as far as I know as far
 

6683
03:10:54,000 --> 03:10:56,110
Accents in cover as far as I know as far
I even asked them if they can help me

6684
03:10:56,110 --> 03:10:56,120
I even asked them if they can help me
 

6685
03:10:56,120 --> 03:10:58,550
I even asked them if they can help me
with it nobody uses it I can use it with

6686
03:10:58,550 --> 03:10:58,560
with it nobody uses it I can use it with
 

6687
03:10:58,560 --> 03:11:03,150
with it nobody uses it I can use it with
my app but nobody uses it so there's

6688
03:11:03,150 --> 03:11:03,160
my app but nobody uses it so there's
 

6689
03:11:03,160 --> 03:11:06,190
my app but nobody uses it so there's
no reason for them

6690
03:11:06,190 --> 03:11:06,200
no reason for them
 

6691
03:11:06,200 --> 03:11:11,710
no reason for them
to like make our app uh fix that

6692
03:11:11,710 --> 03:11:11,720
to like make our app uh fix that
 

6693
03:11:11,720 --> 03:11:14,950
to like make our app uh fix that
retargeting issue there's no reason for

6694
03:11:14,950 --> 03:11:14,960
retargeting issue there's no reason for
 

6695
03:11:14,960 --> 03:11:18,229
retargeting issue there's no reason for
them now go company they're all using

6696
03:11:18,229 --> 03:11:18,239
them now go company they're all using
 

6697
03:11:18,239 --> 03:11:21,150

accents so they have a reason to work on

6698
03:11:21,150 --> 03:11:21,160
accents so they have a reason to work on
 

6699
03:11:21,160 --> 03:11:23,590
accents so they have a reason to work on
that so I'm I'm actually going to wait

6700
03:11:23,590 --> 03:11:23,600
that so I'm I'm actually going to wait
 

6701
03:11:23,600 --> 03:11:25,389
that so I'm I'm actually going to wait
for their

6702
03:11:25,389 --> 03:11:25,399
for their
 

6703
03:11:25,399 --> 03:11:27,990
for their
software yeah that's that's the only

6704
03:11:27,990 --> 03:11:28,000
software yeah that's that's the only
 

6705
03:11:28,000 --> 03:11:29,510
software yeah that's that's the only
thing I can really

6706
03:11:29,510 --> 03:11:29,520
thing I can really
 

6707
03:11:29,520 --> 03:11:32,670
thing I can really
do it's it seems to be a pretty

6708
03:11:32,670 --> 03:11:32,680
do it's it seems to be a pretty
 

6709
03:11:32,680 --> 03:11:35,910
do it's it seems to be a pretty
difficult

6710
03:11:35,910 --> 03:11:35,920

 

6711
03:11:35,920 --> 03:11:39,190

thing they're working really hard on it

6712
03:11:39,190 --> 03:11:39,200
thing they're working really hard on it
 

6713
03:11:39,200 --> 03:11:43,990
thing they're working really hard on it
doesn't seem like such an easy thing to

6714
03:11:43,990 --> 03:11:44,000
doesn't seem like such an easy thing to
 

6715
03:11:44,000 --> 03:11:47,469
doesn't seem like such an easy thing to
fix it's like only happening

6716
03:11:47,469 --> 03:11:47,479
fix it's like only happening
 

6717
03:11:47,479 --> 03:11:51,349
fix it's like only happening
when you send the data from the exent

6718
03:11:51,349 --> 03:11:51,359
when you send the data from the exent

software live to another program like

6720
03:11:56,150 --> 03:11:56,160
software live to another program like
 

6721
03:11:56,160 --> 03:12:00,790
software live to another program like
our app or theu app where you can see

6722
03:12:00,790 --> 03:12:00,800
our app or theu app where you can see
 

6723
03:12:00,800 --> 03:12:04,070
our app or theu app where you can see
then the motion live on your own

6724
03:12:04,070 --> 03:12:04,080
then the motion live on your own
 

6725
03:12:04,080 --> 03:12:06,309
then the motion live on your own
model that's where the retargeting

6726
03:12:06,309 --> 03:12:06,319
model that's where the retargeting
 

6727
03:12:06,319 --> 03:12:08,950
model that's where the retargeting
happens that's the only only place where

6728
03:12:08,950 --> 03:12:08,960
happens that's the only only place where
 

6729
03:12:08,960 --> 03:12:11,790
happens that's the only only place where
reason why it happens if it was only if

6730
03:12:11,790 --> 03:12:11,800
reason why it happens if it was only if
 

6731
03:12:11,800 --> 03:12:15,990
reason why it happens if it was only if
I was only live streaming the screen of

6732
03:12:15,990 --> 03:12:16,000
I was only live streaming the screen of
 

6733
03:12:16,000 --> 03:12:20,429
I was only live streaming the screen of
my uh accents motion capture software

6734
03:12:20,429 --> 03:12:20,439
my uh accents motion capture software
 

6735
03:12:20,439 --> 03:12:23,469
my uh accents motion capture software
then you wouldn't see those issues I

6736
03:12:23,469 --> 03:12:23,479
then you wouldn't see those issues I
 

6737
03:12:23,479 --> 03:12:26,950
then you wouldn't see those issues I
think I think it just looks uh normal

6738
03:12:26,950 --> 03:12:26,960
think I think it just looks uh normal
 

6739
03:12:26,960 --> 03:12:29,429
think I think it just looks uh normal
and then it sends the motion cture data

6740
03:12:29,429 --> 03:12:29,439
and then it sends the motion cture data
 

6741
03:12:29,439 --> 03:12:31,590
and then it sends the motion cture data
live to the other program and that's

6742
03:12:31,590 --> 03:12:31,600
live to the other program and that's
 

6743
03:12:31,600 --> 03:12:34,590
live to the other program and that's
where it [\h__\h] it

6744
03:12:34,590 --> 03:12:34,600

9636
04:32:35,070 --> 04:32:35,080
know the game could have worked without
 

9637
04:32:35,080 --> 04:32:37,870
know the game could have worked without
that on its

9638
04:32:37,870 --> 04:32:37,880
that on its
 

9639
04:32:37,880 --> 04:32:42,349
that on its
own it wasn't necessary for the game

9640
04:32:42,349 --> 04:32:42,359
own it wasn't necessary for the game
 

9641
04:32:42,359 --> 04:32:46,349
own it wasn't necessary for the game
so that kind of almost makes it a filler

9642
04:32:46,349 --> 04:32:46,359
so that kind of almost makes it a filler
 

9643
04:32:46,359 --> 04:32:49,189
so that kind of almost makes it a filler

9645
04:32:49,199 --> 04:32:51,590

are better than the ichon parts I don't
agree with that I

9648
04:32:57,189 --> 04:32:57,199

9652
04:33:04,189 --> 04:33:04,199

9653
04:33:04,199 --> 04:33:06,109
agree that they the fights but that's I
don't know was that really just the

9654
04:33:06,109 --> 04:33:06,119
don't know was that really just the
 

9655
04:33:06,119 --> 04:33:08,910
don't know was that really just the
problem with this one I don't know if

9656
04:33:08,910 --> 04:33:08,920
problem with this one I don't know if
 

9657
04:33:08,920 --> 04:33:12,551
problem with this one I don't know if
the fights were really so much more

9658
04:33:12,551 --> 04:33:12,561
the fights were really so much more
 

9659
04:33:12,561 --> 04:33:18,869
the fights were really so much more
lengthy and

9660
04:33:18,869 --> 04:33:18,879

 

9661
04:33:18,879 --> 04:33:22,150

often than in other Yakuza games there's

9662
04:33:22,150 --> 04:33:22,160
often than in other Yakuza games there's
 

9663
04:33:22,160 --> 04:33:25,189
often than in other Yakuza games there's
always a lot of

9664
04:33:25,189 --> 04:33:25,199

 

9665

9671
04:33:35,119 --> 04:33:36,949

makes sense the thought that I had that

9672
04:33:36,949 --> 04:33:36,959
