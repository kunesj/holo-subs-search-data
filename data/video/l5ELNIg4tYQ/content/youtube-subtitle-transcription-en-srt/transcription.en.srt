about this one second hand when I had no
 

291

about this one second hand when I had no

there's I think one venue that would

5670
02:26:54,410 --> 02:26:54,420
there's I think one venue that would
 

5671
02:26:54,420 --> 02:26:57,110
there's I think one venue that would
really fit is the Budokan but they don't

5672
02:26:57,110 --> 02:26:57,120
really fit is the Budokan but they don't
 

5673
02:26:57,120 --> 02:26:59,750
really fit is the Budokan but they don't
have like an expo

5674

have like an expo
 

5675
02:26:59,760 --> 02:27:02,630
have like an expo
suitable venue there I think they're all

5676
02:27:02,630 --> 02:27:02,640
suitable venue there I think they're all
 

5677
02:27:02,640 --> 02:27:06,070
suitable venue there I think they're all
like for concerts only

5678
02:27:06,070 --> 02:27:06,080

 

5679
02:27:06,080 --> 02:27:08,690

is very big though

5680
02:27:08,690 --> 02:27:08,700
is very big though
 

5681
02:27:08,700 --> 02:27:11,450
is very big though
but maybe maybe maybe

5682
02:27:11,450 --> 02:27:11,460
but maybe maybe maybe
 

5683
02:27:11,460 --> 02:27:13,790
but maybe maybe maybe
I guess you could also like increase the

5684
02:27:13,790 --> 02:27:13,800
I guess you could also like increase the
 

5685
02:27:13,800 --> 02:27:16,550
I guess you could also like increase the
days but I don't really like that either

5686
02:27:16,550 --> 02:27:16,560
days but I don't really like that either
 

5687
02:27:16,560 --> 02:27:18,230
days but I don't really like that either
because if they increase the days maybe

5688
02:27:18,230 --> 02:27:18,240
because if they increase the days maybe
 

5689
02:27:18,240 --> 02:27:19,790
because if they increase the days maybe
that means they're also split the

5690
02:27:19,790 --> 02:27:19,800
that means they're also split the
 

5691
02:27:19,800 --> 02:27:22,130
that means they're also split the
members even more

5692
02:27:22,130 --> 02:27:22,140

5693
02:27:22,140 --> 02:27:25,730
