1743
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,970
other direction though because there's
never Shrine there

1744
00:54:58,970 --> 00:54:58,980
never Shrine there
 

1745
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:02,450
never Shrine there
uh this way I think

1746
00:55:02,450 --> 00:55:02,460

 

1747
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:04,430

I'm so slow in this

1748
00:55:04,430 --> 00:55:04,440
I'm so slow in this
 

1749
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:09,049
I'm so slow in this
let me make um

1750
00:55:09,049 --> 00:55:09,059

 

1751
00:55:09,059 --> 00:55:12,049

why am I why am I actually I'm pressing

1752
00:55:12,049 --> 00:55:12,059
why am I why am I actually I'm pressing
 

1753
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:15,430
why am I why am I actually I'm pressing
uh next to that

1754
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:15,440
uh next to that
 

1755
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,950
uh next to that
long too strong I guess

1756
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:18,960
long too strong I guess
 

1757
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:22,490
long too strong I guess
because I'm activating my

1758
00:55:22,490 --> 00:55:22,500

 

1759
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:26,690

thingy uh

1760
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:26,700

 

1761
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:40,150

I don't think I ever made a sled before

1762
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:40,160

 

1763
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:43,790

diagonally oh perfect I think that's all

1764
00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:43,800
diagonally oh perfect I think that's all
 

1765
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,950
diagonally oh perfect I think that's all
I need or maybe oh wait it's the other

1766
00:55:45,950 --> 00:55:45,960
I need or maybe oh wait it's the other
 

1767
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:52,569
I need or maybe oh wait it's the other
way around oh yeah

1768
00:55:52,569 --> 00:55:52,579

 

1769
00:55:52,579 --> 00:55:54,890

I don't think I ever got a recipe for

00:57:50,809 --> 00:57:50,819
unless I take something with
 

1849
00:57:50,819 --> 00:57:53,329
unless I take something with
freezing

1850
00:57:53,329 --> 00:57:53,339
freezing
 

1851
00:57:53,339 --> 00:57:57,170
freezing
maybe that's worth it because

1852
00:57:57,170 --> 00:57:57,180

 

1853
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:58,910

do I still have something with freezing

1854
00:57:58,910 --> 00:57:58,920
do I still have something with freezing
 

1855
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:00,650
do I still have something with freezing
protection

1856
00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:00,660
protection
 

1857
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:04,490
protection
cold resistance five minutes

1858
00:58:04,490 --> 00:58:04,500

 

1859
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:07,309

and this one two seven

1860
00:58:07,309 --> 00:58:07,319
and this one two seven
 

1861
00:58:07,319 --> 00:58:14,150
and this one two seven
Thirty

1862
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:14,160

 

1863
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:16,549

I prefer having more

1864
00:58:16,549 --> 00:58:16,559
I prefer having more
 

1865
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:29,569
I prefer having more
that wasn't enough

1866
00:58:29,569 --> 00:58:29,579

 

1867
00:58:29,579 --> 00:58:31,910

it doesn't have to be two stars

1868
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:31,920
it doesn't have to be two stars
 

1869
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,630
it doesn't have to be two stars
they're all one star

1870
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:34,640
they're all one star
 

1871
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,890
they're all one star
but then it should be enough to at least

1872
00:58:36,890 --> 00:58:36,900
but then it should be enough to at least
 

1873
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:39,890
but then it should be enough to at least
take uh like one more piece of armor

1874
00:58:39,890 --> 00:58:39,900
take uh like one more piece of armor
 

1875
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:41,150
take uh like one more piece of armor
right

1876
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:41,160
right
 

1877
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:42,470
right
so

1878
00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:42,480
so
 

1879
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:48,770
so
this is okay

1880
00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:48,780

 

1881
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:50,450

and then

1882
00:58:50,450 --> 00:58:50,460
and then
 

1883
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:53,089
and then
I haven't used this one since my last

1884
00:58:53,089 --> 00:58:53,099
I haven't used this one since my last
 

1885
00:58:53,099 --> 00:58:57,829
I haven't used this one since my last
Lino fight but it's useful this one too

1886
00:58:57,829 --> 00:58:57,839
Lino fight but it's useful this one too
 

1887
00:58:57,839 --> 00:59:00,470
Lino fight but it's useful this one too
to have higher chances of you know

1888
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:00,480
to have higher chances of you know
 

1889
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:03,109
to have higher chances of you know
getting the shots in

1890
00:59:03,109 --> 00:59:03,119
getting the shots in
 

1891
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:05,450
getting the shots in
and then we can

1892
00:59:05,450 --> 00:59:05,460
and then we can
 

1893
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:11,270
and then we can
maybe this

1894
00:59:11,270 --> 00:59:11,280

 

1895
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:15,170

higher my highest damage is

1896
00:59:15,170 --> 00:59:15,180
higher my highest damage is
 

1897
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:18,589
higher my highest damage is
these ones Maybe

1898
00:59:18,589 --> 00:59:18,599

yeah
went for all the travel just to wake up

6024
02:59:42,230 --> 02:59:42,240
went for all the travel just to wake up
 

6025
02:59:42,240 --> 02:59:43,730
went for all the travel just to wake up
to three just to be able to find the

6026
02:59:43,730 --> 02:59:43,740
to three just to be able to find the
 

6027
02:59:43,740 --> 02:59:47,450
to three just to be able to find the
master sword when you have it all along

6028
02:59:47,450 --> 02:59:47,460

 

6029
02:59:47,460 --> 02:59:49,790

is he the one

6030
02:59:49,790 --> 02:59:49,800
is he the one
 

6031
02:59:49,800 --> 02:59:51,590
is he the one
after you wake him up that gives you

6032
02:59:51,590 --> 02:59:51,600
after you wake him up that gives you
 

6033
02:59:51,600 --> 02:59:54,110
after you wake him up that gives you
like a like a hint

6034
02:59:54,110 --> 02:59:54,120
like a like a hint
 

6035
02:59:54,120 --> 02:59:56,389
like a like a hint
oh also do I

6036
02:59:56,389 --> 02:59:56,399
oh also do I
 

6037
02:59:56,399 --> 03:00:00,889
oh also do I
how do I get back

6038
03:00:00,889 --> 03:00:00,899

 

6039
03:00:00,899 --> 03:00:03,889

to the shrine maybe really and that's

6040
03:00:03,889 --> 03:00:03,899
to the shrine maybe really and that's
 

6041
03:00:03,899 --> 03:00:07,070
to the shrine maybe really and that's
what that's that's what he's for

6042
03:00:07,070 --> 03:00:07,080
what that's that's what he's for
 

6043
03:00:07,080 --> 03:00:09,530
what that's that's what he's for
I guess that makes sense because

6044
03:00:09,530 --> 03:00:09,540
I guess that makes sense because
 

6045
03:00:09,540 --> 03:00:10,610
I guess that makes sense because
um

6046
03:00:10,610 --> 03:00:10,620
um
 

6047
03:00:10,620 --> 03:00:12,230
um
but

6048
03:00:12,230 --> 03:00:12,240
but
 

6049
03:00:12,240 --> 03:00:15,170
but
I think there will be many cases where

6050
03:00:15,170 --> 03:00:15,180
I think there will be many cases where
 

6051
03:00:15,180 --> 03:00:17,269
I think there will be many cases where
there wasn't a sand spot

6052
03:00:17,269 --> 03:00:17,279
there wasn't a sand spot
 

6053
03:00:17,279 --> 03:00:18,349
there wasn't a sand spot
oh

6054
03:00:18,349 --> 03:00:18,359
oh
 

6055
03:00:18,359 --> 03:00:19,849
oh
I think there would be many cases where

6056
03:00:19,849 --> 03:00:19,859
I think there would be many cases where
 

6057
03:00:19,859 --> 03:00:23,269
I think there would be many cases where
people already have the master sword

6058
03:00:23,269 --> 03:00:23,279
people already have the master sword
 

6059
03:00:23,279 --> 03:00:25,330
people already have the master sword
on it

6060
03:00:25,330 --> 03:00:25,340
on it
 

6061
03:00:25,340 --> 03:00:30,370
on it
I may have gone to the wrong place

6062
03:00:30,370 --> 03:00:30,380

 

6063
03:00:30,380 --> 03:00:38,050

where do I go

6064
03:00:38,050 --> 03:00:38,060

 

6065
03:00:38,060 --> 03:00:41,690

this is why you got the master sword

6066
03:00:41,690 --> 03:00:41,700
this is why you got the master sword
 

6067
