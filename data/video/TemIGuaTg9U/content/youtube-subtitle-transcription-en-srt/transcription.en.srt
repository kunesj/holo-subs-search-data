2003
00:52:08,579 --> 00:52:11,329
picked the right one the one that has uh
super cute girls if they're a mini game

2004
00:52:11,329 --> 00:52:11,339
super cute girls if they're a mini game

00:52:13,319 --> 00:52:15,410
you have you have to play then you know
play Fatal Frame because that's and it's

2008
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:15,420
play Fatal Frame because that's and it's
 

2009
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:17,750
play Fatal Frame because that's and it's
basically just like taking pictures of

2010
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:17,760
basically just like taking pictures of
 

2011
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,970
basically just like taking pictures of
ghosts right like how hard can and how

2012
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:19,980
ghosts right like how hard can and how
 

2013
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:22,750
ghosts right like how hard can and how
scary can it be

2014
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:22,760
scary can it be
 

2015
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:25,430
scary can it be
I heard it's actually scary I just can't

2016
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:25,440
I heard it's actually scary I just can't
 

2017
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,530
I heard it's actually scary I just can't
imagine it being that bad

2018
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:27,540
imagine it being that bad
 

2019
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:32,450
imagine it being that bad
mama mama I guess um if um if it's any

2020
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:32,460
mama mama I guess um if um if it's any
 

2021
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:34,430
mama mama I guess um if um if it's any
consolation I think like the newer it

2022
00:52:34,430 --> 00:52:34,440
consolation I think like the newer it
 

2023
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,650
consolation I think like the newer it
gets the prettier the ghosts get and the

2024
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:36,660
gets the prettier the ghosts get and the
 

2025
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:40,390
gets the prettier the ghosts get and the
least scary it is

2026
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:40,400

 

2027
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:45,230

the prettier there's pretty ghosts

2028
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:45,240
the prettier there's pretty ghosts
 

2029
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:49,250
the prettier there's pretty ghosts
I guess so I mean if you you know if you

2030
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:49,260
I guess so I mean if you you know if you
 

2031
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:51,950
I guess so I mean if you you know if you
drop your standards into like the well

2032
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:51,960
drop your standards into like the well
 

2033
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,430
drop your standards into like the well
or something but uh

2034
00:52:54,430 --> 00:52:54,440
or something but uh
 

2035
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:57,829
or something but uh
I guess the logic is that uh the newer

2036
00:52:57,829 --> 00:52:57,839
I guess the logic is that uh the newer
 

2037
00:52:57,839 --> 00:52:59,990
I guess the logic is that uh the newer
the game is the better the you know the

2038
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:00,000
the game is the better the you know the
 

2039
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,549
the game is the better the you know the
3D and everything and then they pay more

2040
00:53:01,549 --> 00:53:01,559
3D and everything and then they pay more
 

2041
00:53:01,559 --> 00:53:03,170
3D and everything and then they pay more
attention to like the people's face and

2042
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:03,180
attention to like the people's face and
 

2043
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:06,650
attention to like the people's face and
and then the not people's faces so even

2044
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:06,660
and then the not people's faces so even
 

2045
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:08,329
and then the not people's faces so even
though the ghosts are like

2046
00:53:08,329 --> 00:53:08,339
though the ghosts are like
 

2047
00:53:08,339 --> 00:53:11,510
though the ghosts are like
I'm gonna kill you sometimes you can see

2048
00:53:11,510 --> 00:53:11,520
I'm gonna kill you sometimes you can see
 

2049
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,670
I'm gonna kill you sometimes you can see
maybe they're they don't look so bad

2050
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:13,680
maybe they're they don't look so bad
 

2051
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:16,130
maybe they're they don't look so bad
after all

2052
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:16,140
after all
 

2053
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:20,930
after all
on which uh uh console did you play It's

2054
00:53:20,930 --> 00:53:20,940
on which uh uh console did you play It's
 

2055
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:23,569
on which uh uh console did you play It's
kind of frame oh uh on stream I played

2056

on uh steam steam ah okay yeah there's
 

2059
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,210
on uh steam steam ah okay yeah there's
no because it's not like if you played

2060
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:29,220
no because it's not like if you played
 

2061
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:31,730
no because it's not like if you played
on Wii U and so on you have to like turn

2062
00:53:31,730 --> 00:53:31,740
on Wii U and so on you have to like turn
 

2063
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:35,150
on Wii U and so on you have to like turn
turn The the Wii U to like turn the

2064

2067
00:53:37,619 --> 00:53:39,829
camera and so on so it has like tilt
controls yeah I wonder how that works

2068
00:53:39,829 --> 00:53:39,839
controls yeah I wonder how that works
 

2069
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:41,630
controls yeah I wonder how that works
since team is maybe I don't know if it's

2070
00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:41,640
since team is maybe I don't know if it's
 

2071
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:45,049
since team is maybe I don't know if it's
easier to have it on Wii U or switch

2072
00:53:45,049 --> 00:53:45,059
easier to have it on Wii U or switch
 

2073
00:53:45,059 --> 00:53:47,510
easier to have it on Wii U or switch
there's no but I don't know I don't

2074
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:47,520

00:54:01,549 --> 00:54:01,559
yeah yeah yeah so what is this what is
 

2087
00:54:01,559 --> 00:54:03,290
yeah yeah yeah so what is this what is
this but

2088
00:54:03,290 --> 00:54:03,300
this but
 

2089
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:06,109
this but
um there's like a problem I think with

2090
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:06,119
um there's like a problem I think with
 

2091
00:54:06,119 --> 00:54:10,430
um there's like a problem I think with
uh I think like resolution and stuff so

2092
00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:10,440
uh I think like resolution and stuff so
 

2093
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:11,809
uh I think like resolution and stuff so
um yeah

2094
00:54:11,809 --> 00:54:11,819

01:01:31,609 --> 01:01:31,619
not too bad for me I guess I was still
 

2377
01:01:31,619 --> 01:01:34,490
not too bad for me I guess I was still
tired but for the N A members it was way

2378
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:34,500
tired but for the N A members it was way
 

2379
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:37,250
tired but for the N A members it was way
worse oh yeah they're suffering the

2380
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:37,260
worse oh yeah they're suffering the
 

2381
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:40,130
worse oh yeah they're suffering the
whole time and so tired they had no

2382
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:40,140
whole time and so tired they had no
 

2383
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:43,549
whole time and so tired they had no
energy and yeah and then it was so long

2384
01:01:43,549 --> 01:01:43,559
energy and yeah and then it was so long
 

2385
01:01:43,559 --> 01:01:46,130

right yes very long
um they were suffering through it so I

2388
01:01:48,349 --> 01:01:48,359
um they were suffering through it so I
 

2389
01:01:48,359 --> 01:01:50,510
um they were suffering through it so I
think this way it might be a bit better

2390
01:01:50,510 --> 01:01:50,520
think this way it might be a bit better
 

2391
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:53,690
think this way it might be a bit better
and I think you know

2392
01:01:53,690 --> 01:01:53,700
and I think you know
 

2393
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:54,530
and I think you know
um

2394
01:01:54,530 --> 01:01:54,540
um
 

2395
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:59,870
um
like if Ian if Ian wants to do something

2396
01:01:59,870 --> 01:01:59,880

what what's one more

4900
02:02:41,689 --> 02:02:41,699
what what's one more
 

4901
02:02:41,699 --> 02:02:44,689
what what's one more
spider web oh yeah like they can be in

4902
02:02:44,689 --> 02:02:44,699
spider web oh yeah like they can be in
 

4903
02:02:44,699 --> 02:02:46,250
spider web oh yeah like they can be in
the corners

4904
02:02:46,250 --> 02:02:46,260

4906
02:02:48,890 --> 02:02:48,900
like in the corner oh yeah I can try I
 

4907
02:02:48,900 --> 02:02:50,390
like in the corner oh yeah I can try I
can probably drawing it like in this

4908

can probably drawing it like in this
 

4909
02:02:50,400 --> 02:02:52,490
can probably drawing it like in this
corner because spider webs they don't

4910
02:02:52,490 --> 02:02:52,500
corner because spider webs they don't
 

4911

but I think we considered it more as a
 

5003
02:05:10,679 --> 02:05:13,189
but I think we considered it more as a
Christmas movie because of the title
